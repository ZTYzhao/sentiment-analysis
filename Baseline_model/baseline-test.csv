0,"The boys loved math, because \there is freedom, you can do anything.\"" What a great way to see math and numbers! I do not think the students realize that math could be taught differently.

0,I would like to start the year off by sharing some of these videos with my students.  Especially about mindset and making mistakes.  I think it is important for them to be aware of their habits and try to shift their way of thinking.
0,Great ideas. Asking students to illustrate how mistakes can lead to their learning is normalizing and encouraging to others.
0,"I think this falls on the teacher.  Someone spoke to this above... because if you have a teacher that is just terrible and doesn't know how to manage a class of mixed ability, you get very bored \gifted\"" students.  However, if the teacher knows how to differentiate properly, they can challenge your child, within the same confines of the concept being learned, at a deeper level.  Not just making your child do MORE work... but have your child do DIFFERENT work around the same topic.  Sometimes that can be as easy as asking one question to take it deeper.  The problem I've seen with this, however, is that sometimes those \""gifted\"" students still know in their head that they are getting different work.  They still think that they're smarter than the other kids, so they will tend to call the class boring.  Even though the teacher is definitely challenging the kid.  I've heard kids say, \""this class is easy\"" when I KNOW I have challenged them with difficult questions on a daily basis that they struggle with.  I had a girl tell me my Honors Geometry class (as an 8th grader) was easy.  I laughed... I said, \""This class isn't EASY!  You just got an A on a High School Geometry Honors Mid-Term.  That's hard to do!  It's not easy... I watch you work HARD every day!  I see you thinking... I see you struggle... I watch you debate... This is work!   And you work hard!  Just because you got an A, doesn't mean it's easy."""
0,"I think that it is a great way to see that students look at things differently.  In the video, it seemed like no two people saw the dot card in the same way.  It's a very open-ended strategy that reduces the pressure of students getting the wrong answer, as well as helps them see that numbers can be broken up in different ways."
0,"<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>You are so right.  I had a second niece last year in class----she hated math because she believed she was supposed to know the math coming in.  We worked on self-confidence and competing only for herself and against herself.  We talked about learning one new thing a day.  We talked about celebrating small victories.  I received a letter this year from her----she isn't having trouble in math; she said she wanted to thank me for believing in her and helping her believe in herself------she had learned that it wasn't all about the math, but what she brought to math and what she was willing put into math."
0,"Kids get negative messages about math from family and friends.  My mom told me that she couldn't do math, so that was probably why it was hard for me.  My dad, on the other hand, was great at math.  However, when I would ask him a question, he would try to explain it to me the way he worked through problems which was using a slide-rule.  I had never seen a slide-rule before, so was additionally stressed because I could not understand the tool he used!  Most of my friends had difficulty with math, so we would complain to each other about how awful it was."
0,"I agree,   If we use real world observations, field trips and hands-on group activities that hone critical thinking processes as the early foundation of mathematics the students creativity would be sparked."
0,"I believe that a terrible problem currently exists in mathematics education because students lack foundational knowledge. This fact, however, is primarily attributed to the teaching methods that are implemented in a majority of today's schools. So many math teachers are required to \cover the course material\"" that the true instruction is lost. The joy of student discover is not possible because of the time constrains placed by the school year."""
0,"I use these as a warm-up from Investigations Ten Minute Math.  The biggest problem is that ALL of the students want to share their methods, which is a great problem to have!"
0,"The more you try, the more you grow your brain. Right in the middle of the front of my room I have the statement \If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.'

Back to what Michelle Obama said, \""...it's hard work!...\""  \""Keep working at it, do you feel your brain?\""  I know the kids are feeling their brain working, we just need to focus on the positive of hard work. It's ok to feel your brain working and growing - it can be what we call \""frustration,\"" that's when you know your brain is growing!"""

0,I was impressed by how many different ways people saw these 10 dots.  I think it helps students realize there is not just one way to do a problem
0,"I was able to represent the first two problems conceptually so that students could understand but I was stuck on the third. Looking at how much they can paint together in one hour is a good way to approach it. I just had the math with no explanation. I approached the first one differently just using the slices purchased but quartering each so that would be accessible visually to students, even those who are uncomfortable with fractions.I want to bring more visuals and manipulatives into my classroom this year so this was a very helpful segment."
0,"Wow- this was a really cool way not only to get the students talking about math, but to allow them to see different ways of completing a problem. The bonus would be if the students developed an appreciation for each others diversity."
0,"This year, you may have a different experience than you have had in math class previously.  I am interested in your thinking and your learning.  I WILL give you problems that do not have just one way to be solved.  They WILL be difficult at times.  I expect you to put forth effort to try them, but I do NOT expect that you will get the right answer or even an answer at times.  The class will be about learning what we can from these difficult problems and our mistakes in order to make progress in our learning. I will not tell you a procedure for these problems.  Instead, I will be here to encourage you, ask you lots and lots of questions and learn along with you. None of us knows it all, and none of us will be the end of the year together.  I expect to learn about your thinking and hopefully some math as well. You should expect to learn about math but also about your own thinking. If you are putting forth effort and making progress, that is what will be valued instead of the number of questions right and wrong!"
0,"I have to say that I think for already-scarred students, it's going to take a whole lot more than lip service to convince them that mistakes are good. They've got lots of math and attitude stuff to unlearn. I don't think the research that says it takes longer to \unlearn\"" than to learn -- as in more practice, and more successes -- has been tossed, so I'm simply going to call that idea that we need students making mistakes all the time wrong.   It might work peachily for students accustomed to being right in other stuff... it definitely works for *me.*   I've had to learn from experience, though, that my students do much, much better if they get to practice the stuff they know enough to get past the working-memory-killing anxious part; when they have relaxed, then they can start making the connections."""
0,"When I enter my next class next week I will say:\Everybody can learn math\""It will take more effort from the students to persist learning math than to accept that the can learn."""
0,"Hello everyone.  I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, and I am a Computer Mathematics teacher at a middle school from West Virginia.  I have 25 years of mathematics teaching experience at the junior high/middle school levels.  My present position consisted of students completing mathematics lessons on the computer using the PLATO learning platform.  Then the county switched to APANGEA.  Last year the APANGEA learning platform changed its name to Think Through Math.  When students return to school in August, they will be using MATHIA from Carnegie.  I really look forward to this class, as I hope to gain some new ideas and learn from the recent research on strategies and techniques on how to get students to learn math.  This is extremely important because I teach in a low socio-economical school and whose student population is not real excited about mathematical learning."
0,"One thing the number cards do that I didn't see mentioned in the first few posts below is that they visually reinforce the idea that numbers can be broken up in many different ways. The discussion of the different ways people viewed the dots opens avenues for others to begin to consider how many different decompositions there are, and that these decompositions lead to many different arithmetic computations. Finally, the visual aspect of the exercise leaves a lasting impression almost like a puzzle that people might carry in the back of their minds as a reminder to think about numbers in different and use the relationships of the sub-parts to understand the numbers more deeply."
0,"I work with students on a one to one basis, so I don't necessarily \group\"" my students in any group in particular. But all that said, I see the results of students feeling like they're dumb and stupid when it comes to math. I don't know where they've heard these messages, but I do hope that message in their head changes. I've noticed that if I expect more from students, if they are available, then they will rise to the occasion and work hard. I also find that if I expect too much, they won't even begin the class and refuse to do anything. After viewing these videos I'm now curious about what it'd look like if we did group work, instead of one-to-one teaching. I think it'd be interesting to see my students working together with other students opposed to working things out with me. So maybe my school needs more groups, opposed to eliminated them!"""

If their \disability\"" can be broken down and specifically identified, then appropriate accommodations/modifications can allow them to access math both from a problem solving point of view and from an aesthetic point of view.

0,I would like to create a classroom mentality throughout the year that will encourage students to share their ideas - even though there might be mistakes present - because we learn best from finding out why we are wrong and knowing what to do next time something similar arises. The most interesting discussion often takes place when we disagree or when mistakes are present in our thinking.

0,"I think you made a wise choice, taking into account the dynamics of the classroom actually.  We know as teachers, that every set of kids we get each year requires us to adapt and modify our teaching to what is most conducive to the learning environment.  Having taught kindergarten, challenging the high group was ALWAYS my biggest challenge because the range of where students are at in their learning process is so very wide in kindergarten."
0,"I think it helps people see that even the simplest things, like counting have multiple approaches, that are like and unalike in interesting ways.  It helps get away from the idea that math is about one right answer (in this case 10), and moves toward the idea that math is about multiple approaches.  It can help people feel like their contributions are interesting and important.  It could also be a good setting to develop good group discussion norms.  You also get to see how numbers are made up of other numbers, which leads into interesting things later.  (E.g. you can't do 15*12 = 15*10 + 15*2 without knowing that 12 can be broken into 10 and 2.  In this video an interesting thing we saw is that 10 = 4+3+2+1, which is part of a very interesting series (triangle numbers))."

0,"My school district is like a yo-yo. We used to track starting in 3rd grade and then someone (thank goodness) must have actually read the research similar to what is presented here and we folded the tracking and went to heterogeneous grouping (keeping all our own homeroom kids) for a few years. Now, it is back to tracking since it has been deemed important that 8th graders are able to take geometry if they want! The 8th grade need pushes back to everyone so we now need to start tracking again so we can, somewhere before middle school, get a group of the \smartest\"" kids to skip an entire grade so they are ready for geometry. The teachers from K-8 have made case after case as to why this is not good for children but it has fallen on deaf ears. My personal goal is to get all my \""grade level\"" (which is seen as the low group) students to understand they are every bit as capable as the others but it is really hard when they are given the fixed mind set messages over and over from everyone else. I am THRILLED that I have some good data to show them. I at least have science and research on my side now too!"""
0,This is a great idea! The 6th grade teacher at our school does the same thing. It gives you such a great insight into their disposition towards math.
0,I think the mathematical ideas can be integrated and will be retained better.  I also find that interspersing hands on discovery geometry constructions adds interest for many students who thrive on creativity.
0,I think this reinforces to students that we are more interested in the process than the answer. There was only one answer to this question but many interesting ways of arriving or seeing that answer.
0,"It is scary because of the effect it has on students. I teach pre-GED level in a community college setting in the CUNY system. Many of my students in my classes are products of a failed public school system. Thus many of my students walk into my classroom the first day with a huge dark shadow of failure dogging their every effort. I am new to teaching, about two years now. It is a second career for me; I was, in another life, an education program coordinator. So I have much to learn about teaching.And although my heart is in the right place it has been a struggle for me to try to help my students overcome this heavy belief that they are failures, especially when it comes to math. Recently I was talking to a new colleague who just joined our staff this year, but who has been teaching for awhile. She was talking about the difficulty of teaching to so many different levels of ability in our classrooms. And she is right. We do have students with such a variety of strengths and ability who come from so many different backgrounds. So it is a dilemma how to catch the attention and interest of all. But I was horrified to hear her say that she grouped her students, that she felt it was the best way to teach to all skill levels. While I know that I lose many students (we all do in these programs) for whatever reasons and few finish out the semester, I do know that by the end of the semester I can look around my classroom and see all students working together. Yes my lesson planning and teaching are always a work in progress and I have so much room for improvement, but I almost cry to think of the adults in her classes who are assigned to their group and subtly told, this is it for you, I am confirming your negative sense of your abilities. This and no higher. But until this course and the information on the brain research and mind-set for growth, formative teaching, I had no words to counter her oh so reasonable pronouncements. Now I have the language and the tools."
0,"Unfortunately, test scores will always be the end until they go away. Yes, there are high expectations, but I think the biggest contributing factor to valuing education is the uniqueness of the community...small island community, educated population, many options for schooling (private and international), philanthropic funding for the resources that the state doesn't cover (which isn't much these days). It isn't fair that success is location specific, although all locations can be successful. Again, I am sensing a turn of positive events, hopefully it won't be a slow process."
0,"I would like to incorporate math into my science classroom in a routine fashion so that children would have a lot of practice using math while also seeing it as a useful tool that helps them understand their world.  I think one of the most powerful experiences you can give a child in math is to have them see and predict patterns of any given phenomenon--like wind direction and temperature/precipitation. It's concrete and testable, and it can lead to further questions: applied mathematics. Inquiry questions: Does wind direction effect temperature?  How well can we predict the air temperature based on wind direction?"

0,"Differentiated instruction, where a teacher with four ability groups teaches four different ways is supposed to be the panacea versus four different teachers teaching to each group. Some how splitting a teacher's time is more effective. The sad but true result is that there are not improvements, and as stated by NEAP, even a decline in math skills. My satire: If differentiated instruction is so great, because we'd never want a student to be bored (since they should always be entertained; you'd think they were playing a video game of their choice or going to a concert), then why hasn't there been improvement? Why do all these dumb colleges and training schools have intro classes, upper level classes, and graduate classes? Shouldn't everyone in Remedial Science for Pre-GED Students be placed in Graduate Quantum Physics? The professors could just differentiate instruction.Obviously, most teachers realize that they can't split their time two ways, let alone five, so they teach down the middle. This does a disservice to everyone.As an aside, a very important aside, no one mentioned the most important variable: Students."

0,I believe as educators and parents we can counter these stereotypes by doing our best to remain positive both in our thoughts and what we relay to our young people regarding learning math. We have to stop passing on the messages that have been generating all these years in this country. When a learner doesn't understand one method of teaching it's time to try another such as manipulatives. It also seems that many people can remember the exact moment when they began to  dislike math and therefore just gave up. If we can show our children that we believe they can learn maybe they won't give up so quickly. As adults we have to be willing to respectfully answer questions that students pose.
0,"I was impressed by their use of mathematical language, decomposing, friendly numbers."
0,"I am primarily a science teacher and have effectively used inquiry based projects to teach many concepts in my classes.  It seems that one way to make math classes more 'real world' and inquiry based would be to merge class time with other subjects.  Science is the obvious example, but with the amount of data and resources available online, other subjects could work, too.  For example, a history lesson could prompt students to figure out what the current world population (or part of it, ex. Jews in Poland, native Americans in the states that were original 13 colonies) would be today if a major historical event had not happened (war, disease, colonization).  A language arts class could analyze linguistic data, and make graphs to analyze trends in word use over time.So, the question is, how do you suggest math teachers reach across departmental boundaries and work with teachers in other subjects to make math relevant to the rest of academic work and life?"

0,"I'm still not clear on the research.  Here in NJ the push is on to bring all schools up to adequacy -- which is often done by financially withholding from the more accomplished schools.  At best, this brings up the mean -- but what does it say to those top performing schools?  I worry about the same issue in the classroom.  While it's a shame to limit the learning of underaccomplished students through interactions with stronger students, I question the appropriateness of slowing down a strong student to enhance the opportunities of the younger."
0,"I agree with Sebastian Thurn everything is math and it is fundamentally based on digits, process and practice"
0,"I was surprised by the language the students used.   They spoke about decomposing problems, breaking down numbers, explaining their thoughts, listening to other students to get other ideas, using friendly numbers.  They also mentioned that mistakes help them out.   All of these ideas are what we want our upper level students to do.  So if students are learning these techniques in lower grades we should be able to continue that trend in middle and upper level classes."

0,"What caught me by surprise is the students ability to decide these approaches will be helpful in the future(4th grade).  Far too often I hear, \When will I use this\"" rather than \""This will be helpful...\"""""
0,"The students engaged in academic language, which is excellent. I wonder, however, what an interviewed student might say about this activity if he didn't like it? I just wonder what the criticism would be. I suppose that, while it is an excellent learning activity, not everyone will feel as positive as these boys did."
0,"Seriously to be using math language like decomposing at such a young age, to be confident when talking about their relationship with number is so refreshing, I hope their future math teachers take a lesson from their 'Nick' and encourage that enthusiasm throughout their academic careers."
0,"My students like to play stump the teacher. They give me math problems and try to stump me. If they stump me they win (always). Not only does it show that not everyone's perfect, but that we all make mistakes and it empowers them as students that it's okay to make mistakes, that's how we learn."
0,Sometimes parents and teachers also expose children to negative messages about math.
0,"In Ontario, our elementary teachers are generalists and whether one likes it or not, it is natural for bias and fear to creep into the way in which we interact with curriculum in front of our students. I'd love for my elementary faculty to go through this course and understand that their own negative views of mathematics get perpetuated in their actions, not just their words."
1,"What is \Algebra as a Math Game\"" or are you just saying you create games that incorporate algebra."""
1,"The new fad in our district (as others) is to group and re-group based on who is struggling with what ideas at the time... the assumption being that flexible and non-permanent grouping avoids the negatives of tracking. I'm not convinced, but am unsure. Can someone speak to the notions of RTI that are going around now, and how they fit into this research about the lost opportunities by grouping students by ability (short-term vs. long)?"
1,"I can draw and reason out the cubes, but the algebraic notation is far beyond my skill level working alone. I would like to participate in an exercise like this to see if I could contribute. I guess I have been in elementary math too long! I had to watch this video several times, and came away with the onion peeling theory that could be adapted  for my students and my understanding. It was very frustrating. I still do not have it all."
1,"Although I have great deal of sympathy with the idea of mixed ability teaching, I do feel that before any such system can be introduced, the onerous formal planning, assessment, record-keeping and administrative burdens that most teachers in the UK labour under needs to be reduced first. Mixed ability needs a great time for useful planning, which many teachers do not have."
1,"I am teaching the inclusive sections of alg 2 for the first time this year. A little nervous, but very exciting. Any suggestions?"
1,I answered a question in session 5 that requires peer review but it does not even show as a question that needs peer review?Also I was able to peer reviews up to a few weeks ago and now I can't do peer review anymore.  When will this be up and working?
1,Thought I had completed all 8 sessions last night - this morning went to check my progress and part 3 out of 8 and 4 out of 8 haven't registered and been progressed - PANIC !! these were surveys that took me ages because I wrote loads and loads of feedback on them - thought I followed the instruction okay - now doubting myself - can anybody help there help or confirm?????
1,Who are you and how will you learn this seventh grade year?
