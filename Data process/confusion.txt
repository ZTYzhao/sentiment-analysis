"Kids get negative messages about math from family and friends.  My mom told me that she couldn't do math, so that was probably why it was hard for me.  My dad, on the other hand, was great at math.  However, when I would ask him a question, he would try to explain it to me the way he worked through problems which was using a slide-rule.  I had never seen a slide-rule before, so was additionally stressed because I could not understand the tool he used!  Most of my friends had difficulty with math, so we would complain to each other about how awful it was."
"I work with students on a one to one basis, so I don't necessarily \group\"" my students in any group in particular. But all that said, I see the results of students feeling like they're dumb and stupid when it comes to math. I don't know where they've heard these messages, but I do hope that message in their head changes. I've noticed that if I expect more from students, if they are available, then they will rise to the occasion and work hard. I also find that if I expect too much, they won't even begin the class and refuse to do anything. "
"i think it's always interesting and intriguing to see others' thought process in a common subject, so in this dot problem it must have gotten students really engaged in the class... to see who thought the same way, who thought in a different way and what was that different way"
"Is anyone familiar with the Degross research on Integrated Math discussed on session 8 part 3? I'm familiar with the Farr study, which is listed as a reference in the reference section, but I don't see the Degrosss study in the references and also can't find anything about it on the Internet."
Ohhhh.  Mathematizing....
"I'm still not clear on the research.  Here in NJ the push is on to bring all schools up to adequacy -- which is often done by financially withholding from the more accomplished schools.  At best, this brings up the mean -- but what does it say to those top performing schools?  "
"I have tried to submit a document form of my response, but still nothing happens..."
A great resource for increasing the cognitive demand for math tasks is:
Sounds like you will be a great connection for me. I am always looking to connect online and expand my PLN. Any tried and true experiences that you suggest would be greatly appreciated! My twitter is <redacted> Cheers!
How long would it take to grade the peer assessments?
"We all need classes in positivity, keeping gender, race, etc. out of our #, what do you call this hash tag."
"I was thinking the same thing about time constraints and teaching for a growth mindset. Our district is presenting more problem-based activities, but I am still under the need to cover all that the common core requires for the year. I just do not know how to teach in this manner, and monitor each student individually with all of their unique approaches, and assess their current understanding. We were not trained how to do this and now we're being asked to shift our methods without any experience. It all sounds really great and I like the idea of changing the fixed mindset, but how?"
I am SO with you on that.  You are one of the first people to openly say in public this.  I as well am trying to figure this out.
I found that data really shocking too! I would love to see the source.
"I'm Brazilian, but I read very well in English, so it would be good that all videos have subtitles."
"I peer feedback 70 people, but it shows way over 5000 that still need to be graded.  I have asked how there is so many to be grade but no one has answered. I think people will have to grade a lot more than 3 before it will be caught up. One of my was graded, no feedback left just a 1 score"
"I agree that students of any age are afraid of making mistakes in math.  I taught sixth grade and now teach adults, and I see that fear in both age groups."
"To Dr. Jo ,   our school system might be interested in being part of your research. However, You would have to go through our Office of Accountability first for approval, according to what I found out. Our school system is <redacted><redacted><redacted><redacted> in Maryland and our Math cuuriculum person is <redacted> <redacted> ( he also took your class this summer). I can send you <redacted> email if you are interested at all it is:   <redacted><redacted>@<redacted>    Hope you are able to see this email>>>> thanks again"
I am studying to be a teacher and am guilty of falling into the trap of having a fixed mindset when told of the ability classification of the class. I agree that my expectations drop and I dont believe this is of benefit to the students. I fully understand and can appreciate the thoughts of many in trying to figure out how to turn school systems around and promote environments that support and foster growth mind sets. I hope I can be part of the change.
I've heard they are working on the progress data pages.  I too finished the survey and it shows as a 0/1.  Not letting it stress me .... I can always go back later if it's not fixed.
"This sounds like what I feel as well as many of my colleagues. The materials provided are not conducive to a growth mindset and with the larger class sizes and combination classes we are finding it difficult to move forward. Report cards and state testing hang over our heads also. This is overwhelming when thinking of only math, then I think, \Oh My!\"" I have many other subjects that need the same revamping! Extremely overwhelming! Which is why we are sitting here on our summer time off writing to each other! :)"""
how does the old grading system factor in
I also love how the students write their own name on the paper; taking ownership for their learning perhaps?
I have heard this story that the little boy was Thomas Edison and this was an actual occurance with his mom.
"I plan to add  \Be Persistent\"" to our list of School Guidelines in addition to \""Be Safe,\"" \""Be Kind,\"" \""Be Respectful.\""  I want to work with my students on wht that word means and what it looks like in our class."""
"I have graded more than my 3 on several of the sessions to help out with this. I'm sure some people just aren't going to do it because they are not here to complete it, but if those of us who are do more than our share, it should work out. "
I thought this was the easiest of the three problems because it is very easy to solve with two ratio tables. I really like using ratio tables with students because they allow some flexibility in solving while giving the student structure.
"Grouping is not done in my school and I find that this means the teacher must work rather hard to get to know the students to understand if they are ready to take on the challenging exercises. This becomes a problem if the class is large and the teacher does not have access to the students results from the previous year. I generally put out different sets of work for the students that they try and see if they can complete. In the process I get them to work in collaboration, they look at different ideas and come out and discuss the issues they have had in solving the problems."
"It would be nice to have the option to edit peer grading. I accidentally gave someone a 0 and hit submit,then had no way to go back and fix it. My comment clearly did not go with a 0, so hopefully whoever you are, you understand that I'm so sorry!"
I think that we were asked to describe our thinking process. You could have talked about how you visualized the problem to find the answer if that was what you did. I think Boaler wanted to leave it open ended and not lead people to visualize if that's not a strategy we would normally use on our own.
I really have had some good learning happen as students try thing on excel.
I love the ideas presented in this lesson. They validate what I've been wondering for the last few years. 
"She asks clarifying questions before writing on the board, writes what the student is saying and not what she thinks, and she has other students explain student work."
I'll be showing my classes the video from session 3.2 which discusses the link between mistakes and brain growth - followed by a class discussion on how we can respond to this information.
"On a positive note I taught a year 7 set 3 group last year. Because they were labelled  'MA1' they believed they were set 1. I never corrected their belief. They did very well in their end of year test, but I don't think that was entirely down to their group name."
"I reread one of my answers and would like to change a word but I see no edit option or anywhere to clarify what I meant. Next time I will reread many times before I submit, but is it too late now??"
They are not afraid to make mistakes is important to note.
"Once we hit middle school and highschool, all students had private tutors to compensate for indifferent teachers. I hadn't. I was falling behind more and more and no teacher cared to see why an A student in all other subjects had a problem with math. Total indifference..."
I have always had the notion that there is more than one way to get an answer to an equation.  But never imagined the multiple ways one could picture 10 from the dot card.  This really shows that we can all be different in our thinking and still get the correct answer.
Growing up I knew from early on that teachers didn't think I was good at math. As early as third grade when times tables came around and I couldn't pass them as quickly it became apparent that I was going to struggle. I don't remember my parents helping me with math. My sixth grade teacher told me I would never be good at math because I didn't understand geometry. From that point on I did the minimum I could to complete grad requirements in math.
I agree with your statement that early tracking is detrimental.  I would hate to see it before 6th grade and there needs to be flexibility.  Our school allows students to move up to a higher level if they do well (or if their parents really insist).  We also have students go to summer school so they can move up to a higher level.
"I like the clean format in the video. Although this is not a comment related to the course directly, I am wondering what you used to make the intro graphic and how you set up the captions to go along with your talk. That might really help me as I work with my students online."
I agree with that. There are 40 red squares around the big square by knowing perimeter we need to add all the sides of the square.
Like.. a lot. Thanks.
"There are obviously many students who feel that they are placed or forced into a particular stereotype for math achievement. Unfortunately, I believe that they may be right. I have myself often heard of the myth that all Asians are good at math. If we are to correct this widespread epidemic of math failure or inadequacy, then we must learn to put aside our personal judgments and meet all children exactly where they are in an effort to overcome the stigma of so many myths holding our students back in the area of math."
"As a Canadian, I am surprised that Algebra is a separate course. We have it integrated into our math courses."
I do number talks in first grade also and they love it.  Even the ones that aren't confident will share their thinking.
"I feel it has always been portrayed not only that boys are better at math than girls, but that they also like it and girls don't. As a child I was told by my mother how she didn't do well in math/not like it, and if I had math problems, I was instructed to discuss it with my father. In my family, my brother seemed to understand math easier than my older sister, so I kind of assumed I also wouldn't understand math."
I am discouraged calculators unless the math really needed it or the child was taking math at the community college and calculators were required (college algebra or pre-calc level).
I agree with you. They hear some kind of discouraging remarks which undermines their potential effort.
It might be helpful to do a numbertalk with 7 x 8. How many ways could you do it?
"I see it as a growing pattern.  Each set adds one, then another one is added on the side.  Maybe I'm influenced by our systems Standard of Learning: Growing Patterns."
"i think they get it from their own learning experience. They could not \visualise\"" math in a way that it made sense to them as other subjects did.  Math may have been taught out of context."""
"I think the title says it all - I never thought that I would be in this situation: having to think of math interventions for my own son, going into Grade 11. "
"Negative messages regarding math are permeating our culture, our schools and our science community.  There are many studies on language learning and reading disabilities but only a fraction of funds has been allocated to math learning research and math learning difficulties.  Most learning specialists focus on language/reading, and there are hardly any professionals working on the math side.  The signal that is sent:  It's a lost cause or there is no cure."
Glad to see someone asked about women!!!! I wonder if I could adjust my usual Biography Projects and have the kids find information about someone they want to research and have them analyze if the person had a fixed mindset or a growth mindset.
It was clear that students had been taught to use terms like friendly numbers and decomposing numbers. I enjoyed listening them refer to math as free. They felt better prepared for future grades. I was curious why these particular students were chosen. Did they volunteer? Did the teacher suggest them? They were very verbose. I was sorry to see that there were no girls in that group.
I broke 18 into 10 + 8. Then I used the distributive property in my head: 5x10=50 & 5x8=40. I then added 50+40 = 90.
"Closed Add 3 apples, 2 oranges and 1 banana. How many pieces of fruit do you have all together?"
"And of course I just found someone a little further down that said www.Brainology.org, not com, works, too."

"Jo takes 3 hours on her own, help from Sam as well means it will take less time with them both working on it.   Once we know that between them they do 8/15 of the house per hour, the problem then is \how many hours to do the full house?\"" Or \""how many 8/15 are there in a whole one?\"" Or \""1 divided by 8/15\"".  Think/look back to Cathy doing \""1 divided by 2/3\"" a few sessions ago and you will see why this is the same as 15/8.  It might take you a while as your math brain is growing, but it doesn't mean you don't have one!  You're still learning, like the rest of us."""
"and if we can't understand the world around us, at least we have a common language to describe what we see and experience"
It might help to just write it out as well: (8/15)(15/8) = 1. She chose what to multiply by wisely.
"Everywhere you go you see and hear people talking about how hard math is.  They impart the message through words, attitudes and behaviors.  Families use the excuse that they are not good with math to allow students to do poorly. "

"\I still have concerns regarding time though as I am currently facing a reduction of face to face time in my courses but still have to cover the same curriculum.\""  "
"I teach the 7-3's at my school which is the 'lo' math students.  I am usually very glad they are not mixed in with the 'regular' math students so I can work on their special needs.  Before I teach equations with fractions, I spend a day reviewing adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing fractions which I don't do in my other classes.  I understand the whole mindset thing and agree with it, I just don't know how to teach different levels in the same class.  I am hoping they will be addressing this issue in the future lessons."

There were actually two things that surprised me about their feelings toward math.
"As a teacher I always have had the occasion to see that my students are helped at their Math homework by their fathers and at Romanian language homework, for example, by their mothers. This is the same sterotype that boys (fathers) are good at Math and girls (mothers) are not. The kids grow up with this idea in their mind and is very difficult to change it when they are older."
I like that quote! Im going to think about a Dutch translation of it. Thanks.
"Oh thank you! I am going to blow up poster size a brain picture and make a giant puzzle. At first I was thinking when we learn a task that was a goal, we will add a piece to the puzzle. But now I like the focusing well, working hard, showing persistence, positively reflecting on mistake. Now, where in my home can we build this?"
"Parents have passively said, \as long as you've tried your best.\"""""
I have the same thing.  In another discussion area in said that progress was not functioning properly yet.  So I am trying not to pay attention to the fact that it says that I am not done with session 1.
"after clicking the link to the lesson, scroll down to RESOURCES and click the first link to get the whole lesson which provides the info you're asking for.  But I  had to scan/ read the whole thing first, and look at the solution before I figured things out to begin answering the questions."
Your mathematical successes as an 11 year old will determine your mathematical successes later in life
I think groups with the most prescribed expectations are most likely to have a fixed mindset as they try to meet the fixed expectations set for them.  White males have traditionally been able to explore different paths in life.
"It was so wonderful to hear those boys talk about their perception.  Sadly, most students do not thing that math is free, much less cool!  I wish more students would describe math in that way."
"Is there anyway to communicate what you are learning in an informational way?  * Small emails with \look at what we are learning\"" or links to resources that will help your teaching or interesting research studies?  * Suggest to him/her that the teachers attending each present 1-3 key things they have learned (in a department meeting) that you'd like to discuss as a group * Encourage him/her to sign up because it is so interesting and you are learning so much about recent research in the field"""
"When my son was a teenager we began to incorporate the word \yet\"" when we noticed, for example, that he had yet to take out the trash cans.  It was very powerful.  Our much younger daughter picked it up on her own and uses it to this day.  I frequently rephrase students' (and my children's) comments using the word yet to make the comments more positive.  If you also start using \""yet\"" at other times (e.g., \""some students have yet to turn in their homework\""), the students will pick up on it.  In fact, I use it on myself: I have yet to finish this class.  But I'm going to!"""
I think in the first problem you changed the names (who's Ben and Grace?)  
"Teaching students the way they will be tested is a research-based principle. Kudos to you! Study guides with procedures? Not everything has to be a problem-based learning. Indeed, much research suggests that problem-based learning works better if a student has background knowledge. Notice, no where did I say that the problem-based learning needs to be exactly like the procedures already taught. By giving students a path, they can be prepared to think deeper and in a different way. Also, repeated attempts at the same procedures in novel concepts increases memorization and understanding. "
"Hi. I'm not a teacher but a learner, an adult one; someone who has always struggled with math even though I pulled down A's and B's during my high school career. I had (male) teachers who told me that girls were naturally less good at math than boys, and while at the time I resented and sought to overcome that stereotype I also think I internalized it to some extent. I was in fact so intimidated by math that I avoided it at all costs in college (which I was largely able to do because of a major that only required econ and statistics). Anyway, many years later I am now at a place in my life where I no longer have external performance pressure regarding math, and I'm ready to engage with it again. I am hoping that this class will give me new ways to understand old math concepts and empower me to tackle subjects like trig and calculus on my own terms."
"Is your brain sparking?  We have begun to talk about what happens when your brain is alive and growing, and the role of mistakes in this process.  It has served as a wake-up call for someone who has not been engaged."

I believe there was a questions about puzzles on the previous slide before this video was actually shown.
"It seems that often people have negative experiences with from a young formidable age and then have a hard to w moving beyond those. Things such as 1) math is just applying a bunch of memorized formulas. 2) math is a fairy tale land with a major disconnect to the real world, the story problems are unrealistic or impractical. 3) women have in general a negative self perspective of their math abilities a those seem to be reinforced via experience in classrooms."
"I also agree with mathteacher24's comment. A lot of teachers (I am guilty of this myself at times) may teach math the way they are taught, practice and procedure over concept building."
"I think the problem is not only the methods of teaching, it is also the study programs, all contents are also the problem."
"I think that is part of why I struggled with math as a student, I am a visual learner and math was never really presented that way.  It was all numbers..."
I once read a commentary in a newspaper about an article about Algebra for all in 8th grade.  The person said expecting everyone to be ready at the same age is like expecting all boys voices to change at the exact same age.
"I had encountered several parents and students who had expressed their deep-seated belief that the ability to learn math is hereditary and fixed.  All stakeholders in education need to be informed of research showing brains' ability to continually change throughout life.  Educators and parents should not use fixed ability view to deprive some students of challenging and enriching opportunities to learn math, and students should not be allowed to use fixed ability view to excuse themselves from trying."
"Students receive negative messages about doing mathematics from their parents and siblings, from friends and occasionally from teachers or professors."
"Do all the students work on the same problem or do they have a choice.  How do you ensure they learn to a broad level as is required by the curriculum.  I know this sounds structured but where do we get really interesting problems from?  They are not all interested in, how much will it cost to redecorate my bedroom?...  I love the idea of PBL but am not sure how to implement it."

I teach special education students in a resource setting that by its nature is grouping. What I do for those students who successfully complete tasks in advance of others is that I have them help another student. In this way they feel good about themselves while the other student gets additional attention.
"Yes, the parent and teacher do have an important role as an encouraging mentor who continues to learn when to step in and when to step back."
"The PP students obviously has the self-confidence and fortitude to go into an exam situation knowing they will do the problems as they are presented to them. the AH students need some type of \security blanket\"" (the \""triggers\"") to get through the exam. They have no self-confidence that they can do the problems on their own."""
"\Math is free\"" was the most surprising comment, but it made sense. I liked how the middle boy clarified at one point, \""You can do what you want to get the right answer!\"" There is a tendency in the public debate to dichotomize math teaching: either you focus on process and don't worry about \""right answers\"" or you teach how to get the right answer without regard to each student's process. That is a false dichotomy."""
Sarah's parents presented Sarah with mathematical games that sparked her interest and love of math. Also she is very articulate which she stress is an important skill to have.
Many different ways to deal with a natural number as sum of smaller natural numbers
I had to do this in several sittings and expand my thinking beyond the 4 basic operations.  I posted by answers earlier.
"In addition, sometimes the elementary teachers provide poor or downright wrong instruction. I can tell which of my high school students had a particular elementray teacher in 5th grade by their consistent mistakes."
"I am not surprised by the research.  I, too, try to challenge all of my students but need more help in differentiation and keeping it organized.  I have yet to see a model of flexible grouping where the teacher doesn't spend hours each week. If we are to use homogeneous groupings then I have a lot of questions.  Specifically, how do you move the students from one group to the other, how does the teacher keep track of the individual needs and then group the students, what is an organized way that will not take hours every week to redo the groups, etc.?  How do we convince administrators of this type of grouping? However, my biggest concern with this is that one or two students from the group end up doing most of the work.  So I would need to see this in action to see how the teacher monitors and makes sure that all students have a growth mind set."
I agree.  I did exactly the same thing!
"I have never heard of this before.  Watching the lesson, I saw a language rich environment, although completely orchestrated by the teacher, many students were involved. I liked that the problem wasn't written down but just demonstrated with a picture that could be seen in different ways.  It was very algebraic.  I would like to see more examples of this.  Anyone know of a number resource for high school number talks?"
Do you happen to teach at SRV? I graduated from there in '05.
Thanks for the help on 13.
"I can see how topics are introduced, similar to the video we watched of the teacher presenting a fraction lesson. I'm not clear where it goes from there though. Once the number talk happens and the kids seem to be clear on the concept, do you then use the more familiar methods of assigning problems for them to complete and eventually testing them on the topic? I would like to see the daily plan that was followed by the summer school class so I can get an idea of how these methods play out over the weeks and months."
Our limitations as parents often carry forward in our expectations of our children
I figured out the first two without much difficulty and I am still ruminating on the 3rd!
Is identifying yourself as a growth mindset fixed?
"Females in the US culture seem to be encouraged to develop language skills and to use verbal communication to connect with the world. Listening to these clips, I had the realization that in math classrooms that fail to utilize discussion, girls may feel ignored. It doesn't impact the boys because they aren't cultured to use conversation as their mode of connection. Hum, wonder if that is true?"
We agree with your points but we both felt that the lectures are rather long-winded. Can they be more succinct?
That is exactly what I did. Now why I did that I do not know because for me there was not enough info to go further so I figured it had to be an addition issue.
"If I had the opportunity to influence policy, I would require that students choose one course each year that they anticipate will be a challenge for them, and allow them to take it without being graded.  "
May I make a suggestion to the progress on 'peer review' questions?  
"Yes, exactly what I was going to say... B because of A."
"I love to use a version of this quote, as well."
"Where I live students are put into maths sets in about the second or third year of primary school.  I work in a high school as a teaching assistant and am this year working with my daughter's peers who I have known since they were 4 years old.  The ones that were labelled as low ability in primary school are still in bottom sets with little hope, in their eyes and their parents (and some teachers), of ever achieving much, and so they don't want to try because 'I'm crap at maths Miss, always have been'. Some top set students don't think they should be there because they have a perception that they're not as clever as their classmates.  All in all, rather depressing, and maths classes have some of the worst behaviour issues in the school."
I thought 10+10 for the vertical sides but then knowing that the top and bottom each shared two blocks with the vertical sides would then be 8+8 meaning or 40-4 which is 36.
How do you make it?
"The area of the slice should be the same, but the format can be anyone, since they are the same size."
"My school heavily tracks students and I teach the \lower\"" sections of Algebra 1.  At the beginning of this year we needed to move students to balance teacher-student ratios and the counselor said she was going to base her decisions off test scores.  I continually see students that are extremely bright and shouldn't be in the lower class, yet every year they are.  I see more challenges in motivating them because I cannot point out as many great peer successes.  This is very evident when it comes to discussions when having just one more \""higher\"" student could be the linchpin to creating a great discussion.  As a teacher I feel like I have very little control over who I teach, but I know that by mixing students everyone would learn much more."""
We have always grouped our children according to their ability so this is really questioning the way i teach maths.  However our children don't stay in those groups.  Through formative assessment they are moving groups all the time (hopefully).  They are also grouped differently according to the strand of maths we are teaching and their strengths at the beginning of these lessons.  We also use flexible groupings so a child can be in 2 groups.  One at their ability and then the next one up to extend their thinking. Also when they are solving a problem they have a variety of materials to use to help them solve it their way and they get to share this.
"Hi, "
I see this all the time at my school.

"I think some negative messages come from within the child.  Math involves thinking and it is easier to say, \I don't get it.  Or it is too hard\"" than to focus on question."""
Both A & B - with A as a causal factor for B.
Typically I went for the 25% is a quarter so it's 50. But I know from teaching a lot of students percentages the most popular is 10% is 20 double it to find 20% = 40 and half of 10% is 10 so 40 + 10 = 50
Our school has also used some of their budget to set up intervention groups and I would love to know how this time could still be used but used to develop growth mindset so that it would be easier for the skills to develop as well???
"Could it also be that the teaching methods help create the lack of foundational knowledge because of the emphasis on getting the correct answer on \the test\"".  One method is to teach concepts and another method is to teach how to get the \""right answer\"" on \""the test\""."""
I also am in WA. Where do you teach?
Go to Progress and look below the bar graph.  You will see questions for each session and they will have 0/1 or 1/1.  The 0/1 are ones waiting to be graded by peers and you will not get credit for these until they are graded.  The 1/1 are the ones you self-graded.  I finished session 4 last Monday and I am still waiting for my session 1 questions to be peer graded.
"I'm curious about what people have experienced for 'borderline' placements.  I have have mixed results, but mostly, borderline students have really suffered in my advanced classes.  I think the problem is time demands.  There is not enough time to do the extra work required to take the harder courses."
I just watched it and I honestly did not see where the guys dominated the room or where the teacher showed favoritism.

I also wonder if students would reframe feedback they get through the year as being supportive rather than just tearing them down.
I teach the same lesson to all the students that come back to me in small groups.  I differentiate the lesson from that point.
"A colleague of mine in India told me that her students automatically felt less close to her/able to approach her as compared to English and computer teachers because as a math teacher, we are always telling them that something is \wrong\"" and bombarding them with difficult things that they do not like and often struggle to understand."

So true.

"I don't have a class yet, but I'm pursuing certification to teach secondary math.  I think I'll probably want to begin each class each year with a discussion about what mistakes mean (Ideally, it means that they're working in the Zone of Proximal Development.), how they can be used effectively (as opportunities to ask themselves: What did I do wrong here?  What did I misunderstand?  How could I have avoided this mistake this time?  Have I made this type of mistake before?  Is it similar to other mistakes I have made?  What can I do to keep from making it again?), and - as was discussed in this video - why faster isn't necessarily better (Quick responses mean you may not have thought deeply about this particular question or subject.)."

I wanted to make sure that I was giving thoughtful answers, but since people really need their stuff reviewed, maybe we should just review with \yes I agree, nice idea\""?"""
Good for you.  I am determined to solve it too.
"It's so difficult to accept the research when I have personal experiences of being pulled out of class for math help.  And as my mother would say, \Look, I turned out fine!\"" Would I have turned out to be a genius at math if I had been left in class to work with other students?"""
"Through second grade at my school, children are not grouped by ability. There clearly are children that have had greater exposure and experience with math. Frequently mixing these children in small groups or partnerships with those who have had less experience raises everyone's confidence and comfort with math. Even without tracking per se, I do see the dangers of teacher expectations played out over the years. In transition meetings, as kids move to the next grade level, they are labeled as high or low, and along with that goes the phrase \he'll really need some challenging math.\"" Makes me wonder, doesn't everyone? Clearly they do!"""

"In my school district and in many across the state, it is against district policy to track students. We have mixed group classes. However, with RtI (Response to Intervention) we are creating classes that will help students that have some need or additional support. These classes can be quite challenging because within an intervention class, many of the students will have different needs. What I have found is mathematically, these students are all at the same relative level. Therefore, I still see tracking happening within the district, but because it is called something different, it is alright to group these students together. This is the second year we are running this program, and we have seen great improvement in the group of students that have been identified in needing additional support. In fact, we have been so successful in seeing these students in a mixed class with an additional support class that we are now offering a year 2 class for math support."

"The self esteem issue often comes across as \social promotion.\""  The issue here (Ontario, Canada) is that our elementary students have no real option for progressing forward in an English class but repeating or changing stream in a Math class.  It is either move along or repeat the whole grade.   The social promotion debate focuses on the damage that may be done if they repeat.  To me, it seems that if options A and B are problematic, we need an option C."""
"I've heard that not placing upper grade students in the correct ability grouping is because of their behavior in the classroom.

What is your opinion of math: do you want to change that opinion and why?
I think we gain insight into our own thinking and perspective.  It explicitly can reveal how our mind tends to work.  It also broadens our mind to see things differently and have another perspective we may not have considered.
I think the dot card problem is a great entry into number talks because it provides access to multiple groups while also showing just how differently everyone thinks about math. It also allows for extension when you ask about patterns that students see between methods.

How pleasant to hear the affection these boys have for math. All three of them enjoyed talking about why they like math and recognized that their love of it came from their use of it in a classroom where mistakes are not discouraged but used caringly to illustrate what can go wrong.

"From parents at home, from their peers and even teachers at school."
Has anyone noticed how stereotypes in math are not so overt?  It can be something as simple as deferring to a particular student in a group or inadvertently picking the same batch of students to answer questions?  The problem is that is it difficult to speak up in class if you are afraid to answer.  So status quo remains and the me students run with it while others lose their self-esteem in the subject.

"In the Second grade classroom I student taught in, the teacher chose to use the Accelerated Math computer program with her students.  She also used Accelerated Reading.  I thought these programs were great for the simple fact that the students were on an individual track of growth.  The teacher can assign each student his/her own set of learning standards.  They test themselves, have the computer scan their cards.  If they have mastered that standard, they move onto new ones.  My teacher would teach group lessons and refresher lessons for new standards for the class, but they could get to them in their own pace.  They can get a print out of all the standards they have mastered.  The students were so comfortable w/ this system.  And since all of their worksheets were different, but looked similar, they didn't have a clue where their fellow students might \be\"" as are as level."""

"We use Teacher's College's Reader's and Writer's workshop model in our school.

When I started to teach math this year, I spread this theory out and referred to all my first graders as \""mathematicians.\"" I also make mistakes myself while teaching so if a student does make a mistake they do not lose confidence but know that even one who loves and teaches math can make mistakes too. It is all about confidence."""

Edutopia.org contains many resources about project based learning. My school is going 1:1 Ipads for all 8-12 students for next school year.  In conjunction each teacher is creating two PBL's for the upcoming school year. One will be implemented in the fall and the second in the spring.  We will then add another two projects the following school year. I am spending lots of hours on the internet searching for ideas that I think I can carry out with my class. It is an exciting prospect and one that certainly fits in with what we have learned so far in this class.
Teaching method & algebra itself is hard (the thinking behind requires abstract mind searching)

I should have made it explicit about the collective responsibility and formative approach - Thanks for your positive comments.
"Last year at our school there was some buzz about Mass Customized Learning; some teachers were very excited about the concept and others quickly picked up anything they could find on the topic. I put it on the back burner as I simply could not take on one more thing our district was piling on. In the past month I had an opportunity to speak to two middle school students (from a different district) whose district had adopted this new concept. To me it sounds like a great way to open up the flood gates on learning, allowing students the freedom to create and share their understandings about topics such as math. However, for these girls, they felt lost and uncertain as to where to turn. They said \if we don't know what we don't know, how do we know how to access the information\""? Not sure if this is on topic, but just something I started think about after listening to this last session."""
"I was just double-checking after Jo asked us to be sure to complete the survey. I completed it shortly after Session 8 was made available. Actually, I did it twice.The progress section doesn't show that I did the survey. I will do it again; I don't know if it will be a duplicate if the first one was, in fact, recognized."
Where is the statement of accomplishment?
"I think that parents who have succeeded without using math may give the message that it is not necessary to learn.  Celebrity role-models seem to exemplify vocal talent, physical appeal or physical prowess rather than challenging their mental acumen. I am not sure that there are negative messages or just the absence of math messages.  I seems that card and board games that used to teach math skills have been replaced with computer games that calculate the player's score without thought.  Technology seems to have replaced math analysis.  It is almost laughable that in a society that revels in financial success, most people don't know financial (math) principles."
"Although I am not surprised math is a traumatic experience for most and many, I am surprised an individual who has chosen a math based career had such a horrible memory of the math experience. I believe I have always been talented at math. I believe I'm a logical, problem solver. I don't know if that is just a natural talent or part of the influence of my engineering father who supported my math education. My father instilled in me I should never be content with not knowing the answer to a question. I attempt to implant this same idea in my students, making math a exploration and a journey but I will say I sometimes feel my students don't have the same desire to be aware of their math surroundings the way I am. They seem disinterested and site their   lives are different  then the math questions we pose - because they use debt cards they don't feel engaged by a change question. Because the make choice based on brands and status, comparing products in order to find the \best deal\"" isn't of interest.

"Same issue here, have been waiting for work to be graded. It seems that it should be corrected such that if a response is submitted then the item should be complete for the purposes of the \progress\"" scale."""
I think that you could also role model for them on how to take advantage and learn form mistakes. Or think of previous experiences where they succeeded because first they made mistakes and had to persevere until they got it right.
"What you say is correct. First, teachers should be retrained. Who will do this?"
"I think first being a female who loves math and is good at it helps. Often I think that is goes a long way. It's almost a wait a minute, miss is good at math. She shouldn't be. I think in my room they have seen the evolution of some during math and I think they wouldn't say girls or boys are better."
"I think a tendency in countering stereotypes is to overcompensate. I've interacted with my own children about their perception of stereotypes in math.  In fact, their experience is quite different from what is portrayed in the class thus far.  Both my high school daughter and junior high son perceive that girls are better in math than boys.  That is just as damaging as the reverse."
same thing happening to me!  I would also like to earn the credit.  Please advise.
"Watching this video reminds me of how different each individual student is, and that they all learn in different ways. Methods that work for one student do not necessarily work for another student, and it is important to reflect on this. I think it's important for students to reflect on this as well, and it could be worthwhile to do a basic number talk even in a high school classroom to re-emphasize to students that it's okay to have a different solution than their neighbour."
It surprises me how many of my colleagues don't have basic math skills and yet are teaching math.

"I agree with your comment about there not being only one \right way\"" to answer the question.  That is such a great thing because then this is a low stress, anyone can contribute activity.  It engages all learners and expands their view of math as not just one-way and dull, but really creative and fun.  Hopefully the teacher can continue on with the lesson being creative not just formulas and rules."""
I was stuck on these too until I thought of sqrt4 and 4!

"I am an educator.  During parent teacher conferences when discussing a student's work in math parents will reply, \Well I was never good at math.\""  This is often said in front of their children.  I think this is damaging because it sends the message that its ok if their children are not good at math."""

Love the statement!
The boys really like math and feel that Nick taught them an easier way to solve the problems. They felt that they could transfer this skill to other problems. It gave them a lot of confidence. They say that they are comfortable making mistakes in math talks.
I agree with <redacted>.  It may
I too think  we over testing . The students need time to understand the material given and reflect on it.
I have heard the messages in the video but i also know people i.e. my sister that just never liked Math not because of anything but just because. I felt the same way about Biology just never liked it no particular reason at all the moment i could no longer required to take it i stopped gladly
"Students are all unique; some process a little more slowly-they process well, just at a different pace.  But many classes do not differentiate for different learners but move everyone along at a pretty fast pace, leaving many behind.  Also, methods are far too often geared to strong auditory learners with lots of teacher talk and not many opportunities to experience and play with concepts to develop a comfort level with them."
Exactly the same for me  - obviously some can do peer review - maybe they are on a different server  - I get the message when going in to do peer review that there is a problem - since Tuesday when I did 5.5 - emailed support but no reply as of yet
Great decisions by the teacher.
I wish that I found your posting hard to believe!
I am also looking for new ideas to help students understand the different areas of math.

How do you use this information to move them to 1? I think the idea.
interesting you mention the selection of three boys. I too was curious as to why all boys? I wonder if there is a video of three girls coming up next!
"I liked hearing the students say making a mistake is okay, because others in the class can help you. Plus, they were able to reflect on their past experiences and how what they were learning will help them going forward. They also mentioned applying what they learned outside of the math talk. This was not a skill to be used only in certain instances but anytime."
"I think it is exciting for students to see so many different methods.  We assume others think the same way that we do.  When we find out that they don't, it's a mind boggler.  It opens our minds to all of the different ways things can be seen."
"What surprised me the most was that these students knew it was the teaching method that made the difference.  They were able to compare how they learned math before, and this new way of looking at it, and how the new way would help the going forward."

What resources (books, online courses/tutorials) are there, that a self-learner can use, that abide by the concepts taught in this course? I'm willing to start from elementary math to build a good foundation, so I welcome any and all resources! =)"
"No original thought here, mostly A. I was taught to memorize rules and did so. I got \good\"" grades but never understood what was going on. It was in college that I had my first \""aha\"" moment in math, with the help of an outstanding teacher. I think young students give up early on the idea that math is supposed to be UNDERSTOOD. TO MAKE SENSE. Instead, they accept that they must memorize things, and eventually lose all contact with the idea that they are really supposed to comprehend the concepts. By the time I get them in middle school, even the \""good\"" students just want to know the steps they have to do to solve a problem. The idea of thinking about it creatively and solving it using intuition and skills is completely foreign to them. We have made them that way."
No goal that was worth reaching was made without effort and struggle.
"Competency-based education in NH is becoming very popular. I wish there were more resources around grading, communication and pathways shared with the world."
Thanks Cheryl!
I am interested to know that as well!
Sef- thanks for replying. Just found it!
Will you be able to log in and re-watch any of these videos after the closing date of the class or will the course videos and content no longer be accessible after this week?
So true! It's something I hadn't thought about - helping them learn how to approach problems and not give up is just as important as the math skills themselves. Critical and creative thinking is so important in this subject and we must be deliberate in teaching it.
"Thank you! Didn't know the progress button was troubling to others as well. I tried submitting the survey 3 times, still did not show up. I am reassured I have done every I should have now. Thanks again!"
Reading the blog post http://fawnnguyen.com/2013/05/07/<phoneRedac>6.aspx was quite interesting.  I know that how you ask a question changes the level and thinking required to solve a problem.  This really illustrated the correct way to present a question to make it more open ended and to make more sense to the children.  I want to ask better questions this year that involve that higher level of thinking.
"Hi everyone! I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Hamilton, ON (which is near Toronto). I teach grade 8 and am also the math leader for my middle school. I am looking forward to learning with all of you!"
"I think many students (and adults!) can be helped by visualizing mathematics, but most have a tendency to see things in one particular way, from a particular vantage point so to speak. By doing number talks we gain the advantage of hearing/seeing how others visualize mathematics thus we can begin to change our own perspective."
"By listening to a student's reasoning, I have sometimes found that they have found an alternative correct answer to a problem.  Putting the focus on the process and thinking takes away from emphasizing only a correct solution. I agree with Ellie that having a student walk through his/her solution process often allows them to find and correct their own answer."
"One year I had two wonderful classes of 6th graders. I had to decide which students would go to the high or low class in 7th grade. Well, I found that I wanted 28 students in the high class, and only 12 in the lower class. My principal was mad at me as well as a few others who would have to have a large study hall of 28. I was told my decision was ridiculous to have the classes split like that. I was shocked at people's reaction. I said to some of the upset ones, \What if it were your son or daughter who belonged in the higher class, but because of numbers your child were put in the lower class?\""  No one would answer. I finally got my way, but there were grade restrictions put on them. If any one got a C in the higher class they would have to be moved. (I tell you, I worked so hard with some of those border line kids trying to be sure they did not get a C. I did lose one, but the rest did great and all moved on to the next level.) "
I too am interested in how you allow kids to work at their own pace. I have no student technology in my classroom and we very rarely use a textbook.
Start slowly.  It takes one month for a teacher to implement one idea. Six months for it to become more of a habit enabling it to be evaluated.
"Students in our school are assessed in the subjects of literacy and math by the quarter.  We report the scores for these assessments to the district.  Students are then identified as challenge (above level), benchmark (at level), strategic (approaching level), intensive (below level).  We look the scores at grade level meetings and try to determine what we did to to bring students to challenge and benchmark, and try to figure out what we can do to bring strategic students to benchmark or challenge.  We look at intensive students and try to figure out what we can do to bring raise them to another group.  I am not saying that this is an effective or an appropriate way to look at students or plan instruction.  I am thinking that there is a better use of our time.  Our time could be used to think of challenging problems, ways to scaffold so that all students have access or entry points to the problem, and create opportunities for students to make mistakes and work through their mistakes with teacher feedback and in collaborative groups.  I am continuing to think this through."
"The first dimension (how does the shape grow?) offers more space for observation, thinking, describing and inquiring. The second dimension (how many cubes in case 100?)puts us in a more matter of fact, \where is the formula\"" type of thinking."""
"At our sight students are placed into honors, AP, and regular classes. The failure rate is all time high  amongst the students. Is it due to this segregation?"
It wasn't because she learned better because she was a girl and I was just a slow learning Jock. We were both straight A students throughout school. We were just subject to two different teaching methods miles apart.
I was able to solve the ratio problem.  The turkey problem I was not exact enough with my answer and I used too much detail to answer the house painting problem.  It is hard to know how much detail to use when the rpoblems are presented out of context.
"When you view some of the later sessions you will see why tracking is not needed. When the questions are problems of exploration, and problems can be solved in so many different ways, all students are able to contribute, learn and extend their thinking as far as their intellectual abilities will allow. All students contribute. All students extend their thinking, learning and understanding."

"I am a teacher that advocates for students and parents. During the end of the year conference a critical discussion to students is, \You need to continue to advocate for yourself. If something isn't working find someone who will listen or come back to me\"". To parents, \""You need to continue to advocate for your child. If no one is listening, come back to me\""."""
*Peer observations (feeling stupid in front of others)
Has anyone else had trouble submitting the final survey. I've now filled it out twice and got a notification that it had been accepted. It still doesn't show up as being done a week later.
Thank you
I would tell students that making mistakes is okay and that the best way to learn is from our own mistakes.  I would also establish a safe learning environment in which every one is equal and that no one is perfect - making mistakes is proof of learning.
Parents and peers....then themselves.
Made me feel weak and stupid.
"I think I will talk about brain growth (and show them the research--I teach seniors in high school) when mistakes are made. That is a powerful learning tool, and I think my students will believe the research and therefore be willing to make mistakes publicly."
"As a high school teacher, I too am concerned about students who have passed previous courses and haven't retained the content.  I believe students are lacking foundational knowledge for a variety of reasons and we, as teachers, need to use better teaching methods so that they **will** remember what we have taught them."
"Sure they would be better off with tinker time, but with high stakes testing pushing us to cover x number of concepts, it's really hard to find that time. I wonder if we took more time for discovery would we spend less time with remediation?"
I'm old fashion and prefer to meet.
"Hi David, "
Students need modeling and practice to begin thinking about word problems.  The teacher should provide examples and verbally and visually go through the think/draw method.  This will take practice for both the teacher to change method of instruction and for the student to think about a problem and visualize the words.
How sad is it that this statement is ever said. I hope to change this when I become a teacher.
"I teach Kindergarten and they love the idea of growing their brain.  So if I teach them that making mistakes means their brain will grow, they will be more comfortable making them."
"Besides TV, kids get messages mostly from peers and parents.  Less so, from role models in real life and in videos, games, movies, etc."
A pencil when it is not used gets dull.
"Some people are better at math. My math tutor was doing math very easily and for me it took a lot of time and was very difficult. I know negative messages toward students regarding math does sometimes come from adults, but students are not stupid either. Students can see that \Jane\"" can get her math assignment done in 15 minutes and it takes over an hour for them to do the same lesson. No one told me I was bad at math-- I realized it myself, although I did not have any encouragement in that area either"""
"How will teachers model making mistakes, and what activities would you suggest to do with students in the first week to make it a norm to make mistakes and persist? Are there any funny exercises you would recommend students do together to make public the fun of mistakes?"
You rock SandraP05!!
- Invites those done early to think of it a new way
I think that the boys really felt a sense of pride and accomplishment in how they think about math and how they can tackle it!
I found in more interesting than surprising that the kids had fun and were so relaxed about doing and talking about math and how to use different ways to find answers. I did find it surprising that they knew they would be able to use their new found skill in other areas and that if they had not been exposed to the technique that they would have problems in subsequent grades.
"Too true. They don't realise how much damage it actually causes. Many do it with the best of intentions, reassure their kids when upset."
"Throughout my post-secondary education, people would always hate on the Asians. They would always throw 'you must be good at math because you are Asian' comments. This would happen directly and indirectly towards the individuals."
How frustrating to feel that everyone else had help and you didn't!
"I am going to stress the importance that math is not inherent, and that anyone can learn...and that specifically the way to learn math is through mistakes. I am also going to make it clear on Day 1 that if you're not making mistakes, you need to see me after class so I can apologize to you and give you work that will help your brain grow and develop!"
"When my sister and I were in school grK-12, our father was a high school math teacher. We were expected to be good in math (and science, mom was a biology teacher) and to \learn it the old-fashioned way\"" - watch daddy do it, practice what daddy did, [know how to] do it alone. Dad never asked us if it connected to anything else that made sense, if we had a different way of thinking about it or making sense of it or what we thought (and certainly not how we felt). When we made mistakes, it was not pleasant - we frequently heard \""why can't you do this, why did you get it wrong, you're not stupid, you must not have studied hard enough or practiced long enough!\"" My sister (who skipped 2 grades) would be in tears but I was a much more stubborn kid who didn't cry, already knew I wasn't stupid, and was lucky in memorizing procedures (I skipped 1 grade). Classroom instruction was no better - both of us experienced the pressure of quick and correct answers, and blackboard embarrassment. Sis developed ELA skills to become a writer, lawyer and executive; I became a teacher with a doctorate in math ed. I recently found out how profoundly negative and sustaining my sister's math learning experiences had been - despite her use of math to manage multimillion dollar corporate accounts in her career and personal portfolio accounts, she says \""I'm not good at math!\"" And when I'm feeling just a little mean, I know I can bring sis to tears if I invoke her memories of 11th grade math class drills. Needless to say I now know so much more about math, affect, and math learning and teaching - I imagine my dad and I would have very interesting conversations. Feedback to any math learner has a huge impact!"""
"Mistakes are like healthy food for your brain, they are an important part of learning. When mistakes are made in math I will have a place in the classroom where they can be recorded (maybe a goof chart or something) and hopefully kids will begin to feel good about making mistakes."
"Three students that like math, what about the other 17 to write a number. That is a little class, does not? Maybe it will be 20 good answers and positive experiences with friendly numbers, with freedom to calculate."
"I wonder if your stronger students wouldn't puch your weaker students, helping the weaker students.  Also, your stronger students would get a chance to explain their reasoning fully which will in turn deepen their understanding."
"The sad thing is that this shirt was probably being purchased by Mothers and Grandmothers, perpetuating the fixed mindset...and the purchasers would have thought that the shirts were cute."
The message does often start at home from parents and siblings.  Kids are told that is alright not be good at math and its o.k. not to try.  But it is also found in literature and written media. Cartoons often depict situations with people struggling with mathematics.  There was even at one point a talking Barbie that said she wasn't good at math.
I agree with making math real life. If we can show that math is in everything then it may help.
"I wanted to share this site with you.  It is produced by Dr. Cathy Brennan at MIT.  It is a series of short video biography's of various scientists that details how perseverance led them to become scientists.  It really highlights that it is all about curiousity and perseverance, not some innate skill."
"I understand that a number represents a quantity, regardless if the objects are closer together or far apart."
"Asians feel a lot of pressure from their family if they are average or below in math. Their parents put a lot of guilt on them, especially the new immigrants, saying that they left their country of origin to provide a better life to their kids & math is a big part of that!"
"I suppose we all have a method which feels more natural to us, and if it works, it can seem an annoyance to have to learn different ones! (Can you tell I have maths issues of my own! )"
"Unfortunately teachers often teach to the middle of any group, even heterogeneous. However, if you are prepared to cater for the range of abilities then absolutely, students who are strong in a particular area may not be strong in another."
"Dot Card is a quick way to help students capture geometry and visual imagery of patterns they see. It is great to allow students the VISUAL SPACE to see dots rather than numbers. When they are allowed to see dots in various formats, they are more likely to decompose the dots in varying images that is imprinted in their brains."
"I loved that they felt \free\"" to figure out how to work on a problem. \""Decompose?\"" I don't think many middle schoolers know what that means unless they're in science class. The ease with which they talked, explained the concept of friendly numbers, and were totally accepting of making mistakes -- fabulous!"""
"I agree.  Plus, it's amazing how a seemingly simple problem like adding up dots on a card can be viewed so many different ways, all correct.  It shows students (and teachers) that there's more than one valid way to approach a problem."
I tried this exercise with my classes today.  The kids loved it. Students who never speak up were sharing.  I was duly impressed.  Tomorrow I'm going to try it with a different configuration. Does anyone know if there are specific arrangements that make it easier or more difficult?  Are there a set of cards out there?  It was great to come home and watch the video again.  I like the way she extended the lesson by asking the students what similarities they saw.  There are some things I noticed tonight that I don't want to miss tomorrow when we work with another card.
"I agree with some of the posts I have read regarding ability grouping and tracking. We've known for a long time that students don't benefit from grouping by ability. Yes, parents are a challenge because they were most likely raised like us, in fixed mindset ability groupings. It is up to us to teach others in our building about how we should have heterogenous groups, not just in math but in all subjects. Teaching to strategies is helpful, meeting with individuals or small groups based on a strategy that they all need to work on. One way students can learn is though peer group work of the sort that we have seen in this course. We need to stand true to our convictions and help others, colleagues, principals, parents, see that by grouping students by ability we hurt them all."
"My 6th grade students get negative messages about math from their parents who \struggled\"" with math.  "
"Very good solution! I knew it was a series, but I couldn't find the right formula."
I made a table with it but have not watched Jo's explanation yet.
I have had the same issue tonight too.
Enlightening!  You learn the flexibility of math.  The creativity.  You learn new methods you can use.
"So far I have seen lots of references to issues in the UK schools, in American schools, etc.  I am curious your opinion, if you have one, on how we are doing in Ontario.   While we have some standardized testing, the burden is not so onerous as in the US, nor are teachers treated the way I hear about from news reports in the US in terms of firings over results, etc.   And some of our initiatives, like the model for math we are trying to fully implement, seems to fit with a lot of what I see in this course.  Any thoughts?"
"Some may take 50% of 200 = 100, then half of 100 = 50."
"I do believe that in younger age to put kids in ability group will set kids to failure. We need to challenge kids, but in high school, what we can do? If kids have poor basic math skill, how can we help them?"
"About the \Mistakes\"" that is an attitude I have been constructing to myself, in a more open way, as well as for my students, your words helped me to reflex on it and might even, as yoy will, add a block for them... Cheers"""
In the beginning of the year for my math and science classes I plan to use this evidence of brain research related to making mistakes. I also plan on introducing and discussing the idea of fixed and growth mindsets. I_m currently thinking of ways to celebrate mistakes and model their positive role in learning.  Any ideas/suggestions are welcomed!
Having persistence is such an important life skill that I think many youngsters lack in this age of instant answers and instant solutions.
"I work at Lockheed Martin this summer and they review mistakes weekly - but try to determine \Lessons Learned\"" from any errors.  I have really appreciated that process and want to bring it back to my students."""
And earlier in Their math careers.
"In my classroom, a lot of the confusion arises from the fact that students don't bother describing precisely what the variable in the equation should represent.  They start constructing an equation that shows the unknown, but often time the equation is incorrect.  For example, when my students hear there is a 2:3 ratio, they often construct the equation 2x=3x (whose solution is unreasonable in this context).  Of course, my question to them is: what does x represent? and why are you using the same variable to represent two quantities that may not be equal?"
"That's terrific! Are you still in touch with Glenis? She and I connected a few times while I worked in Vancouver (in three different contexts, as it turned out), but I understand that she went back home to England last year. Say hello for me please if you are still in touch with her."
"Hey <redacted>, there is always the facebook group if you're on facebook. Just type how to learn math in the facebook search bar."
Great points. I think it's <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>portant for parents and teachers to share how they currently get extra help to succeed in areas where they are trying to grow. Too much of the t<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>e this is obscured to children.
"Thanks - this clarified it for me. I do the same but was using a and p and thought \oh no, it's all wrong\"", but was still confused. Now I know how to subtly change what I was doing before."""
Yes!  Many of our students who struggle with math desperately need to acquire the skills to see numbers in a visual sense.
"I don't use them at all to teach.  I find **'Autograph'** is far, far better for investigating."
"I love that they saw math as free and that you could, \do whatever you want\"". I was watching this video before faculty meeting started at my school and I brought up that quote to my peers. One of my coworkers immediately said, no it's not there are rules and rigidity. I love this dialogue."
"Hi, I sometimes try to let the students be free to pick up a problem they personally like, out from a pool proposed."
"I agree that if done correctly, the idea of \co-teaching\"" is of great benefit to all the students.  However, what I find happens most often is that the homeroom teacher takes on the lead role and the special ed teacher, or interventionist is given a secondary role.  What that leads to in my experience, is that the homeroom teacher is seen as \""the teacher\"" by the students and the other teacher is seen as \""the helper\"". This has a negative effect on everyone concerned, both teachers and students.  It's very difficult to balance that situation to work towards the benefit of everyone involved.  Imagine yourself or your child having to work with \""the helper\"".  I don't imagine that instills much confidence in that child, which then has a detrimental effect on the student."""
"I like using the examples of Albert Einstein, Walt Disney, Michael Jordan, etc. and how continued to persevere through their setbacks."
It's amazing how differently we see things. I liked how ideas were shared.
I have graded 4 or 5 examples of problem 4.5 but it still shows that I have not done any.
The fact that they described maths as free and that you can do whatever you want.  Most people see maths as a set of rules to follow.  They were also not bothered about making mistakes as everybody makes them and it is good to learn from them

"I would like to make every day a day to explore and push out of comfort zones.  I'm going to give my students challenging math problems and have the courage to step back and let them do the solving.  Of course I'll add a few questions here and there or encourage them to look around in other groups for ideas, etc.  but the focal point will be on the students being math thinkers, not on running to me for 'the answers'.  Also, that getting messy and making mistakes is ok - it's all fundamentally important to learning, and really that's why we're all here - to support each other in our learning, and have a wonderful time in the process."
Patterns!
"I don't know if A impacts B or B impacts A.  I think it is a cycle of cause and effect.  The methods are taught in schools and colleges which in turn as teachers we \teach\"" the way we were \""taught.\""  Therefore, it is a lack of fundamental and foundational knowledge.  We have failed to connect math to the real world.  We learned that math is facts, theories and memorization; therefore we teach it in that manner."""
The program would not permit me to go back and revise my response. Is there a fix?
"I will encourage the students I work with that making mistakes is fine, as they generally have the fixed mindset that they are hopeless at maths as they always get it wrong! I tend to work in small groups or on a one-to-one level within the class supporting the teacher, so it is difficult to have a whole class policy! I will try and encourage 'Mistake making is good' within the maths department though.  "
I think dot cards are important because it lets you see how a person visualizes a problem. It almost seems like you are inside their heads and seeing through their eyes when they explain how they solved the problem

"Not every one is good at math. Some people are just better at it than others. For example, it's actually o.k. if girls don't achieve in math because girls aren't as good as boys when it comes to math.  Also, Asian-Americans are really good in math."
"in the students' responses.  One student said several times that math is free and open.  He said he liked the way you could decompose, break down, and use friendly numbers.  I was surprised with another student's comfort level, when describing friendly numbers, of rattling off the addition problem 5 + 5 + 7 + 4 and knowing quickly which were the friendly numbers.  I was surprised in how much the students enjoyed the math classes and actually were comfortable with math processes.  Even though they did not think that math was about following rules, they clearly understood the rules.  I guess they did not think of them as rules, but of the way the numbers worked."

"By allowing students to visualize addition problems they are able to creatively apply their own thinking to attaining an answer. In addition, in discussing it in a group students can see how their peers came to an answer while visualizing the students thought process as well. This type of an assignment gives the student the ability to develop and solidify their understanding of number sense."
"I thoroughly enjoyed watching the class discuss the dot cards. The very notion that the class was able to generate so many different ways of visualizing how to count to ten was rather profound to me. I was simultaneously seeing 3+3+2+2 as well as 3+3+4 (the square). I don't think I would ever have counted on the diagonal. I believe the benefit of this class discussion is it opens up alternative viewpoints for students to discuss. As a lover of math and numbers, I always appreciate learning new ways to deconstruct and reconstruct patterns, and this helped me grow (at least a little). I think the benefits of this are subtle but far reaching for the students. Unfortunately for all my love for it, I wonder how incredibly boring it could be to many students. I will definitely try this one out. I am thinking of implementing a weekly, or bi-weekly numbertalk with my 10th and 11th grade students. Any suggestions on how to differentiate the number talk between Algebra 2 and Geometry classes would be much appreciated."
ditto - I too did the survey & pretty much all of session one but it is coming up only half is done? I don't know why... maybe its a glitch
"They are important because they help us break the paradigm that numbers are what they are. They help us get into our systems that numbers are made up of other numbers and that we can \play\"" with them and that we can break them into many forms. Having that plasticity in mind, we can get to think that mathematic problems as well endure that ability of being approached in different ways."""
"I think that there is something to say about saying you're accepting of mistakes and actually being accepting of mistakes.  How do you respond to your own mistakes?  Perhaps rather than saying something, I will make some of my own mistakes and encourage acceptance of such mistakes."

"I felt exactly the same way.   I realized there were topics not yet covered, so I saved what I had done, but when I came back to the survey it did not automatically recall what I had saved and I did not see how to get the saved version back."
"I have that problem too. I think the open minded tasks discussed in this class does some of the differentiating for you. It has been my experience that students solve the problem at the level they are at, if the problem is truly designed properly. AHa that is the key great tasks. I am frustrated when there are not more resources like the Shell Center available. I am frustrated when my classroom resources are the traditional curriculum because that is what the school board understands about learning."
"Thanks for the website. I typically have students in my sixth grade class ranging from 2nd to high school algebra skills. I pull lots on more in depth work from math meet questions, mensa puzzlers, and set students up with alternative packets and math texts. Personally I like the way Saxon Math works for kids working independently at times.  The deal I have with my students that are more advanced is that they join in on discussions and group work where I feel they will be able to provide alternate ways of approaching a problem. Another thing I sometimes do is pullout math units that never get taught in depth - probability, geometry etc. I also use Ed Zaccaro's Challenge Math and REal Life Problem Solving books - he has them for primary, intermediate, middle school and high school. The Einstein level questions are fairly tricky and have entertained a 6th grade student that I had been having do the first have of Algebra 1 independently."
"Have to admit....have not heard that before in a math class!  Sold on number talks....kids can make the problems their own, and break them down \decompose\"" them to a problem they can do.  What I liked most is there was no fear of getting the problem wrong and they understood the learning opportunity."""
"As a fifth grade teacher and mother of three middle school students, I have seen how much easier it is to learn new skills and concepts if a student has a semi fluent grasp of multiplication facts. We teach strategies for understanding the concept of multiplication, then students practice using... timed tests. Are there alternatives to timed tests? I don't want to create more anxiety in students who are already over-tested and would rather be a positive influence in their life-long enjoyment of math!"
Does this seem to wordy?
"Hi Karen,"
"It has been a practice in my district (for a very long time - so there is a real community expectation and culture established) to begin identifying students at the end of third grade for \accelerated math\"" where they will be placed in a curriculum that compacts the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade standards into two years. As the  standards have gotten more rigorous some are beginning to question the practice, but more from the stance that we don't have enough students that we feel can truly accelerate.  I think all the research that has been shared may be able to help us break through this long standing practice! :)  I liked Dr. Boaler's point that when you have truly mixed groups teachers will see a need to differentiate.  Teachers who teach the accelerated group or honors level students in middle and high school often see no need to differentiate."
"I don't agree that 'Girls are not good at Maths' and I haven't heard any of my colleagues saying this during my teaching life.  However, I have heard and also made this comment myself that \These students are strong in literacy but not in numeracy\"".  I feel that some students are naturally better at Maths than other students.  But by saying this, I do not mean that those who are not naturally good at Maths can't get better at Maths.  I believe that they can still get better by putting the required effort and proper guidance."""
"Jam, I would also like to hear the details of your problem.  I think those kinds of problems are a fun way to get kids to practice computation."
"It's amazing that they love math.  They sound so enthused about it, which is great.  I think they like it most that they are sharing with their partners and then sharing with the class.  They feel safe in making mistakes because they understand that it helps them."
IF that were true then how did the researchers change the mindsets of the students with the comments?
"I teach adult students and it's not uncommon to hear \I can't do math\"" or \""I hate math\"".  I used to tease them that I would get an \""I hate math\"" jar and have them put a quarter in it every time they said something negative like that.  One day, I thought, hey, why not try some positive reinforcement instead?  I got a jar and wrote \""I love math\"" on it and filled it with candy.  I tell students on the first day of every class that if I catch them saying something negative, they will have to stand in front of the class and say the opposite; then they can get a piece of candy.  The students just laugh.  Usually within the first couple of days, I'll catch someone and follow through as promised.  It's all done with a good spirit and I've never had anyone get upset.  The students then start trying to catch each other and having fun with that.  But the amazing thing, is it really has changed how I hear students talk about math and their ability to be successful at it!  I used to hear the negative comments daily and I would always talk to them about the power of words, but now I hardly ever hear students say it anymore.  In fact, I often hear them say \""I love math!\"" in a joking tone and I tell them \""fake it till you make it!\""  Once they start seeing success in math, it won't be a joke anymore!"""
"What resources did you use? I would love to try some project based teaching in my class, but I am stuck for ideas on what kinds of things to try. Any suggestions you have for resources would be great!"
"Shannon and Michelle, I'm really excited to read about your work in Adult Education. That is not my area of focus but something I've been interested in for a long time. I can appreciate how the content of Session 1 will be valuable for your students."
I had the same problem.
"Thank you, Mylene.  You're videos are very helpful."
I think this hits it right on the money.  The stereotype threat has to be explicitly named and addressed right out of the chute.  I think even preschool teachers should address it with their children.
"Parents will tell me, in front of their kids, that math does not make sense and it is very hard. Also--there is the idea that needing help is bad or weak or shameful. In my first upper division math class, I admitted to the teacher, in front of the class, that I was completely lost on the first assignment. I was the only woman in the class, and older then everyone, inc instructor. I was a PARIAH for about a week after that. Though everyone else also was lost."
"Yes, I've taken to not bothering with paragraphs anymore because of this."
"Is 1+2+1, 1+2+3+2+1, 1+2+3+4+3+2+1,......."
The key concept that speed is not enough nor is it even necessary...I also liked the mathematician being able to see relationships.  I am already reconsidering my multiplication fact timings...
"There are several ways to differentiate besides grouping.  If everyone is given the same task (not one that has been made easier by the teacher because they are in a lower level) then they can bring their prior knowledge to the problem and make sense of it.  I am talking about the rich tasks that Dr. Boaler mentioned earlier that are open ended and have several entry points. In addition, during the end of class discussion everyone is discussing the same task and all students can learn from the different approaches people brought to the problem."
"I have come around to the idea that ability grouping is not beneficial.  It took awhile, but over the past two years, I have come to realize that those in the \low\"" class will NEVER catch up.  They are never given the challenging material so that they CAN catch up.  Also, our \""high\"" class just knows how to solve problems.  They HATE mistakes, and only care about the \""grade\""."
"You also sound like an excellent teacher, reflective and resourceful, with good class management skills.  The expectations for our teachers (content, large class sizes, intervention needs, wide diversity of students background knowledge and skills) is crippling (\survival mode\"").  I wonder how this will effect the teaching profession and longevity."""
"I like the poster- if you get it right the first time, it was too easy.  etc."
"Hi, I usually type up a response with line breaks and spaces in my text to help lay it out better. However, when I submit my response, it seems to \eat\"" all my line breaks and extra spaces that I had put in."
"**We are here to learn**. We don't already have the answers, we will discover them. One of the ways in which we will discover them is by making mistakes, and making mistakes helps our brains to grow."
"Much of stereotyping is pre-conscious (or unconscious).  We make judgements before we know that we have.  Before we \think.\""  The judgements come out in gestures, inflections, subtle expressions that we are not even aware of.  It could be the student that we call on, the smile that we give.  If we are to counter these things of which we are not conscious in our interactions with others we must do so consciously and conscientiously.  We have to make a point to compensate."
I would like to see this question addressed.
"The four factors listed were good ones, although there are copious factors as to why many have been in the past and are unsuccessful in mathematics in today's day and age."
"I think this is an excellent message to give students.  I think students at all grade levels would benefit from this message, not just first graders."
"I also would like our classroom to be a safe environment where each student is valued.  I would begin by telling them to look around at all of the brains that we have in our classroom.  Are they all alike? What makes them different?  Won't it be exciting to hear and learn from each brain in our class?  This discussion could keep going and lead to how we will make mistakes as we go, but we will learn from them and our brain will even grow when we make mistakes.  How fun is that!"
That is a super idea. Thanks.
"I may sometimes think these thoughts about our students, but at the same time I am asking myself: Why are they not paying attention, or are not engaged? What do I need to do different to maintain their attention. What do I not know that will help me keep their focus? Sometimes, I am in a hurry to get the lesson done on time that I forget and do not ask myself these questions until the end of the day. As I write this I need to learn how to prepare myself for these interruptions or sidetracks before the lesson starts."
I didnt see these dynamics either.
"I agree that many students lack needed foundation knowledge and the teaching methods need to be adapted to meet the needs of the students.  As a parent, I experienced having a daughter who was considered very bright and did everything that was required of her and more, but lost confidence in her ability to do math in high school when she encountered a teacher who seemed out of touch with where his students were and how to teach them.  These were a group of students who were considered above average in their abilities, and at least fifty percent of them needed tutors.  The money paid for tutors could have added another teacher to the class."
"I see this as well in my classroom and with my own children. It is a result of everything being available to them almost instantaneously without much effort. Anything that goes against this, requiring effort or extended persistence to reach an answer or goal, is tossed to the side as too hard, too time-consuming, and they look for someone to show them the 'shortcut'."
"Mathematics is about concepts, ideas, patterns. If you can understand them well, mathematical language, as he mentioned mathematical formulas, are more easy to understand, because they are just graphical representations of concepts, ideas and patterns. I agree with him."
"Sometimes, though, you are paid to be a teacher. This does not always mean lecturing, but more sages are needed and less facilitators. There can be a balance; sadly, many teachers neither have the knowledge nor preparation to be a sage."
"I plan to have a bulletin board or entire walls filled with quotes from famous people and from the Bible (Christian High School) about work, persistence, mistakes and failure. We will spend part of the first day talking about some of the quotes. I'll ask the students what the speaker meant by the quote and try to challenge their current ways of thought and current habits regarding mistakes. I will also share with them the research that brains grow as a result of making mistakes and reflecting on them."
I want my students to have inquiry relationship with maths by being curious; making conjectures and proving them; by being self confident that they can solve any problem and not worrying about making mistakes.
That is sad!!! I hate when people blame the genetic code and predispose their children to silly ideas. Everyone is capable of learning.
I am from Maine also. I teach 6-8 Math and Science in Waldo County.
"Dear Professor Jo Boaler,"
"the fact that they though math was freeing and it wasn't about rules.  So many kids think that math is about rules and procedures, it was nice to think that these kids thought it was fun and they could come up with new ways to do the problem."
Sometimes students hear these negative messages from teachers or classmates who have find Math difficult to understand.
$1.50 + x - $3.20 = $2.30
"I like how the kids talked about Friendly numbers- they seemed excited about math.  Usually when you talk to kids about Math ( unless it's the \Smart\"" ones) there is lots of complaining about math."""
I'm surprised by the poor results. I'd presume that different teachers teaching the same material would be presenting in different ways and that perhaps it's not the teaching at this level but the teaching going on much earlier (such as Vivian's teacher and how she 'taught' the 7 times table).
"When you do a task like this, you see one method quickly, and if pressed, might be able to come up with one or two more methods. It's really valuable for students to see that  there are way more methods than they thought of. This idea that there are multiple solution paths is in and of itself helpful, but it's even more helpful when you find that you like someone else's method better and might use it in the future."
"How did you set out the scheme of learning for the knowledge range of level 3 to level 8, as for it to work you need to have lots of rich tasks"
"I keep getting an \out of sync, please reload\"" error message that prevents me from submitting my answer"""
"AT 13:14 in the video where Cathy asks for an algebraic reprentation of Joe's method, the class settles on 25(29+1). This gives 750 which is not the answer to 25x29. Wouldn't a better representation be: 25(30-1)?"
mine is missing too - saw it earlier in the day - maybe they released it too early or tweaking it some more :)
What is going on with Session 1 progress?  I have completed all of session 1 but it only shows me having completed about 60%.
"I was not the best at math when I was at school. I had help from home but it was the way my teachers introduced and taught the concepts that were not fitted for me. I am not surprised by the data; however, I feel we need to do something better than that! I usually try different teaching strategies for my students to be successful. Is that enough? Maybe not... But I need to continue trying..."
"I find that I am guilty of encouraging this contract, because I am viewing the student herself as the problem to be solved -- if I tweak this, or drop that clue, what will happen?"
Are there benefits of not grouping students? I haven't seen this data. I don't like ability groups (as stated in an earlier thread) but each child develops at a different rate. Is it fair for the fast learners to be held behind? Is it fair for the slower learners to be pushed ahead? I don't have the answers. Maybe our problem lies within the age = grade criteria.
"I'm seeing the same thing.  It shows I havent completed anything, but I've done all of session 1.  It must be a glitch in the system, Im sure we'll get credit."
"I can draw and reason out the cubes, but the algebraic notation is far beyond my skill level working alone. I would like to participate in an exercise like this to see if I could contribute. I guess I have been in elementary math too long! I had to watch this video several times, and came away with the onion peeling theory that could be adapted for for my students and my understanding. It was very frustrating. I still do not have it all."
"Sorry guys, I only just realised I needed to do this (this is my first online course!), I have done it now."
Dot card number talks are important because they allow the student to think of math numbers visually rather than symbolically. This provides an opportunity for students to explore and experience the the flexibility with numbers that they may not realize through numeric representation.

Thanks <redacted>!  I have my certificate now.
We had CMP2.  I was referring to CMP3.  I didn't like those supplemental books at all.  I'm pretty sure they weren't written by the original authors.
These student enjoyed learning about Math. The environment they have been learning has fostered the opportunity to have some freedom and flexibility when solving problems. They are learning new strategies as they explain their thinking in a supportive environment in which mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities.
"At the elementary level we use grouping not only for math instruction but in reading and when creating classes for the following year. The students realize that they are in the \low\"" class because the special education students are in their class; or they are in the \""high\"" class because of the gifted and talented students are with them. As a school we are told to put them in these groups for instruction purposes, so how are we able to break the mold of placing these students in these groups?"""
I noticed that if you can do math mentally for the most part people see it as you being better so to speak at math. I myself cannot really grasp the concepts unless I am writing them on paper.
"I've been reviewing far more than required (about 25 so far, to help cut back the collection of ungraded responses (I assume some people have dropped out, because there aren't as many for later questions.) So it would help if we'd all go in and work on the responses from lessons 1 and 3 in particular! (And I have had responses from lesson 4! Hurrah!"
"This would cause me to rethink how I teach math.  The concepts need to be taught in a variety of methods..kinesthetic, audio, visual, etc.  i need to stop my team and myself from the fixed ability talk, plus not allow it from the students.  I need to teach knowing all can learn!"
"I work with little kids.  When I am trying to encourage them, I always ask them to think about how a baby learns to walk.  I ask them if a baby is born walking?  What does the baby have to do first? How many times does a baby fall down before it can stand up?  Take a few steps?  Walk with out falling down?  Little kids can relate to this because they are usually around other kids who are learning to walk.  Then I tell them that you have to try lots and lots of times before you get good at something.  Like drawing, like counting, like recognizing numbers. It demonstrates that it is okay to make mistakes or not be good at something new."
"Toward the end of Session 4, Dr. Boaler mentions the video of a Japanese lesson we watched, but I never saw it. Can anyone tell me where to find it?  Thanks!"
"I grew up in a country where there were no tracking in education. So, I have no experience what it feels like to be in either track. However, teaching here in the United States gave me some experience on how kids feel in this system, mainly those who are placed in grade level grouping. They loose confidence in their ability and they think they are not smart and that those who are in advanced classes are the smart ones. It is self-fulfilling prophecy, even if they are the brightest, unfortunately, they believe they aren't and they become what they believe. There is a wide academic gap between the two groups at the 7th or 8th grade levels, as I see it in my school. All students get promoted to the next level regardless whether they learned the maths or not, as a result the academic gap gets wider and wider as students move on from k1 to 8th grade. "
"In my opinion, to track students is a completely waste of time, and they can damage the kids better than help them. We used to track students in low-medium-high classes some years ago, and the results are not significant in terms of better achievement or learning. But, these years, the government \forces\"" us to do these tracks due to the lack of hours for the teachers, so if you don't track students, you have two classes of 30 students each (4 sessions each week), but if you track students you will have three classes of 20 students (approx) each. So the choice for the maths Department is obvious, even when you know that this is not going to make any benefit of your students. I would say it's sad but true, this is what the government in Spain wants."""
"I was surprised to hear the term free for describing math.  I never thought of it that way.  Since we began using a math program that incorporates math talks into the lessons, I was not surprised by most of what they said.  I know for our struggling students that the math talks really helped and all students were comfortable making mistakes in front of the peers at the end of the first year in the program.  I also feel that for students to feel this comfortable about math that the teacher has to feel comfortable about what is being taught to set up a freeing experience."
"It is interesting how we often hide behind humor. Too bad someone didn't call her on the tutoring center and her bias. This is how we all became aware of our bias about smoking helping control weight, eating junk food was fast and cheap, ignoring speed limits got you where you were going quickly, etc."
"Cathy first gives wait time for the solving of the problem. Next she asks those who solved it quickly to come up with another way to solve it. During the explanations, she continually says stop, rewind, forcing the students to raise their mathematical awareness as they explicitly describe the process they went through. When it came time to name algebraic properties, she gave them time to talk together, encouraging them to draw pictures with their fingers to help them visualize the arrays. Finally she encouraged all to participate by asking for input from someone who had not yet spoken."
"I can't help but think about how excited NICK was during this activity.  How many students have a teacher that jumps around and stays excited about their material?  Wait...maybe, just maybe, Nick doesn't have to teach the same lesson 6-7 times a day.  Could that make a difference?"
"The big ideas are: Algorithmic, Negative Feelings and Experiences, Real World Context"
I agree with what you said as I too always challenge the high students and work with students who need extra practice. I am not sure how to turn this around!
I like the idea of getting comfortable with being uncomfortable.  I think this will stick with kids.
I agree completely with you
The big step is to change the mindset of students and teachers from one that limits the learners with the perception that math skills are gifted to one that encourages all with the notion that mathematical skills are learned (since as quoted; þintelligence is malleable).
"Apparently not. I am now using dashes and semicolons to mark lists etc. It's a little thing and as a peer reviewer, I see that others are facing the same issue. It's okay."
Not all students have the same ability. Some can be nurtured. 
Dot card number talks are the precursor to regular number talks. It's a way to get kids started with explaining things mathematically and also to show them that there are 4-5 ways of seeing/doing things. Greg Tang is author of math books that writes children's books about this.
Yes.
"Now I have just met a special case of a 13 years old boy, who used to tell to himself that he was not good for math, even he use to say \I don_t now anything about math\"". When I talk to him, he told me he has this idea since he was 8 years old. It was very illuminating to me when I talked to his mom, and his professor and they said exactly the same words: he is not good for math."
"Congratulations on your baby!  I think math nerds are wonderful.  I am a collaborative teacher for middle school math, so I appreciate the love of math you instill in my future students."
"We are moving to more levels of math next year, taking our heterogeneously grouped sixth grade and creating two levels that are more homogeneous, and creating three levels in seventh as well. In theory, students will be able to move flexibly between levels as they grow in their math understanding. I am worried that we will do all of the things that Dr. Boaler has referenced and will create students with fixed mindsets about their ability who are not exposed to work that is as challenging and therefore get trapped in a lower level. I wish that this course would stay up longer than until September 27 so that we could encourage all of our middle school parents and our school committee members to take it!"

"Jo and colleagues, Is there any research on 'self-streaming', as in when learners (a) choose different levels of content as in the Danish high school system, or (b) choose different levels of tasks within the same classroom, but according to self-assessment, mostly? <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
"Being a teacher myself, I have noticed when students come to me from previous grades and do not have a strong foundation in math, they fall behind rather quickly.  The more the school year progresses, the more discouraged they become and quit trying.  Even though small grouping is required with our school as well as intervention, that sometimes is not enough.  Students need to not only have time to \practice\"" math, but opportunities to explore math using technology and manipulatives.  We need to focus less on state testing or high stakes tests and more on exploration and creativity."""
I must say I agree with this statement based on my experiences in middle school. I have had students with learning disabilities make amazing progress in the same class as high ability students who make minimal progress. I believe some of the responsibility of learning should be rightly placed upon the students and parents shoulders as well.

I grew up in Jamaica and did fine in maths but my first day in a US classroom I asked the Algebra teacher for clarification of an explanation and was told that because I was Black, I was unable to learn maths. I was 13 years old and essentially gave up on learning math. Which in retrospect is painful because I used to sit and read math textbooks for fun, but somehow I came to buy into the ideas that I was too stupid to do math if I could not understand a garbled explanation. "

I read \Mindset\"" several months back, and am attempting to approach mathematics and other parts of life with a growth mindset. I'm naturally curious, so this has been fairly easy, except when attempting to overcome the little nay-sayer voice in my head about my own math and music ability!

I thought in terms of partial products.
"Learning math can be easy if the math teacher is determine,patient,resourceful and well equip with approaches and techniques.  teaching math the easiest way that one can easily understand .Using experimental,pictures,trial and error, and drawings may help them arrived into  good answer if not correct as long as the children were enjoying the subject and the activities through games ."
"I agree with most other posts that a and b are the reason people are having such difficulty with math. As an elementary school teacher (grade 1 and 2), I see how important it is for my students to have the basic math facts memorized (+-x/). On the other hand, as the mother of 2 teenage boys, I see how the methods of their teachers require too. Much memorization of equations with little understanding of the concepts. Math is a subject that needs to be studied, but also needs an intuitive understanding to it. We use so many manipulatives in the primary years to ensure that our students understand the underlying concepts. Why doesn't this continue into older grades?"
"I am curious to see these pre-tests as we are implementing SGOs next year, which require us to give pre-tests to students to measure growth."

"The idea is that whenever possible, direct instruction is the responsibility of students outside of class--usually by watching videos about the material, but also be reading.  The exercises that we would normally think of as homework are done in class instead, where the teacher is available to help as needed.  There is a summary at http://www.knewton.com/flipped-classroom/"
I read Lockhart's book about a year ago and will happily crack my kindle open and read it again!
give two ways of finding the perimeter for 36.
I have another question for Jo:
The fact that people can see other ways to solve the problem illustrates the potential for conversation that number talks allow. The dot cards are visual and make solving the problem less intimidating. The opportunity to see multiple interpretations increases the likelihood that students will think with flexibility when dealing with numbers.
"so glad to hear that your results show the same than the research experiments. Particularly I don't like the grouping, people should compete with themselves and try to improve by comparing what they could do before and what they can do now. I believe that that's the real challenge."
I like the idea that each error will grow your brain.  Sharing this with students can help to change the classroom belief system to look at errors as a chance to frow their brain.

"I work in a PreK-Gr8 that does not use letter grades.  All of our feedback is diagnostic.  Each trimester, we issue reports to parents and students that consist of narrative comments on a student's progress towards specified objectives.  It takes teachers a lot of time to write these but is worth it."
"I absolutely agree.  I teach science and one of the main things students need to be able to do is see patterns.  This is also true in math.  The dot cards help students key into patterns to help them solve the problem.  I love how everyone sees the pattern a little differently.  Students tend to want to follow \the Rules\"" whatever they think they are and this method frees them up!"""
Agree - the dots take away the fear of the numbers.
Can you share the title of this book?
"I so agree with what has been shared. I have seen some of this research before and it makes total sense to me but then you get into the school system and it is hard to change the way things have always been done. I am a Special Education teacher and have had many ideas of how to change my teaching practices to help my student to have higher achievement in the past and have not done a very good job at it. After taking this course I have decided to this year have my students working on grade level math with extra support. My students do not have the math reasoning background because they have not been taught in this growth mindset way and I am going to try to change this for them. Right now changing how students are grouped will be difficult but I can change the way I teach and the way my students learn while in my classroom. This will at least be a start. I attended some math trains this year put on by our state that taught this very thing, using tasks to teach and this growth mindset philosophy so I hope in time all teachers will teach this way."
"are important to do b/c people can see that there are many ways to see something mathematically. one persons way is not better than anothers, and the ways are related in some way or another."

"Genuine interest in student thinking goes a long way, I feel like this concept has yield significant gains in student engagement in math. My students are young so I want them to see themselves as mathematicians and when I am interested in how they are pursuing a problem or how I perceive their effort, I think they really see themselves as mathematicians. I have received feedback that many of my students move on to second grade with this mentality."
20x5-2x5=90
"We need more instruction about how to \grade\"" the multiple-choice answers. It says the response are submitted, but your to press \""check\"" in order to grade it. I cannot find where the \""check\"" button is."""
"I read somewhere the a lot of people had dropped out of the course, but their responses were still in the loop to be peer graded, but, of course, those people aren't doing any peer grading themselves.  It would be nice to reorder the pending responses such that responses from people still active in the class were moved to the front of the list."
I agree -- it's right there.  Every one did it a different way but came up with the same answer.
Thanks for the suggestions!
"I will present the \why\"" & \""how\"" of this message to students on day one and continue to prove it throughout the year as I encourage curiosity, inquiry, perseverance, and growth within the students. Mistakes will be a key element, and parents will also be recipients of this message and of how they need to partner in this approach to learning math in particular!"""
"I like your interpretation, that it isn't threatening because it doesn't look like math.  What do dot talks look like in high school?"
1= (4x4)/(4/4)
I also multiplied 10 X 5 then 8 X 5 and added the two products.
Problem solved! The reset button appears only after one has scored the response.
"Love this, wish it would work for the very young"
I wish we could reopen our submissions. I've had additional thoughts on several topics.
I have completed all the tasks in the Introduction however I have not been credited for them. What do I do next?
It is now working on firefox
"It would be great if each video (i.e., each \Part\"" in each \""Session\"") had a descriptive title, and maybe a one-paragraph introduction. This would ease finding specific topics again later on."""
"I'm not sure what she is asking here, and perhaps the math is just above me. Here is how I answered the two parts of the question:I think the students reacted to the problem by  reasoning, and visualizing and drawing representations of their ideas, and collaborating together, everyone had input, and they took time if one wasn_t following another_s process to explain it which all enabled learning."
Still waiting for my session 1 questions to be scored!
I don't see a survey.
"I, too, minored in math in college.  I chose to do so because I felt I could do better than I had previously in high school.  I don't feel that I really understood it until I had to teach it to another person.  I had never completed a proof until I had to teach them.  Since I teach high school math, I introduce the concepts of mathematical proof very early and try very hard to link it to the math students learned back in elementary school (when they were good at math)."
"The language that the boys used: decomposed, friendly numbers; math is \free\"" (I liked that one )"
"Parents who say, \I can't get this 'new' math.\"" Well, put yourself to work and problem solve what you need...and you will get the math! That is a better message...\""it doesn't come easily in our family; you may have to work twice as hard.\"" Parents who look to their child's future these days will see that having math opens doors to excellent jobs in communications, tech development and basic engineering. In the Steve Jobs bio that I recently read, he tells President Obama that he manufactures overseas because he would need 30, 000 basic engineers to monitor the manufacture of Apple products and they weren't available in the US. "
You might like my comment which I posted 2 hours after yours <redacted>.
They are trying to sole the problem that is formulated just below that yellow cube on a previous video. One of the questions is how many cubes will have ONLY ONE side painted. Next question: exactly two sides painted. And so on. Just enlarge the slide in a video clip( Ctrl and +) and you will be able to read a very small print.
"I think the visual of the brain growing and creating a synapse when mistakes are made is very powerful, and many of my students need to SEE something to believe it. I would show them the video of the brain growing/synapse being created and ask them to write about what they think just happened to make the brain do it. I will have them discuss with someone and try to encourage creativity. Then, after taking responses, I will tell them the brain grew after a mistake was made."
"Yes, and did you catch how the girl who was struggling actually contributed an additional original solution to the problem! She was turning one foot into 12 inches as she was still trying to inaccurately multiply-when-dividing, and her statement was what resulted in 1 / (2/3) being converted into 12 / 8 , which very easily turns into 1.5. "
"I know for me, that it is difficult to get feedback that is not praise.  It has taken me many years to be able to truly \hear\"" constructive feedback...and I'm still working at it.  I think that when someone says they believe in me, my brain stops in its tracks and listens, rather than going to a wholly emotional response.  I am able to \""hear\"" the things that that person saw as possible stumbling points in my work."
"Hi all,"
"The day 1 activities will include a message about mistakes and their importance.  Many people try to hide the fact that they make mistakes, but students will be shown the benefits of mistakes and what happens in their brains when mistakes are made and corrected.  I really like to have student analyze mistakes instead of just copying down how to do the problem correctly."
I felt really bad with a recent quiz in stat.
"<p> This will make a paragraph. </p>  <h1> This will make a heading </h1>  <p> Type (less than symbol, p, greater than symbol, without spaces or commas in between) before you begin each paragraph.  Type  less than symbol, slash, p, greater than symbol at the end of each paragraph.</p>  Type (less than, h1, greater than) (or h2, etc.,) at the beginning, and (less than, slash, h1, greater than) at the end of a phrase to make a heading.  The above example is h1.</p>"
Thanks for sharing!
I get frustrated & at times belittle myself thinking I am stupid :(
We do grade level whole group instruction and ability small group instruction for reading and math.  We have been told that this should result in great student achievement as students are receiving instruction at their ability level.  This should also produce fluid grouping as students should progress out of lower ability groups.  This is all supposed to be research-based and we should all have great success if taught with fidelity.  
I just was curious - what does STEM subjects stand for? These were referred to in the example of the stereotyped messages at the university level calculus math course....just wondering if someone could answer this for me. Thanks.
"I think this is very important because oftentimes, students don't realize that there can be other points of view or they've never thought about something in more than one way. Looking at different perspectives make learning more of a process than a static event."
I liked being able to be the commentary.
"I grew up when students were shown how to do a problem, and then the teacher would hold these speed contests to see who could solve the problems the fastest.  I learned how to mimic what the teacher did, and then I learned how to do it as fast as I could, and I \won\"" many of these contests.  I thought I was brilliant.  Looking back, it seems my whole math education was like this, and I was always stuck with the \""WHY\"" question in my head."""
"Maths is about the patterns and relationships that exist in the world and not about speed, accuracy and formulas."
I teach 2nd grade and I would say that around 90% of my students do still have that curiosity in them. I would say that 100% of my students can have the curiosity sparked through the right kind of math tasks and questions.
"I agree with you.  It makes such perfect sense to stop tracking, but when I get back to my tracked classes and students, I find it harder to imagine some of them in the same class together."
"Hi <redacted>,"
"Definitely, \can't\"" is a swear word in my class."""
The teacher gave the students time to make sense of what they thought 1 2/3 is before giving the algorithm.  Four students gave their rationale.  Each student presented a test of what they thought was correct then the procedural ways were presented.
"This keeps coming to my mind too. Does being able to decompose numbers in the ways we have been shown presuppose fluency with multiplication tables, at least up to 12? I can't help thinking that the students wouldn't be able to appreciate this freedom this foundation. I'd love to be shown/told otherwise!"
"Every week, my math students fill out a feedback form that first rates their experience in class (choose a facial expression). They then describe the best part of math class for them that week, the worst part, and something they would like to learn in the future (related to math). Then we either talk about it as a whole class or I break them into smaller groups for discussion. I make sure to incorporate some of their suggestions into future class periods"
"I work in a rural middle school that does not group by ability. In my classroom when students collaborated on work, I mixed all levels of abilities together because of my belief that everyone can learn from someone else. Students seemed to like it and worked very well together, giving everyone the opportunity to speak and be heard and contribute to the groups."
Thank you for the link to Google cache!
I had a very similar thought.  They have all had experiences where they had to work through something.
Would there be any benefit to grouping students by their work pace and not ability?
A.  I often wonder if the math foundation students receive in K-5 is limited by the **level** of the teacher's personal understanding and training.  Perhaps we need degreed MATH teachers teaching at those levels?
"I think this is a great tool to really understanding that people can in fact have various ways to solve the same problem.  Each student looked at the problem in a slightly different way, yet they all arrived at the same answer."
how would that help change their self concept re math?
"Those negative messages could easily spread among peers, in schools or in communities. Some parents who had negative learning experience on math may pass such negative messages as well."
Thank you so much for sharing!  The throwing the paper is a really good idea!
I know that *Quick Reads* has some of these stories about mistakes that turnout well.  It might be good to have students read some of these.
I'm having the same problem so I am using headphones as a quick fix.
I know for my gifted daughter it was torture to be grouped with lower ability students.  She would end up doing all the work for the group because the others were either not capable or not willing to work.( The fixed mindset holding them back?)
"I feel that in my school and district at large teachers are required to move through the curriculum and have the students pass their district and state assessments to such a degree that they can not be very flexible.  They can move a student to a higher grade level for math by having that student go to another classroom.  Within the 3rd grade class, instance, the teacher has to make sure that all students pass the 3rd grade curriculum as it is presented in the Everyday Math curriculum.  I feel as though they have to spend so much time on the strugglers that they can do little more than through extra worksheets at the quicker students.  It would take a complete shift of attitude from the curriculum coordinator etc in the district to make the sort of flexible learning that has been described to happen.  I hate to be so negative, but my district is big on assessment and making the percentage of students pass the standardized tests increase."
I liked to hear how much they liked math. They seemed to enjoy the creativity. I liked how they didn't seem afraid to make mistakes.
"I am an Instructional Coach, and do not have a classroom of my own, but I am going to use the 5 strategies that Jo discussed of setting up norms.  I am going to dispense this information to my teachers during our professional development days.  I may create a small bookmark, or something for teachers to hang in their rooms as a constant reminder that we need to encourage mistakes from students, and that mistakes are how our brain grows."
"Yes, the young kids love the pictures but why do we stop when they get older? I was never taught algebra in pictures; consequently, I don't have a firm understanding of it."
students needs project based/real life examples
Here are a few more statistics found in the article linked below:
Nice acronym - double message!
Me too.
Is it working well?
Top three messages I hear from parents or students-
They lack foundational knowledge.
"Writing is definitely an activity that is naturally differentiated.  Kids are all at different ability levels in writing.  The challenge, as a teacher, comes in appropriately challenging every student/level."
"I am pondering how to welcome mistakes as learning opportunities without encouraging the jokers or lazy students in my class to intentionally make more mistakes (or not care about mistakes made)! I would like the students to always try to do their best, but ... when a mistake is made, that's ok ... in fact, figuring out why it was a mistake will stimulate extra brain growth!"
"Surprised with the breakdown of numbers into friendly numbers, and the level of confident they have gained to face any other maths class"
"I hated geometry in high school, really struggled, too. I just finished my 26th year teaching math.  Two of those years I had to teach geometry, and I really struggled.  I had to make it different from my high school geometry course, so we used lots of technology,...."
This is a very similar question to mine below on brain plasticity and genetics.
Our classroom loves mistakes because we want bigger brains.
"I've been grading more of section 3.2 where people are talking about ideas they have to foster a classroom where mistakes are OK.  It seems people have a lot of \ideas\"", but is anyone interested in a regular correspondence or meeting to test how these ideas actually work in practice and how to implement them?"""
So my question would be this:   is that algebraic thinking? 
"Hearing Sophie's experiences as a young student not doing so well in math and teachers passing it off as, \No worries you're a girl\"" and her mother supporting the stereotype is very sad and disappointing, but not surprising.  I feel that up to a certain point during the school year, teachers teach to the state regulated tests.  There are a lot of pressures on teachers to make sure that the curriculum is covered and that students do well on the standardized tests.  Consequently, they miss or dismiss the students who may \""bring down the score\"".  Teaching, as a profession, has changed because of all the testings that are required by the government.  As a result, there will be more students who will feel inadequate, disconnected, anxious about math."""
"I agree. I have signed up for several courses at different sites, and while this is the only one I am taking currently, I did have to pause and try to remember where I was taking it. Of course, this was addressed in the Welcome e-mail without a link, and within the reminder e-mail from last week."
"I am a primary school teacher in New Zealand, and at the moment we are in the middle of a change in how we teach maths in the primary years. There is an agreement that the ways maths has been taught here was not working for all children, and in fact there was often a discrepancy between the way they had been taught at primary school and the way they are taught and have to learn at secondary school. Because of this there is a move towards more conversation-based, problem-solving, group work at primary schools, and hopefully with this change in teaching and learning methods our tamariki (children) will be leaving primary school and heading off to high school or uni with a greater collection of foundational maths skills."
"I did my master online too and it was a bit more organized.  I am thrilled to hear all your comments, I just thought I was totally out of it and didn't understand the organization of this.  Thank you!"
"Rather than focusing on speed, we will be focus on continually challenging you - success in this course is not when you are able to quickly produce answers without thinking, but rather, sucess will be where you are continually encountering problems that challenge you. Underpinning this goal is the understaning that if you are challenged your brain is making new connections and you are learning  - by way of contrast, when you don't have to think about the answer, no growth is occurring, and no learning is happening."
yes I have completed but still says 60% finished so I am not sure what I need to do to get everything submitted up to 85% please advise.
"I have done something similar.  I like the discussion and the way the students in the video responded and tied the strategies together.  In all, they are various \proofs\"" of the various properties.  NICE way to introduce properties!"""
"I have a lot of faith that this will be addressed later in the course, but my thoughts when I'm told about the benefits of heterogenous grouping usually follow this script:"
"The boys said the sorts of things I expected, having seen how their lessons are conducted, and trusting that we would not be viewing a video that did not support use of math talks."
I will tell my students that they WILL make mistakes in math this year and that I am very excited about that because it will show that they are growing their math brains.
"I've discovered through my own experience as a child and by observing other schools is that few schools actually offer \gifted\"" students anything at all. I remember being asked to join the TAG (Talented and Gifted) program at my elementary school. The first question I asked was if it was just going to be more work or if we really were going to do something different. It turns out that it was just extra homework, who wants to do that? I was excited by the idea of getting different harder work or going to a different classroom for part of the day but that never happened. Finally, in 6th grade I got to take classes that were typically for 7th graders in some areas and that helped me a lot. Lastly I'm not convinced that mixed grouping is necessarily the best. We keep trying all these things in schools and none of them are a magical solutions and you what there isn't a magical solution especially when many of the students come from homes that are not ideal, that are broken, that do not value education, they hear negative messages about school all over the place. This is a societal problem, schools are one piece of the puzzle, and in my opinion it's not so much the teachers teaching that needs to change but the societal views of school in general that need to change."""
These kids clearly enjoy math and have a great attitude about it. It was great to see them so enthusiastic about all of the different things they had learned with Nick and that they weren't at all worried about learning math in the future.
...they want to please adults who they know care a lot about their education.  Right answers please adults.
"I remember the videos! These guys really surprised me when they spoke of being free to try what ever works for them. They will become great mathematicians, I'm sure."
B because of A.
Agree!
"They get it in their community.  They hear it on the bus, in the lunchroom, and general conversations with their peers."
Noticed that too!
"The focus should be on quantitative literacy which does require use of sound mathematical reasoning.  In doing so there is also a written component that goes with this. You cannot separate the two, without a sound understanding of the mathematics behind the data presented, either in tables, graphs, or charts you will not be able to extend your argument beyond superficial information."
I believe this is the link: http://www.mindsetworks.com/
I am finding it frustrating to have to do the same grading lesson over and over before I am able to continue on to read peers' assignments.
"Sophie was clearly tuned out in her education of geometry.  Unfortunately, it was not made relevant or made interesting.  It was only later in life as a part of her job that she understood the importance and relevance of geometry.  As teachers, we need to make geometry (as well as everything) else relevant and engaging for students."
"Hi - I'm a former teacher (French and Spanish) who just returned to the corporate sector, and a parent of two young kids.  I've often struggled with math vs. other subjects and want to not transfer those challenges to my own children."
This is engaging!
Thank you Prof. Boaler for a very illuminating course. Looking forward to creating an environment as you have described for my girls.
"My dad, the engineer, always encouraged me to take up engineering. He was very positive about my ability to learn math and to be an engineer. I minored in math, in college, almost!!!! I loved it up until the second to last course, in which I had no idea how to prove the algorithms we had accepted all along!"
Good to hear!  I sent email on Tuesday and this afternoon (Fri) but have heard nothing about session 5 issues.
"I am a little confused...moving kids to classes based on ability IS differentiation. They above-level students are receiving more challenging work, while the students who are on- or below-level are receiving more appropriate work. That is the whole point of differentiation!!"
It is Only those who do nothing make no mistakes. Mistakes help to learn..
"I like this slogan, short sweet and straight to the point."
Me too.  This is so great.
Ouch - totally different from PBS Word Girl where words give her power.
"I know what you mean. We can encourage and encourage, but the grade still discourages."
Very well put!
I am hoping that we learn in the next session that this is the type of question to avoid...at least for a while:)
I had forgotten I'd enrolled in this until today when the email appeared. 
"I agree effort is a key part to learning and likewise so are making mistakes, because that means having a go and trying out ideas to solving the problem. Persistence is also a key element. to persist in time of difficulty until you get it understand it."
"The link does not seem to be working for me at the moment.  I would submit the word  \Confidence.\"""""
Thanks great idea. I think i will borrow it.
I have over 125 students. When and how often do you call?
"That is a great motto. I think mine might be \I love mistakes, they help my math brain grow\""."""
When ever giving any type of feedback I always try and end on a positive...
"I liked your answer  because you asked them to think about a time they made a mistake, and what would have happened if they tried to learn form it. That makes a real life connection for them."
I totally agree that everyone has potential and that learning through mistakes is powerful and effective.
Hi!  I teach 4th grade and am always looking for ways to improve my math teaching as well as gain new ways to encourage students.  Can't wait to learn more.
"I did the same as you, but my third way was to use coloured chips or counters, so the students could handle the whole problem - similar to drawing, I know but I have students who prefer one way over the other."
"Very good point.  I was already on the fringe by high school so being a girl that was  good at math was just an added reason to be on the fringe.  I think it also helped that I had women mathematics teachers all through high school, even my high school calculus teacher!  More high schools need to hire women to teach math and science"
I want to emphasise that most learning takes place when you have made a mistake and have to rectify it. I will ensure that my planning in lessons and homework allows for student mistakes to be shared with the class to encourage learning from mistakes rather than diong work which they get correct but is not challenging.
The whole challenge of being a teacher is explaining the subject and doing so while encouraging the student and being careful not to further frustrate them.
pretty good idea. I love this picture and equation design.
"I'm with you. I've had moms who \couldn't do the math\"" have their kids call Dad, who was on a business trip to help with homework over the phone. Very negative modeling from Mom."""
Works for me!  :)
"They help us learn, "
I like the idea of putting up a picture of the synapse/neurons firing!  Thanks!
"I may be interested, however, it will be my first year of teaching 7th grade  so I may need time to adjust to that level after teaching 4th grade for the past five years.  How long have you taught the 7th grade?"
Those were my equations too.  It is an interesting idea to ask students to do this.
"I teach at a small school and there are only two classes of 8th graders.  We offer one class of pre-algebra and one class of algebra.  The algebra class is how you describe yours-some off the charts, many in the middle, and some that are barely able to be in there.  I try differentiate as much as I can, however, I also have five students in there that are far below algebra level and should be in the pre-algebra class.  The pre-algebra class is full so I am trying to teach pre-algebra and algebra in the same class.  At some point, don't we have to level math students?  I have read two studies that show that placing students in algebra before they are ready is really damaging to students.  With the adoption of the Common Core State Standards, we will only be offering 7th grade Common Core and 8th Grade Common Core classes so I do not thinking there will be any leveling."
"It's interesting that even a child that knew her facts was still anxious.  I agree that timed tests are horrible.  My husband used to time my son on his multiplication tables.  My son (and I ) got so anxious and frustrated that he actually got worse.  To this day, he says he is not a test taker and that he is horrible at math."
"Also in Romania have separate algebra classes with different textbooks. We teach the children trigonometry, algebra, analysis, everything separately, although everywhere use algebra to calculations."
I have found this to be true also.
"I have been using sprints in my classroom, not in place of conceptual work but as what I see as a second vital limb of math education... frequent practice of previously developed skills so that those neural pathways are developed.  I plan to make a whole library of sprints for middle school available online in a wiki."
Hi
I have recently found this on twitter!  It is really interesting and thought provoking.
"I left the number 52 out of the problem, even though I considered it, because I wasn't told it was a \deck of playing cards.\"""""
Teachers need to be told about the brain research so that they can change their expectations of children' maths ability.
"Sometimes when I get a problem wring - usually a calculation, as I am thinking three steps ahead, it embarrasses me to no end.  I have admitted this to the students ans we use it as a life lesson in persistence, checking your work and the disadvantages of working too fast... but it still slays me~"
"I'm so glad my pedantry has been validated.  It drives me mad when students use the equals sign incorrectly, and I always correct it (unless it's just a few weeks before their final exams, it's too late by then)."
I think it was interesting how the students talked about making mistakes and that everyone makes mistakes.
"I thougth about that, too... but also recalled that I needed to be informed (more than once) of the social parts of class and always being \I'm fastest! I'm fastest!\"" being intimidating to people. "
I will show a picture of the brain and how it grows when mistakes are made.
"We do not use gruping, we use differentiated instruction."
Great way to create positive feedback!  It also reaffirms their learning.
I like this.  I will try this during the opening week of school.  Thanks for sharing.
"I am LOVING this class! An elegant set-up, fascinating content, engaging lectures and assignments, and good interaction. I have one suggestion, and that is, when titling the parts of each session, they might be shown with the total number. For example, \Session 3, part 4 of 10.\"" This might help us to plan our time better, and to know how far along we are as we're working."
Hello everyone !!!!
Excellent suggestions to help us start to change our traditional classrooms. Thanks!
You may forget things you know by learning.
36 squares in the red portion
I agree.
Thanks for the link
Great idea!
"In my head I did 10 x 10 (100), 10 x 5 (50), 10 x 2 (20), and 2 x 5 (10)."
I always liked the message from the Efficacy Institute training we had in my district--Think you can. Work hard.  Get smart.
Is this related to her mindset and lack of confidence perhaps?
yay! for Delaware :)  I'm hoping to learn some great new ideas as well!
"I think it would help children to know that in areas where they are weak or struggling, God can help them grow. God asks us to give as much as we can in an attitude of courage and faith; this is demonstrated over and over in the bible, maybe hundreds of t<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>es. So I would encourage them that learning and gaining mastery of subject areas is possible with God's help as long as we try our best and maintain hope and confidence in the outcome."
"The most common question/comments I hear in the classroom are \When in my life am I ever going to need math?\"", \""Math is not my thing\"", or \""I have never been good at math.\"""""
<redacted> Thank you for the source.
It brought a smile to my face!
"I liked how Cathy asked the students to think silently about the problem, she had them pair up with their table partners, and then they shared whole group. She asked \why\"" a lot, which kept challenging them to communicate their mathematical thinking. She has a wonderfully calm demeanor. Without explicitly saying it, she honored the misconceptions (the wrong answer) which uncovered more learning opportunities for the children."""
How can it be
A great addition to the math journaling I do with my students. Love it!
"The instructor is female, that may explain her preference for male answers. In the PDF she does the same, writing about Joe an Julio more than anybody else. By taking of the mathematical mistakes of Julio she made another mistake. When she writes that 10x2.5 is not 2.50 she did not mention another \rule\"" about the decimal point in multiplication, the answer is 25.0, it follows Julio's rule and decimal rule. Professor Boaler had been attacked by male faculty at Stanford (see her website)."""
"Hi!  I am a Literacy Coach at an elementary school in Florida. My job is to provide professional development, coaching, modeling and planning in literacy to the teachers at my school.  I will be collaborating with the math coach at the school this coming school year. I am very excited about this. I am taking this course to broaden my knowledge in math.  I was always told \I didn't have math brain\"" and that shaped my beliefs about math for many, many years.  I hope to learn ways to help my teachers avoid that negativity about math through taking this course."""
With that being said many schools need to offer free tutoring.
Love it!
Seems like they have a fixed mindset!
"And, sometimes validate their own private thinking. Or, stimulate lateral thinking."
"I called all my elementary teachers by their first names (school rules!), but we definitely knew who was in charge.  Maybe it's a West Coast thing."
Modeling your own solution paths is good! Showing your own detours is excellent!
I agree with you that students should understand the real-world application of math to make the uses of it real to them and not obsolete.
One of the many concerns I have with this format!!
I agree with both of your thoughts. We need less teacher instruction and more guidance of students inquiry.
"I read a good book that said, \as a person thinks in his mind, so is he.\""  Well I agree with that statement.  If a person thinks (s)he is or is not able to learn math, (s)he is right."""
"This is a great idea. If you are in the typical American school where tracking is prevalent, how do you get away from tracking so you can have this mixed group working together. And, what do I do with the kid who can't yet comprehend the order of operations and the kid that is using trigonometry to try to solve the same problem? Did they grow this different due to our tracking?"
"Hello, I am looking forward to new concepts that I can apply when teaching math"
They were free to choose their method. The mistakes encouraged more math work (which they were ok with!)
"While there are many great ideas posted, I enjoyed yours the most. I really like how you have condensed it and laid it out.  Great work.  Thank you for sharing."
Shows that we (individuals) interpret the same information differently.
I am surprised that the students pointed out how this kind of thinking and problem solving will be essential to future math classes (i.e. fourth grade).
"Thank you so much, Professor Jo. This course was an amazing and important experience. I look forward to a next course yours."

"I also have a poster of \The Incredibles\"" to which I have added the words...\""I can do incredible things\"" At then end of each day one student gets a paper cape with the incredible thing they tried (not necessarily something they achieved)written on it. This gets stuck into their home school book so that the parent can celebrate with them."""
1. Read the question at least more than once. 
I really respect and admire your response here.
Nice! Are there any mathematicians on your poster? Or is there a similar poster for mathematicians?  Love the idea!

"I can not agree with you more - it is so very difficult to provide differentiated instruction - and ultimately the kids know whos getting what - so I like to share the knowledge, all of our students have something to offer, and sometimes they just have to work harder to keep up. Why limit our kids."
"Great post, It is true and I believe your slogan will reach the students."
I really would like problems that are specific to the skills being taught!
"This is happening to me too, and many of my friends who are also taking the course."
"I'm so use to structured formulas I don't see it. I did notice finally the cubes increase by 2,3,4 on each side of the center cube."
I hadn't thought of that but you are ABSOLUTELY right.
"I taught IMP for a year (11th & 12th grade level), and I really didn't like it.  There were a lot of bad things about my teaching experience that year.  But I felt like the IMP curriculum was *so* structured that it was inquiry in name only.  Every chapter started with a \big problem\"" (though all of them completely phony contexts... I wonder how Jo Boaler can rail about the silliness of math problems in one video and then praise IMP and the stupid orchard problem it contains in the next...).  But you are explicitly told \""don't let students solve the problem!\""  You develop all the math needed to solve it, often in quite traditional ways, and *then* go back to solve the problem."
Thank you I just joined today and was looking at this information.
Students receive negative feelings from their peers. It does not take much to reinforce (positive or negative) a child's self-esteem or belief in himself when another peer makes a simple comment.
"I might add that part of respecting others (both the teacher and students) in the class is helping them to utilize their mistakes. I often think of the coach who is very hard on players because s/he knows the players are capable of more. We should do the same in our classrooms. I want my students to know that when I provide them with feedback it is because I care about them and their learning, not because I want to point out everything that is wrong."
"SESSION 4, PART 4"
"Nick's Class. The boys were so enthusiastic about solving math problems. They said that they loved math and often I hear the second graders in my school saying how much they hate math. The boys talked about it being free, you can do what you want, meaning that you can use different combinations of operations for solving problems. No one worries about making a mistake.  It is fun to see how many different ways a problem can be solved. On student said that he liked decomposing numbers and using friendly numbers. The boys spoke highly of their teacher and  said that they would not be able to do fourth grade math without the teacher they had this year. They said they liked comparing their problems to other students' problems in the class. They liked that they could think about ideas and not follow rules."
Wonderful!  So glad to know it helped.
relationships...right on!
Show a math poster similar to one I submitted and have them reflect on it and then discuss it.
Perfect.  I intentionally (and sometimes not) make mistakes in front of the whole classroom.  That spurs some great discussion.
"This is a great idea.  I have students do this type of drawing in their science notebook and we talk about what a scientist looks like, but I never thought to do it in math."
I would like to share this information with my school district because we really need to make mindset changes.
"18 X 5 is the same as 20 X 5 = 100 - (2 X 5) = 90....Wait, isn't that an algorithm"
Bravo
"Any one is welcome to enroll in our honors classes. Honors classes have extra material or assignments, so students who enroll in honors must manage their time well. "
I also noticed this.
"It really interested me that they think of math as something free, just the opposite to what people generally says. It is wonderful that they are not afraid to make mistakes. They seem to have good confidence when it comes to math."
And where were the girls? What did they think about math?
Camai! (Alutiiq for Hello)
"This is not necessarily a stereotype. There is a definite correlation between mathematics and Aspergers. Autism is a different story. I don't believe that a stereotype exists between Autism and mathematics. It is true that some high-functioning autistic children are good at calculating but definitely not good at mathematics (relationships, patterns, symbolism). I believe you may be relating to the movie \Rain Man\"". The character that the movie is based on is incredible as far as memory retrieval is concerned. I don't recall if he has Aspergers or is autistic. Anyway, no new mathematics was created by this individual, nor any autistic individual, to the best of my knowledge. Aspergers is a different story altogether. I don't view Aspergers as being mentally deficient, but rather may be an evolutionary enhancement."""
Making mistakes is the best way to learn! Getting the right answer all the time teaches you nothing.
I agree.
This is an awesome idea!  Thanks.
"This have been a very interesting task for me.  I had written many many math exercices and problems, but to change the point of view of one of those into a problem that fits the Growth Mindset Task Framework, and also to be a very attractive, interesting, and challenging problem that helps to make sense to middle or high school students is not an easy task."
Number Stories is a good way to prepare preschoolers to future number talks.
"I would show \The Roses of Success\"" song from *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang* movie, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GND10sWq0n0 and explain that mistakes should be embraced and are encouraged...  then as the children are quite young, we would sing the song together :-)"""
Numbers are an organic part of our lives. Intuitive and flexibility in Mathematics
Ditto!
"I took it to mean there were 4 classes, each of which had 4 90 minute sessions a week for 5 weeks, so the teachers were spread between the 4 classes."
"These are middle school students, right?  It seems to me that if they can think algebraically now they will be able to understand the abstractions later.  I agree with the comments about group work and discussion not being the best way for ALL students but teacher lecturing and students working independently on problems doesn't make for good video.  Also, I think that most math education swings too far in the lecture and independent work direction."
"I work in a primary annex, kindergarten to grade 3.  Each class, except one of the k's, intentionally puts children of different ages levels in one class.  So for instance, we have grades 1/2/3 all in one class.  Or we may have a K/1 or a 2/3.  So, in order for us to cover our math curriculum, we teach our own classes a mini unit on patterns or geometry or data, etc and then group our children to teach number concepts and operations.  We group them NOT by grade, but by their conceptual understandings from previous classroom assessments.  My question is, because there are at least 2 different math curricula and more often 3 curricula that are expected to be taught if you keep you class intact,is it better for the teachers to group and teach to one set of provincially prescribed outcomes?"
I so agree... and I have a ton of gray hairs!
"Big question . . . one small part of the answer always seems to me to lie in the student's actual work. In almost any problem I can devise, there's something wonderful that a student has done. Something thoughtful or insightful or careful that's worthy of some praise. AND, there's always something that's worth constructive criticism. With some students, they easily see the \goods\"" and are in denial about the \""bads\"". With other's the opposite is true. My job is, in essence, to figure out what they naturally see and supplement it with the rest of the picture. For the majority of the kids, that means emphasizing (a) what I specifically see that's going well and (b) different ways to look at the problem that might make more sense to them. "
What a great idea!
"Many of us pay lip service to the idea of multiple perspectives and the idea that  there are multiple ways to solve a problem, but this is a gut *experience* of the truth of that. One has an opportunity to feel math differently, and also to feel the pleasure of acceptance and of being an equal with other thinkers."
"The same happens to me , but i still grade my students according to their effort and not to their score."
OK - I found it. The scroll bar above the first video of the next section is a list of icons. Each one takes you to the next step of the course. Bad UI IMHO. There should be some text links to guide users to the next step. Perhaps  links on the left sidebar under each session for each step of the course.
I also like to switch people in groups to mix it up and insert a different way of approaching the task.
"Very well stated.  We have a new math program that outlines 75 minutes work of math work each day, yet we only have a 60 minute math block."
"My question, Mervin, is where are these students receiving and then internalizing the message that they are not good at math? At what age do you think this occurs?"
Another stereotype is students with autism or Asperger's are also good at math.
"Students get negative messages everywhere.  Parents, siblings, peers, teachers--sadly, math teachers."
Every one of you can achieve the highest level in math.
It really surprised me that even top scientists did bad in math.  However it helped me to feel more relief of hearing that.  I don't have to feel ashamed and too bad after all. For long I always feel so bad because I didn't do well in math ever since high school.  No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't help myself to improve better with those scores.  I felt like a failure and I hated math ever since.
"Hello, I have completed many on-line courses; both for my master's degree in Leadership and a diploma program in Special Ed. Currently I am a Learning Support teacher at a high school and I am very interested in students gaining competence in math. It is so important to do well in math in order to have career options wide open! I look forward to gaining new insights on how to better support students, teachers, and parents."
I really like this idea. You should a video of a baby animal falling over again and again like the calf or a penguin. Once the laughing and humour part is dealt with you can then talk about persistence and what would happen in the African safari if the animal gave up. It would be dead - so let's pretend we have to keep trying like it's really important.
"I know I have a tendency to remember negative comments for a really long time. I don't think we should always PRAISE students, but giving some reasoning for constructive criticism can go a long way in helping the student stick with a subject."
In my opinion slow and steady is a better approach.  Students that are confident in their work will score better on any test because they will feel confident and will make fewer careless errors that skew the results.  Keep doing what you're doing!
Love the insight that we have teachers with 3 degrees taking care if supervisory tasks that could be done by any responsible adult earning minimum wage.
"I believe math instruction needs to be tailored to fit the needs of the entire class, but I question some of the data that negates the effect of all grouping.  Some students that are not at the same ability level with their math to handle some of the more advanced concepts or do not want to even take math could slow the progress of those that need more challenge and are ready for calculus for example."
loved that they thought maths was free andwasnt all about rules!!!
"Radio, books, even sport games. At the beginning of the year at my son's first match in a new team they told me \Do the report of the match, marks the points because there are \""too many\"" numbers and we're not able\""!"""

"I would love to pick your brain about technology.  I would love to use it to help my students, but it seems most times that I attempt to use technology it blows up in my face (not literally)."

Agreed!
I agree with your statements.
I agree  with you about enunciation.  Jo is ambiguous regarding the requirement
"Interesting point. I took an MITx course a while back (Circuits and Electronics, in the prototype offering).  I had a number of concerns about the content, but I absolutely *loved* the discussion forum interface.  There were so many tiny design choices that showed insight into the student experience.  For example, in a discussion thread, responses were sorted by number of upvotes -- so the most helpful responses always \floated\"" to the top of the thread.  "
Thanks!
I am in a special education school and we group kids based on ability but I feel that it is hard to place those board line kids

I would love to know the answer to this question.  Great thinking!
"Hello all,"
"Pam, I love how you worded your thoughts."
"Hi, I have read the other posts regarding feedback but am still a little confused. I am grading more than the allocated number. In my progress bar I can see some of the scores are 0/1 and some 1/1. How do I know whether the 0/1 means that my response was rubbish, or whether it is yet to be marked? And also the ones that are marked 1/1, how do I see the peer feedback? Help!"
I'm not a bit surprised by the damage done to Ms Parry.

"I like your analogy to working out, making a muscle stronger with exercise. We certainly expect to miss a few shots, strike out once in a while, or just have an off day.  Why not have the same relationship to math? "

"Good evening (at least in Australia) I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> & I teach High School maths (11 - 18 yrs old)in rural Bathurst, NSW, Australia.

I believe that two main points are: visualization and abstraction. It requires some thought to get the 3 x 3 case. Then in considering the 10 x 10 we start to see how the problem can be abstracted or generalized to n x n case.  There is also at least one way to check to see if your answer is consistent.
"Before multiplying by 12, I broke apart the 15 into a ten and a five. I started with 12x10=120 and then 12x5=60 and added those two sums together to get 180."

"Girls and students of color are more impacted by changing their mindset because society has controlled them by getting them to buy into the stereotypes, a fixed mindset, in so many areas of their lives. When their mindset changes, they break free and regain possibilities for themselves."
"I teach and have done so for several years now that the equal symbol means \is the same as\"".  In fact when I read a math problem I hardly ever say \""equals\"", I would say 4+3 \""is the same as\"" (while using the = symbol to represent those words) _____________."""
"I heard a great quote: \Failure is not trying, its not the outcome.\"""""
"Currently in Australia, most schools still group students according to ability. What's worse is that the current education system in Australia is horrendous. There is a trend that is causing the mass exodus of children being moved towards 'better' schools where they supposedly would receive a better education. What this means is that there are entire schools are full of fixed mindset students who have been given the label of low ability and expectations that follow."
I have noticed a trend that students and parents want to opt down to a lower track to maintain a grade point average or not work as hard.  This year I have been trying to challenge the fixed mind set that many of my students exhibit.  Their initial reaction when presented with challenging open-ended tasks is that it is too difficult for them.  This course has provided me with fuel to encourage and help them change that mindset however it is not easy.  The counselors at my school in many cases are enabling students when they allow a student with an A or a B to switch to the easier track that involves more direct instruction and simple memorization.

(To an adult class)
"I had a student come into 9th grade algebra having failed 8th grade pre-algebra.  Instead of having her daughter repeat 8th grade, the mother put her daughter on a credit recover system (A+), and brought her to me that the start of 9th grade and said, \he can help you\"".  She rose to the top of the class, and earned perfect scores on 5 tests in a row!  Another student came to me having demonstrated proficiency in 8th grade pre-algebra, and his mom tried to find a different teacher when her son complained that I wouldn't let him do anything.  She ended up leaving him in my class, but the message had already been sent to her son that I was not a good teacher.  He did not demonstrate proficiency on the algebra test at the end of the year.  Attitude has a large impact in all this."""
"Kids know who the lower and high ability kids are due to grouping.  Teachers disguise it by labeling it the green or triangle group, but kids know.  I used a different approach while teaching social studies to 5th graders this year and had tremendous results.  All students were high ability thinkers and thought of themselves as \good\"" at social studies by the end of the year.  Grouping by ability should really stop because it is more in what expectation is held that students believe they can achieve success."""
I posted mine the other day just after the video.  Here is the link to mine:
"I'd tell my students that mistakes create great thinkers. Look at all the mistakes inventors have to make before they arrive at the one thing they become famous for, like, Edison and the light bulb.  Mistakes helps the brain to grow and growth is a good thing."

From peers and parents who had difficult experiences.
"My school does the same, where in the elementary level the students are divided into classrooms with mixed abilities and we teach using differentiation, and in the middle and high school the students are placed into classrooms according to ability. However, the ability is determined from the score they receive from the NECAP test. If the child does not do well taking tests, this can result in being placed in a wrong class, and can really devastate a child and discourage them. (I have seen this)."
"It's surprising to think of math as free, as something you can do your own way.  I was surprised that they expected to do badly in 4th grade if there weren't learning to use their own methods."
"This research opens up math to all students. However, the hardest thing is putting research into practice - how to bridge the gap between theory and practice??"
"I think telling them up front, everyone is born with the ability to learn how to do maths.  Giving them the message that mistakes are crucial to learning and without them we are wasting our time in the classroom.  Explain at the outset that the goal is to be working outside our comfort zone at all times, if it is easy we are not learning anything."
"Not sure it's \easier\"" but it's \""another\"" way. For some intuition goes one way, for others another way. Don't need that formula (that I can't remember, and it doesn't make sense to me!)"""
WOW!  I am super excited about using the dot cards in a number talk.  What a great entry point in teaching students the routines of a number talk without overwhelming anyone with numbers!  It also demonstrates how to add on to another persons ideas.  It demonstrates how a teacher can make a visual and then put equations to describe the mathematical thinking of the students.  I could go on and on!
I think the correct link to the website is:
"That's true that personalities play a big role.  In Kindergarten I have students work in pairs a lot at different activities and the number one factor I have to look at is how the two will work together. If they enjoy being together, then there are good results."
"Thanks <redacted> and <redacted> - your comments were right along my line of thinking. I'm a middle and high school teacher and I erroneously thought that students started to gain the \can't do\"" math around grade 5 or 6 - due to the fact that the material gets more abstract (this is where algebraic ideas generally begin in curricula). Boy was I in for a shock when I interviewed a 5-year old who said she was bad at math! FIVE?? With all I have learned this year, this isn't so surprising anymore, but is all the more disheartening. I believe that \""struggle\"" - mentioned by <redacted> -  is something that needs to be seen in a more positive light - as PART of the learning process. So often teachers and parents are quick to \""rescue\"" a child from a perceived struggle rather than allow students to let their intuition loose on a problem. This can be one of many ways, as <redacted> says, that teacher beliefs can influence the non-verbal ways they communicate that a students can't do math."""
"-parents, teachers, society place more value in grades than effort"
This will be year 2 of iPad pilot for me. One of my 8th grade sections has 1:1 ipads and we're *also* learning as we go.
"I understand your concerns.  In my grade six class I have 30 students of all different abilities.  It can be difficult some days to make sure everyone is progressing along their own personal continuum.  Some days I allow students to choose their own groups to work through problems and other days I direct students to pairings which may be more beneficial then their friends.  Approximately 70% of my students tend to choose their group wisely; and I do not mean based on ability, more importantly, the ability to cooperate together.  The best discussions tend to come from students who are of mixed ability and they really talk through the problems.  Unfortunately 30% of my students need help cooperating with their peers.  I have to remind them how to listen and share respectively.  For a few students it takes most of the class just to settle into a group and start the problem, while others finish the work in no time.  Facility these classes can be challenging but it can also be extremely rewarding."
"The gun goes off!  All runners are quick off the marks with C in the lead, close behind are A and B with A having a slight lead over B.  C is still ahead."
I didn't see that either.
It_s certainly true what you say. The way maths are taugth is fundamental in many ways.
"I think that the dot representation allows people to break free of the rules that are associated with numbers and think along more flexible lines. The question \What do you see\"" rather than \""what is the answer\"" is important here. "
"Back in the day, when I was in school :), I remember vividly being in the \high\"" math group.  Sure, this helped me, but what did it do for the other students in the \""middle\"" and \""low\"" groups?  Fast forward 30 years.  I have been teaching for 22 years - from K-8, \""regular\"" ed to special ed.  I am currently at a school that chose to ability group the students this year.  I was against it from the start (and still am), but I was overruled.  I guess I should have done some extra homework to find the studies on ability grouping...sigh.  It's hard enough to get teachers \""off the textbook\"" and have their students THINK.  Now I see it's even MORE important because of the way my school set up the classes."""
The students did not feel compeled to use only one method. They liked to decomopose and add numbers. They like to think of ways to solve a problem. I loved the idea of friendly numbers - numbers that you could combine easily. They weren't afraid to make a mistake in class. They saw that as an opportunity for the others in the class to help them. This was a community learning environment where there was give and take among the students. They worked well together. They really liked their teacher and felt like he was helping them.It was good to see young students so excited about learning math.
(To the tune of Frere Jacques)  
"Yes, my 6th graders just want to jump in and solve the problem. Looking for numbers to push around and operations that can be attached without any reasoning or sense making_it_s just"
I would like to be able to check both of the last two responses.
I was intrigued when the one student said math is like free.  You can do whatever you want.  there's different ways to do things and they never saw that before the math talks.  I liked the use of the term friendly numbers.
Math is a great discipline. Students like when it is used in the practical issues that are relevant in real life. We can collaborate on a book with such problems?
"One message I'd like to share with my students is to be able to share at least one solid connection  or question about what they hear from other students in class. It might be a shared frustration, or a new way of looking an a concept, a shared misconception, or a question about an idea or approach used by another student. It can be very powerful when a kid admits that they have wondered that some thing, or been stuck in the same area, as someone else. It can also help students identify where we teachers aren't providing the resources the kids need!"
"Every mistake we make is a chance to grow and learn more. If we aren't making mistakes in class, we aren't learning."
I wish I had the online tools to create this. Since I don't I will explain. I would create a poster with the following :
"This seems like an approach that may address my primary challenge with mixed ability grouping.  I love teaching to a heterogeneous, mixed group, challenging them with real mathematical thinking.  But I do invariably encounter students who need more focused help to grasp the concepts."
"Previously, I have been able to enter all of my responses; however, on response 6.4, when I click on the box to enter my response, the box goes dead, develops a red border, and I am unable to enter a response."
"While tutoring my student last week, I watched him struggle through the process of subtracting across the zeros and become overwhelmed and frustrated.  His reward for getting through one problem was to start another.  When reflecting on the session, I realized I had experienced this exact scenario!  Now I was duplicating it.  Next time we went to Khan math online.  We watched together and learned a much better process.  My student learned there is more than one method to solve hard problems, and that his teacher is a student."
"Dale, I wrote about what I noticed in parent conferences as well. Your point about how parents can also exhibit negative attitudes toward approaches which support math understanding is so true!"
"Working smarter means allowing your brain the chance to make a mistake, learn from your mistake, and then achieve from your mistake."
I agree.  Cathy modeled very well how to appropriately handle mistakes in the classroom in a positive way.  Joe's mistake became a learning opportunity.
"This activity is more of an attempt to raise self-awareness for the instructor, but could be extended to include students. Prior to mathematics class, put two empty cans or jars bearing the labels male and female somewhere in the classroom where they are easy to access. Have a bag of beans, paper clips, pennies, or other small objects near the jars. During class, each time you interact with a student place a bean in the appropriate jar according to the gender of the student(s) with whom you were interacting. Which gender gets the most interaction? How could you further stratify the data? How about paying attention to the length of interactions, the topic of interaction, and/or the tone of interaction. Where's the math? Students could analyze this data (if you as a teacher are willing to model vulnerability), and in so doing, their awareness would be raised about their own behavior. Is there any evidence of inequity? If so, what can be done about it? What do they believe about themselves and each other when it comes to mathematical ability? How does their behavior reflect their beliefs? Can it be modified to support a positive belief?"
"I think, mainly, students don't learm because of the methods."
"Hello everyone.  I am a high school English as a Second Language teacher in Quincy, Massachusetts.  I am excited about learning how to teach yet another language!"
Just putting kids in the same group won't keep them from recognizing that some kids are very good at math an others are terrible.  I've seen 5th grade classrooms where some kids are working through high school algebra texts and others have not mastered their times tables yet.
"Like many others here, I believe students often hear from their parents that math is hard, and that they didn't \get it\"" when they were students, so it is ok not to do well."""
"I wanted to post about 2 questions in the survey that really hit home with me.  It was never my intention to become a math teacher.  I struggled in math in middle school and in high school.  Math was the only subject I can remember a teacher yelling at me for not understanding and kicking me out of his classroom for being too social.  Yet, here I am entering my 23rd year of teaching and teaching a Pre AP precalculus class.  Each year I present my students with a survey.  I have taught all levels of math.  The most prominent response that comes from my students is that they did not like or think they were good at math until they came to my class.  They may still not like math, but they are appreciative of it and took something with them.  That is a success in my book.  I don't believe that someone 'cannot' learn math."
"I often hear statements from my student's parents \Oh, I was never any good at math\"" or \""I can't help my student because I am not good at math\"". Math seems to scare a lot of people. I think it is because so much attention and time has been devoted to memorization of facts and algorithms. (Many of which can be preformed by a simple calculator). In addition, these facts must be mastered by a certain age and in a set amount of time. This has created a lot of anxiety for students that cannot produce the math facts quickly."""
"Melissa, please do not let your professors discourage you. We need you! We need enthusiastic teachers who are open to trying to teach in a different way. You are the future. :-)"
It almost hurts when I have students who could care less about the proof of something or why one thing works and they ask just how to do the problem.  And they're content to try to memorize steps even though the motivation for the problem is far my interesting and helpful.  It's like my own students pressure me into turning the class into a bunch of boring steps.  It really is sad.
"What I found surprising was that the male students talked about how math was \free.\""  I thought it was surprising because the word free is an interesting choice for students to use when they describe math.  Wouldn't it be great if all students saw math as free instead of rules to follow.  There would be so much more understanding if that were to happen."""
"I have never used dot cards before, but I liked them.  It really showed various ways of solving a problem where one way really wasn't any \better\"" than another.  It is important to see how every one visualizes things differently, but it is okay!  Also, I liked at the end having the students recognize the similarities in their thinking.  There was overlap even though they all did it a different way."""
"I agree!  I wish Jo would go back and talk to him or email the teacher and try to get some responses to share.  This would be very instructive, like a formative assessment that we could use to inform instruction."
I have a little perfectionist in my homeschool as well.  He HATES mistakes.  We have used humor and some of this idea of mistakes already which does help but hope to add upon what we already do.  Good Luck!
"I like your equation! I also like that you are going to promote growth mindsets by visiting classrooms.  Finally, that math brain sticker is a great idea!"
The question wasn't in itself open ended but the teacher turned it into an open ended process. The pupils would have a much deeper understanding of what is to divide another number by a fraction having conceptualised it themselves.
"I share your concern regarding structure.  Although students may come to appreciate math, I am afraid that the connections we want them to make following a \fun and engaging\"" problem/project will not be made, and the time expended will be lost."""
I was viewing it as stacks and then suddenly saw the word shape.
"I agree, classes would need to be smaller? And I worry that a child who is finding it really hard will feel just as negative and 'bad at maths' in a class dominated by high flyers as they would in a low set?"
I agree with you.  A friend's adopted son from Korea said that people at school have told him he is smart (his parents were careful not to say this) and he feels now he shouldn't have to study because only people who aren't smart have to study.  I think this boy needs more challenge.
"I teach in 8th grade math in a middle school in a large district.  Not only do we have the three levels: Math 8, Algebra and Geometry.  We also take a Math 8 class, put in all the IEPs and add a special education teacher and call it team taught.  Students walk in the first day of school, see the extra person in the class and decide they're the \dumb class\"".  A few will even try to move to a different Math 8 class.  Don't get me wrong - I love co-teaching and working with another teacher in a classroom, but I really worry about the messages we're sending students."""
"What is to be gained?   Allows students to see that there are many ways to approach a problem.  The fact that it is dots and not something which is \mathematical\"" means that some students who might otherwise feel anxious will be able to participate more easily.  Why are they important?  Sets the tone for the class in doing this kind of work together, in a very none threatening manner.  (I have had technological difficulties, I am hoping this isn't my second or third response to this question.  If it is I apologize)."""
"To help them put their guard down, I would regularly share with my class my own mistakes, even those not having to do with math:driving, cooking, gardening...topics they can completely relate to.  I'd share with the class my own learning process of getting to where I am today.  I'm afraid that high school students are very worried about fitting in and being made fun of.  I think we have to set the example that we all make mistakes and learn from them.  It cannot be a singular message on day one.  It has to be a continual way of life throughout the school year (calendar year!)"
None of the problems I did for the last hour and a half seem to be recorded!!!! What should I do???
"Human Beings like to please others. We are wired this way. Children want to please their parents, that is why they cry when they get in trouble. This transfers very well to the classroom. If students have been brought up at an early age to please others. Your students will want to please you. Giving them one small sentence that tells them how proud you are of them or even one small gesture made for them will make a difference. They will remember that you were pleased with how they were doing or what they did and want to continue to do so even years later."
*I can grow my brain by making mistakes
"Hi.  I am a former homeschool teacher and future public K-8 (student teaching in September) in Bellingham, WA.  I am married to an awesome high school math teacher who is also taking this course. Looking forward to learning more about teaching math!"
"I think it was great that they were all excited about math. They brought up words I haven't thought of using... like decomposing and friendly numbers. I like how they noticed that math is freeing, especially with the math talks. Also, I like how they commented that it was okay to make mistakes."
The message I would like to give is that success in Maths is available to all students - even if you haven't ever experienced success in Maths before. The secret to success is through Trial and Error and making mistakes and thereby growing your brain.
"Sorry to repeat, but the saying you are free to do what you want was surprising to me.  They didn't say, that Nick did not help them, they had enough confidence in themselves to try things out.  I was also surprised by the use of the word decompose. Not only are they gaining number sense, but they are also describing it in mathematical terms."
"Fearlessly welcoming mistakes and proactively learning from them is the surefire way to a smarter brain.  If you're getting it all right, all of the time, I'm not doing my job as a teacher.  I want you to be much smarter than when you first started here, so you bet that I will give you rich tasks that will allow you to make mistakes and learn productively from them."
1) Cathy gives enough time for students to think individually.
1.  Parents place so much emphasis on grades that students are afraid to fail.
"I teach at a high school where direct instruction is widely believed to be the best method of teaching, not just by teachers and administrators, but also by students and parents.  I'm contemplating seeing if I can get my class list early and inviting parents to join this class.  Of course, this could backfire like when I showed \Stand and Deliver\"" to my class 25 years ago and students said they wished they had Escalante for a teacher.  Parents might all wish their children had Jo.  Thoughts?"""
"I have been doing major housecleaning this summer and have found some of my son's journals from his middle school days.  I have thoroughly enjoyed reading some of his entries, especially the several mentions of how he loved to learn. I have had students tell me that they have used the previous years journals to help them solve problems in later years. Your students may be able to use their journals to help chart their growth in thinking or abilities over a school year."
"Still can not get it to work, but I read the script. I was not when one interview stop and another one started though."
i agree. top students see the connection between numbers and work the numbers in a variety of ways.  they also see how procedures tie to other procedures.  i see additions tie to multiplication and subtraction and with a stretch to division.
Would it be correct to say that growth mindset can be perceived as one of the components of general intelligence (innate ability) that regulates the function and development of different domains of intelligence?
"Since I teach only girls I know that there are those who have always seen themselves as smart and those who say they have to work hard for their grades. They are use to getting good grades easily. I have some who told me that they have never studied before for a math test. These are the ones whose confidence is shaken when they do not do well on a test. They have to re-evaluate themselves and then decide that maybe this isn't their subject. They have preconceived notions about what they are good at and what they can do. If they start to receive lower grades, they see themselves as stupid."
When I made math mistakes I felted like I wasn't as good at math as my peers.  But I viewed math as a puzzle to solve and like a detective I kept on until I solved problems  correctly.
"I have to be honest, I am a \math person\"", but disliked and struggled with geometry.  However, I adored doing algebra and still think that statistics in college was my favorite course EVER!"
Grouping students by abilities or not. I had 29 students this year. I am not sure whether they all would have received equal and fair teaching had I not grouped them. I not really sure they were really by levels but good groups. It has been really advantageous because I can give all the students more support and tailor the learning level which does not frustration them. Some the students at higher-level students are sometimes left to work on their own while I work more closely with the lower ability students. When the students are grouped together by ability the teacher is able to work more closely with the students.  There are pros and cons to ability grouping. I do think that when low-level students are put with high level students they are able to learn from them.I do think that having a growth mind set for all students helped the most.
"I have completed all the tasks for Session 1 and 2; but my Progress shows some tasks not scored; therefore, my Progress is showing less than 100%. How can I check if my work was received when submitted. Also, can we get copies of our responses to your questions?"
Because by doing that you've helped us learn something today. You've helped our brains grow. Let's keep making them!
Awesome!  Our brains do need exercise and this will change the mindset of most people.  We want our students and own children to learn more not make perfect on everything and become stagnant.
"Unfortunately, I think they may be getting those messages in the classroom.  At the school I work in, we strive to teach to the multiple intelligences.  Over the years, we have had kids identify their strengths and areas in which they need to work harder.  In reflecting, I realize I have perpetuated the idea of being \math smart\"" or \""word smart\"" etc.  "
Maths is the most intuitive thing on the planet and therefore inherently easy. Problems occur whe formulas are introduced with fixed rules and people stop acting intuitively. He says it is vital to have an emotional attachment to the maths.
This activity has multiple access points allowing all learners to engage and participate.  It promotes flexibility and being able to decompose numbers which consequently develops number sense.
"Why do we have to go through the \learning how to grade\"" section EVERY time we do the peer grading/discussion.  It's kind of annoying."""

"Students could think about money: One student could think about quarters, loonies (The Canadian one-dollar coin) and toonies (The Canadian two-dollar coin). A loonie is 100 ¡ª, which means 100%. 25¡ª of 100 ¡ª is the 25%. If a toonie is the double of a loonie, then the 25% must be the double of 25¡ª. So 25% of 200 is 50. Another student could think that when you have 4 quarters you make a dollar, so a dollar divided into 4 parts is a 25 (a quarter of it). If we divide 200 into 4 parts the answer will also be a quarter of it. So 200/4=50."
"There is a big difference between a mistake, 2*3=5, and a misunderstanding, (-3)^2=-9.  Distinguishing betweeen these, mistakes and misunderstandings is important for really learning.  I am frequently asked if an answer is wrong, like 6/8 after doing much computation, the answer is not yes or no in this case.  What I say is you are not finished.  The work you have done to this point is correct now you just need to finish it up.  There are many levels of correctness in a question and guidance with acknowledgement of what needs correcting is essential to effectively teaching mathematics.  Tests that only focus on answers will always fail students as learning tools."
"RETAINING the math is the biggest obstacle for most students.  I haven't met a student yet that is just completely incapable of learning math.  The biggest obstacle I have found is that these students do not RETAIN the math concepts/skill after they have learned it.  At some point they are able to show mastery on a skill or concept, but weeks or months down the road they cannot remember how do it now.  The inverse of this situation is also true, in that my brightest math students are the ones that can/do retain all their previous math learning and can recall it quickly with little reteaching."
"I don't remember any specific math mistakes, but I do remember that I liked to get tests back with the correct answer, so that I could look through my work and find my mistake.  I liked math mainly because it was the only class that challenged my mind.  I looked at mistakes as a way to see potential problems in the future, and avoid them.  I learned to estimate to see if my answers were even close."
"I've had good success grouping kids with mixed abilities too, but you really have to be conscious of class culture and providing a structure for their interaction."
"Unfortunately, this is very true. So, we need to educate our parents - sometimes we do this through our students. They are the messengers and if we can convince them, and they actually can fell the difference, they experience this learning mind-set because we have exposed them to this way of thinking because we have exposed them to tasks that are learning focused, our students become our advocates. This is powerful!"
"I think we are getting off on a tangent worrying about people who learn at different rates meaning that we need to give students different tasks.  What I hear from this class is that we need to come up with tasks that have low entry points but high ceilings.  This way everyone can learn something from the doing the same task at the same time, even though they are all working at different rates. Then we will all hopefully learn from each other during the class discussion section of the lesson where we discuss different methods and similarities. You're right, though, it would be nearly impossible if everyone was working on something different based on \ability\"".  This is the reason for ability groupings, but even in ability grouped classes very few people work at exactly the same rate, you still have your faster and slower students."""
I frequently do number talks with elementary students and it is truly amazing the responses students come up with.  The number talks open students mind to another way of looking at a problem.
Do not be afraid of confusion.  That is your brains way to trying to figure things out....if you are confused you are on the brink of knowing something new.
"I don't feel there is just a single reason, but teaching methodology stands out. I once dropped a math class after much struggling.  Despite feeling discouraged, I later took the class with the same text book, but a different instructor--it made all the difference. The different style and explanation clicked for me."
"It seems to me that many kids get place in to lower tracks because they have behavior problems.  I am not a teacher, but when I was in school this was the case.  I was glad not to be in those classes where there were a lot fights both verbal and physical."
"Wow!  What a fun way to help children see that they can stop and think about the problem before trying shout out an answer.  I am in \K\"", and we have always collaborated during math congress/debrief/discuss.  When I have had the children work in small groups together to solve a problem, it has been gratifying. I agree with all of you that collaboration is wonderful for our kids (not just teachers). I know that my students do like to have great visuals, movement, and chants/songs to help them remember something new like the \""mathematical thinking process\"".  I am so excited to introduce this to my children in September!"""
"I completed all questions, surveys, etc in Session 1 but my \Progress\"" still reflects 5/7."""
"I read this really great article last year that compared math and reading. It started with the scenario of a dinner party. One person at the party mentions that they can not do math. Everyone else seemingly chimes in and laughs about how much they hated math in school and how they were never very good at it either. Unfortunately, this seems normal. Now go back to the dinner party. Someone says, \I can't read.\"" Whose laughing now? This isn't funny. So why is it okay for everyone to be bad at math but it is not okay for just one person not to be able to read? "
"From a dot card number talk people can learn how to break information up in order to solve a problem. Also, people can learn different methods and see the different ways to solve a problem.  This is important so that everyone can gain ideas from others and learn from others possible ways to solve problems."
I am not clear on what is being proposed in these questions.  ---  How important do you think it is for students: To take the course in groups? How important do you think it is for students: To be grouped through the platform? To be connected in classrooms?
"I work in an international school and grouping is cheaper. The teacher does not need to spend as much time preparing or even teaching in the classroom. A quick lesson and then they are on to their email while the kids practise. Saturday Morning busy work is past papers. Parents want the numbers and chose the school based on numbers. The school is part of an international group that makes a tremendous amount of money. Even the college counseling is rated on a list of \top schools\"". "
"It astounds me that parents will tell me that their child struggles with math because they did, like it is totally an inherited trait, and without it the situation is hopeless."
How very cool to hear that in math class you are free to do whatever you want with the numbers. I don't think there are very many classes in my district where kids would describe math that way. 
"1-She focus in her classroom on a particular norme that's about encouraging students to make sense to solve math problems.Also, she kept going repeating\why does this make sense?_ "
"some students get the negative messages about math from their own teachers, especially at the elementary levels. These messages do not have to be verbal messages. They could be attitude towards math."
"Agreed that this number talk encourages flexibility and it does not focus on the \right\"" answer.  Instead Cathy focused on the kind of thinking each student did with great emphasis and support on the mistake made by Joe."""
"I have a friend who, in high school, was told by her guidance counselor that she did not need to take any more math because she \probably would not go to college.  She should just go to community college.\""  Well, thankfully she ignored him... she came from a home with a disabled dad, and poverty... but she graduated university with honors and a major in computer science and minor in Russian linguistics.  Not bad, eh?  She took Calculus anyway in high school, against the guidance counselor's advice."""
I think it is important to start with shapes instead of numbers for a number talk to introduce students to the process that will be used for the number talks without worrying about a math problem as well.
A balance would be good.  One on one and group.  I think it's good to look and explore on your own and also to see how others think and explore.  It gives you balance.
"They provide a refreshing yet non-threatening way to encourage thought around numbers. It allows students to realize their previously unrecognized capability with numbers, to see that there can be a number of ways to approach a problem, and to understand that creativity is a natural part of it all. Such an approach can help students to begin to really think differently and more positively about math."
"I feel once the risk taking environment has been made to feel safe, students will be more willing to allow their incorrect papers to be viewed by the whole class. I have always asked the students, and sometimes they don't want to have others view their work. Other times they are willing. Many times, I have taken a vote where the class decides if I choose a random paper but don't show the name. Both strategies have worked well. It may be due to the child having the option to say yes or no."
"I don't think the Sports and the Math examples are really that different -- we don't want, and don't have, everyone at the same skill level in sports and I don't think that is desired in a math (or any academic) class either. We want the stars, the best and brightest, to be at the top, learning the most and becoming the best at their skill/talent/ability they can be."
"I though the boys were very open and honest about how they felt about math. They used \free\"" frequently. I enjoyed how quickly and eagerly they replied to do you like math. Wouldn't it be nice if that eagerness and love of math followed them up through the grades? I was also happy to hear the vocabulary \""decomposing numbers\"". That language and strategy is clearly being modeled for them."""
"Actually, I don't see a problem with what you just described. At some point, I will sometimes give students a 'challenge question' that will show me who is ready to work ahead. Doing it this way, the students who moves ahead will not always be the same, but will change from one day to the next, depending on who understands well."
"I often ask my kindergarteners to 'explain their thinking' or 'if there is another way to get the answer' or 'how do you know?'  Even little ones are able to explain how they figured it out and debate the best ways to do things if you never accept, \I know it because I am smart\"""""
"I have always been in favor of grouping.  I had a very bad experience in high school where I felt as if I was wasting my time in my social studies classes.  Those classes were not grouped and the teachers expectations were very low for all of us.  I understand that she was dealing with students that ranged from the valedictorian of the class to those who were basically illiterate.  However the work that was given was probably on an elementary level.  The message that I received as a student was \memorize this for the test\"". In the classes that were ability grouped the work was more rigorous.  So teacher expectation plays a big role in not grouping.  I understand what the studies are showing and I wish I could be more positive about eliminating grouping, but I really do not want my daughter to experience the same scenario that I did in high school."""
"I have never heard of this contract, however, I have seen and felt it in action.  My first year as a teacher (thinking of my math class) I had the \low\"" differentiated math group, and they were so very used to being spoon fed.  I hated that idea.  I wanted them to have a healthy struggle and work on their own.  They just about fell apart.  They came to me ALWAYS being spoon fed. I noticed the Instructional Assistant assigned to my class with the \""low\"" kids giving them all the help they wanted.  They had figured out that if they just call Miss Sally (changed the name to protect the innocent) over, she would help them because me, teacher, obviously was not going to.  This was frustrating.  I had a talk with the IA and things improved.  But I could see that at first, until I explained to the class that is was okay to struggle and make mistakes, that they were in a safe place and we were all learning together, they thought I had reneged on this so-called DUTY of mine to feed them the answer."""
Teaching methods and the lack of foundational background.
"Am I the only one who couldn't think of three ways to represent this?  I could do an equation, and \drawings\"" using \""o\"" for rocks, but after a day of a seminar class and four hours of sleep, due to house guests, I think I am a little fried.  But I really enjoy the conceptual thinking of this class!"""
"Wow, I kind of expected answers like that, but I was still surprised and quite impressed with the clarity of the students comments. They pointed out each advantage that the \theory\"" of this style offers, the creativity in it, the multitude of possible solutions, the validity of all solutions, the beauty of making mistakes, it was just astounding how much they already understood, and obviously the effect of all this was visible in such that the students really liked what they were doing: Math"""
"I think you're right when you say that kids start to develop a fixed mindset when they are put in a certain track. Being put in a low track is particularly damaging fora student who has other experience success in math. I had the opportunity to work in a mixed ability group classroom and I saw how this mixed interaction benefited those students who you would consider low. When sharing strategies, the low ability students would learn other strategies from others and learn new ways to approach math problems."
It is fascinating to see how differently people think ... some methods seem very protracted!
"I teach first grade. I don't group students in Math, but that's mostly because we have to use a fixed curriculum (Everyday Math) to teach and we don't have the liberty of creating our own lessons. EM doesn't have much cooperative or group learning going on. Most of the time, the teacher delivers the day's lesson, and students go and do a page in their math books. The only time cooperation and mixed ability grouping happens is when they play math games in pairs, and even then, they cooperate to practice a math skill, not to solve a challenging problem. I wonder how teachers in schools that have a prescribed curriculum do mixed ability learning and group work? "
This is the first strategy I would've leaned towards too.
The video shows that the students weren't the least bit initimidated by the math because they felt they had free expression to attempt the problem.
"I have a very interesting format that I use for my students interactive math journals. I give them the notes - starting with their goal at the top. Then, the next session \what do you know about the goal\"" requires student to give a few lines or ideas about what they already know. Then we share them as a class. The next session is \""What you need to know\"" where I give them important vocabulary or previously learned concepts that connect to what we are learning. Then  we go over examples. This is all on the left hand side. On the right hand sides, students use their imaginations and creativity to design a \""study\"" page that they will use for preparing for tests and doing their homework. Sometimes they are funny, comics, and sometimes they are just the rules written in order. They put a stop light at the top corner, and color in red for lost, yellow for sort of get it, and green for ready to go, so when I do a check in with them, I can see if they need more work or not."""
You are both right.  How do we measure students to show their growth without to parents and schools.   Just because I said this child knows how to solve many problems is not enough for administrators who are trying to show what students learn.  This particularly true in the lower grades since parents are worried that their children will not be prepared to move ahead.   I would prefer to do an assessment that is both learning and showing how what the child knows.  The problem is that this hard to compare to everyone else and children are not consistent in their performance on any given day.  Also when children go home and can not do an assignment because of either the parent wants the child to do it one way or a child just wants to quickly finish the assignment so can not be bothered with taking the time to think as he might have done in school.  The reaction from a parent is often that the assignment is too hard or child never learned anything which means the assessment means nothing.   We are in a bind if we always compare and not allow for children to take a risk.
"Most important think, is change chip and brianswsh and reset for get aptitude for  learning maths,as today new methods offrering learn math for differents ways."
First you separate 18 as 10 +8. Then you multiply mentally 10x5=50 and 8x5=40. At last you add up The results: 50+40=90
Mistakes are not only our friends they are our teachers.
I am amazed how this example lead them to write numbers similar to Mayan numerals. They need more elaboration but is the number sense that matters here.
How remarkable that the very first response that came to the first speakers mind before the conversation ensued was that math is free!
"Does your school group in this manner due to results on state testing? The people who need to hear all this information are those non-educators who make the laws that students and teachers must perform at Level X in order to succeed. Until we convince them, we will all be stuck."
I was amazed at their fluent use of the words decompose and friendly numbers.  It shows that a lot of familiarity has been developed.  I would have loved to see an earlier session of this class in which these strategies were initially being taught.
"Doing a dot-card number talk can help people see that there are multiple ways to represent the same numbers and the same processes.  Also, that not everyone sees things in the same way.  What an amazing gift to give to the students!"
I like the initial reflection of less than 3 hours.
I had never seen this before but I see how wonderfully it ties in with our goal to help students think about how they think and how they learn. It reinforces as well that there are many ways to be right and encourages flexible thinking - very growth mindset focused.
"I find that the grouping has really altered my classroom and we have really lost the borderline student.  Our district has begun to make specialized programs and is to date pulling for 3 programs from the general population right before they enter my classroom.  Each group is different, one group is high level math ability - testing to get in, on group is random - you have to apply (so motivated) and the third group is an interview process (again motivated students) and they are looking at making yet a fourth group in two years.  Although I feel that this is wonderful for the small percentage of students that this serves, I have seen negative impacts on the students that remain.  The role models, students that are high achieving, students that are motivated, are missing and students that are not solid are becoming the role models."
"Hi everyone. I was thinking it would be great if we could crowdsource creating a \Mathematical Thinking Process\"" poster based on Professor's <redacted> work as shown in [Session 6, Part 3][1]. Unfortunately, my design ability is, well, not so great. So [here's what I started][2], but I would love if someone with a bit more creativity jumped in and made it much better."
"number one is broken, two and three work currently.  They are fixing number one"
"Still don't get it.  Why would it take less than two hours when one person takes longer than 3 hours and would slow the work down?  Sure, two people can do more than one, but Sam is slow."
I find these last few segments of the material relate very closely to Sir Ken Robinson's talk on [How to Change Education - from the ground up][1]. He has for a while now been talking about changing education paradigms and I think these approaches to maths teaching are a perfect example of how that is happening.
I agree about testing and math timed tests. It does too much damage to our students' confidence and doesn't emphasize the more important mathematical practices like perseverance during problem solving.
"I teach at a private school and we have always had tracking in the middle school and high school levels. Until this past year, we also had tracking at the elementary level. When I came to the school I brought up how ability grouping at the elementary level in subjects like math is really kind of pointless. Many of the students who are deemed \gifted\"" at the elementary level are those that are good at math facts, not math reasoning/thinking. It's these same students who are later held up in mathematics at the middle school or high school level where more thinking is involved. I teach at the middle school level, and we have tracked students for the upcoming school year and as I am working to prepare for this, I am working to set expectations for each set of students that will challenge each set of students. The students at each grade level are learning the same material, but at different paces. I want to expect the same end goal for each set, but take the expectation and spread it out over the time needed for each set of students to understand and make sense of the material on their own. I am really excited about this because I have hopes that I will see lots of growth for both groups and I challenge them to reach something that they will see as unreachable at the time."""
"I answered a,b, and d. I believe the foundation in math is lacking. As a third grade teacher, each year I get a new group of students who are performing at a 1st through beginning 2nd grade level in math. I think part of this problem is because many of my colleagues are insecure with math themselves. I know this because they have vocalized this concern with me at math trainings. "

"The only experience that I can offer is the field that I intend to enter:  Bilingual Education.  In one class the groups are changed weekly, and this seems to draw out different abilities in each and every child.  In another bilingual class, the teacher has the groups in families, that is, one person is the father, another the mother, several siblings, etc.  They remain in this family all year and help each other both academically and personally.  What will be the long-term results?"

"I try to make my classroom the NO FEAR zone where students need not be afraid to make mistakes. I encourage my students to learn from their mistakes, but I still find a few who are scared that they'll be laughed at. I empathize with them since there've been times when I felt that way too."

"Generally, I am not surprised, but the specific data was still a bit shocking.  Math in schools is presented so much as facts and procedures that need to be learned for the next level of math the student will take. The requirements are way too much to really learn on any more than surface level and ends up just being more of a series of exercises in memorization...\when you see this, do this.\"" It can't be really surprising that most students don't remember all of those procedures as they enter each new course."""
"Students form their identity around the courses they take.  They have a math identity.  By tracking or putting them in groups by ability, we are preassigning that identity for them and for everyone else.  Student's assigned to certain \level\"" of classes(low, medium, high, honors,etc) now have this image of themselves as that descriptor.  Once student's are put in those classes and are tracked (which happens at an early age), parents, teachers and society buy in to said descriptor.  Oh Tommy, he is ok at math but not great because he is the middle class. Or Jenny is great at math she is in honors.  There is a lot of pressure and identity assigned along the continuum that supports a fixed mindset.  Jenny is less likely to take risks in math lest she loose her standing.  Upward or downward mobility is limited and those on the bottom will likely remain there through high school and those on top fear of losing this position.  Mathematical achievement of the individual begins to ossify with this identity or class level.  Students on the \""lower\"" end will achieve to the standard that has been assigned and no more.  While students at the \""higher\"" end will also be cautious in achievement because they have been held to a higher standard of \""smart\"" and do not want to loose it."""
"Sadly, many students receive the negative messages about math from their family members and from us \professionals.\"" I have often heard a parent say, \""They didn't get the math gene.\"" \""Their dad is the math person, not me.\"" Students see how their siblings have succeeded or struggled with math and draw the conclusion that they, too, will perform the same way. We also give these messages to students when we always call on the \""smartest\"" kid or the fastest kid to raise their hand. When we don't structure activities that give ample think time or value multiple ways to approach the problem, we send messages to students that they just aren't as bright or can't do the work. Our American culture does not place a high value on academic success. Being a \""nerd\"" because you like school/math/science is not considered a popular thing! It's not just the media, it's so much more."""
As an intervention I would want to do an exercise with a group of girls where they would list reasons of why a maths topic is relevant to them. Eg Why do YOU need to learn algebra? or why do YOU need to learn geometry? Where do they feel maths fits in with their lives? How do your values and personality fit in the world of mathematics?
I think that people experience a freedom to be creative when solving a problem when they see all of the different ways others reached their solution. It opens up their minds to grow their brains and hopefully use these strategies another time when they encounter other types of problems.
"I am going to relate to students that the smartphones they are using did not happen overnight. Mistakes were made and corrected along the way, rephrased with the phrase, \I had a bug in my problem but its fixed now.\"""""
"I began my teaching career very young in Vista Unified School District, placed with the high school kids who spoke no English. It was assumed that math was this universal language, and just because the course was taught in their language- they should achieve. The variables were never considered. I was the teacher who had \those kids,\"" the ELs. When my students started performing, the department chair made a comment about the benchmark exams -\""well your kids are doing better because their test is easier.\"" Which was a lie. i corrected her by explaining that they took the exact same test her students took, only in Spanish.  she was shocked. I encouraged my students to live the math. This was frowned upon. "
The peer review is fast becoming my favourite part of this course.
"When I was in college, at Univ. of Utah, Professors Jenks & Peck taught Math for teachers and they introduced this to their students. I was fortunate to be one of those students.  They used ten frames with dots in random order. after the initial number talk withthe dot cards, they suggested flashing through a variety of the cards for a class response which would get the studnts to see the numbers an learn to quickly notice the numbers from random dot order.  I noticed what my brain did withthe dots. "

"My literary mind may not make sense, but......I would try to convey to my students the sentiment that \The mind is expansive, pliable, plastic, magnificent.  Anything is possible.\""  Don't be afraid to imagine, abstract, and go on a math adventure.  Skip down the path of concrete concepts.  In doing so, don't see the potholes as stumbling blocks, but as puddles to splash in, potential departure points, bike jumps laying in wait, in the making. Anxious for little girls and boys with hokey pokeys and shovels.\"""""
"Thanks, that's a coherent answer."
"Hello,"
I completely agree with you.
"I've heard negative math messages from parents, media, students, other teachers, self-driected messages... and the list goes on. I think it often has to do with the way that math is graded. Students lose points for one thing after another (even if they have already been docked marks for the mistake at a previous point in their work) and are rarely congratulated or acknowledged for the amazing progress that they make in processes that they do understand. I have a student that scored incredibly low in another math class even though her understanding and thinking processes were incredibly advanced. It's extremely discouraging to be told that you're not good at something, especially when you are. Also there seems to be this notion floating around that if you get something wrong that you don't understand it. Getting something \wrong\"" is often a simple computation error that doesn't indicate whether or not the greater concept was understood. And getting something \""wrong\"" just means that there is room for more exploration, not that something will never be understood."""
These boys felt at ease discussing how they learn in mtath.  They have learning to use math vocabulary to accurately identify the strategies they use to solve problems.  Also they definitely have a growth mindset and have a contagious positive attitude towards learning math in later years.
"I often hear from parents at parent/teacher conferences \I was never any good at math so I can't help my kid with her homework,\"" which sends the message to students that if there parents weren't good at it and didn't need it, neither do they."""
"I was also shocked by the gender box and wonder why it isn't removed.  Or if it needs to be checked for data, put it at the end or somewhere not visible until the assessment is done."
Lot of interesting posts already. 
Also another argument is that lower level learners don't have to feel like the stupid ones (sorry for being so crass) and frustrated because they are not doing as well.  The irony is that tracking does the same thing.
The past four years I worked as a math specialist at a residential treatment program and enjoyed it. I changed schools this year to a small school and will have six preps.
At the beginning of the cohort I would show research on how the brain growth through making mistakes.  To reinforce to students that with plenty of practice and being persistent with questions they find hard they will succeed.
"I have heard several times from my students, especially the girls, \I just don't get it\"" hearing the desperation in their voices as if they never will. It's not that only certain genders or nationalities are good at math, EVERYONE can be good at math."""
"Time and time again, I hear parents, particularly moms, say in front of their children that they are not good at math. \Sally's dad is the one who helps her with math because I am not good at it.\"" I also believe that if the teacher doesn't bring some energy to math class, then the students will get a subtle message that math isn't important. \""So why should I try?\"""""
"I think we always need to teach in an open, ongoing differentiated way.  to have discussions as a class, then in small groups, working projects together with only formative assessments. Giving easy work is not the same as giving 'fun' work or giving a situation to the students that is challenging but that invites them to figure out together, to experiment.  To me THAT builds an internal sense of confidence."
"The math vocabulary that these boys use was outstanding. To hear a third grader repeated refer to decomposing numbers and friendly numbers and understand the meaning of this vocabulary was great. The way they describe their math as \free\"" was also exciting. A side conversation here is that they kept referring to their teacher as Nick instead of Mr. ______ brings me back to a conversation I had some years ago about familiarity versus respect. Does allowing students to call a teacher by his/her first name cause a lack of respect or does it allow the student to see the teacher as a partner in learning?"""
By making it an expectation to visualize - show your work in pictures/diagrams 
"I work 1:1 with LD students. While they are given the same work, I modify it so that either they have less to do but can accomplish finishing rather that the feeling of failing to complete it. Or I get the work early & paraphrase the work so their 'mind-set' is of a different aspect of looking at it."
"To move forward, I think ideas for specific content and levels could help"

"I teach 1st grade at a Title One elementary school. I often hear parents tell their kids, \It's okay. I was never any good at math either. Don't worry about it.\"" Sometimes adding, \""Just do your best.\"" But all of those messages tell the kids,\""It's okay to be bad at math. It's not your fault.\"""""
"In my opinion and experience with other teachers, the teaching methods play a huge roll which can be a problem (example: teachers using only worksheets or workbooks and showing one or two examples in a non student group setting), which leads to lack of foundational knowledge by students, which then in turn students do not show ability, therefore that is the reason why algebra is so difficult for many."
"My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, and I'm an 8th grade middle school math teacher at a public school in New York City. In grad school, we read some excerpts from Jo's work and I was captivated. I'm very excited to be participating in this class, and I hope to know more about what I can do to change the model in my class from an \ability-based\"" one to an \""effort-based\"" one."
I have a book all about inventions that were made from mistakes. I think I will share that book with my students and then talk with them about the importance of our learning from each other's  mistakes throughout the year.
"This is coming today, sorry about the delay, Jo"
"Math is like martial arts. We come, we play like little tigers. We try lots of stuff. We watch what happens. We watch what works and think about other things to try when stuff doesn't work so well. And the game is to play!"
"Hi Peter, I am excited to see new Common Core Math text books! Thanks for taking this class!"
"I agree on having questions about the \legal moves\"".  I took it mean that you had to use exactly four 4s.  I also took it to mean that exponents except to the fourth power would not be acceptable because that would introduce another digit.  I wasn't sure about square roots because I'm not sure the students would have that knowledge at that point and it also introduces another non-four digit.  However, I'm not sure how to solve some of them without using square roots."
"This past school year, I taught a Grade 9/10 split locally developed math course. It is the lowest level tracked math class.  As I worked with the students, I realized that while a few of them were there because they were low achieving, the majority of them were there because of outside issues.  The majority were in and out of school because of issues at home (children's aid society, sick parents, emancipated from their parents, etc.)  It wasn't that they were not capable of doing math, but that they ended up missing so much school time and there were huge gaps in their knowledge.  As I tried to fill in the gaps (I don't know how successful I was with everyone), achievement started to improve.  When I spoke with the head of Student Success, I voiced concerns that a few students were improperly placed.  That the class was beneath them once they were caught up on the concepts but they weren't promoted to the next level."
"GATE is another fixed mindset label. The intent behind GATE was helping kids who think differently avoid failing out of school. People like Einstein. GATE, today, is a tragedy of fixed mindset thinking. Homogeneous GATE, is beyond stupid. All it should take is the ACLU looking into the racial profile of these classes to see they are just race-based groupings. Why are there not more African-Americans in those classes? In my school, 90% of the class is of Asian decent. Really? Parents have fixed mindsets that they expect the schools to continue to honor and it is just wrong."

"Hi I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Washington, DC.  I'm a learning specialist and I tutor elementary students in math and reading.  I have two daughters and just returned from Edinburgh, Scotland where I did an MSc in Inclusive and Special Education.  I'm really interested in changing how students, parents and teachers view math education and math 'issues'.  I want my students to love their mathematical brains in whatever form they come in and to be much less intimidated by math.  Looking forward to discussing ideas with you all."
Student's gain different perspectives on how to arrive at the same answer.  There was an aha moment at one point of the clip with the square which I thought was neat.  There were so many different ways and patterns to discover.
All the natural tendancies.
I think it is very important to make sure that the students know that math is everywhere. Finding activities that students are already interested in and showing them where math in involved is great!
"A lot can be done with representations. Try to draw the multiplication of expressions, and see how that could be used 'backwards' to work towards the quadratic formula, for instance."
Here is a link to my Poster.
Also that effort is required to learn.
...Love this comment.
my eyes have just opened a little wider
"Parents: \Math is not your thing\"" or \""You are just like me - I never got math\"""
"Have the intervention teacher work in the classroom -- but don't pull kids out! Keep it mixed so that all the students can hear how other students approach solutions. Let them struggle, learn and embrace mistakes. My son was pulled into \intervention\"" in 3rd grade and 5 years later he still thinks he \""just can't do math.\"" But when he's given the opportunity to listen to varying approaches, he does \""get\"" it. Keep asking yourself, \""Does this make sense?\"""""
I try to give the students assignments at the first of the year to boost their confidence.  We try to work through those stereotypes and the year will be more successful.
I do agree with you. But I have witnessed some teachers who take the making of mistakes by students very negative and consider it unacceptable for them. Thats how some of the student finds maths difficult and start cornering from it.
"When you have something as simple as a card with dots on it, there are definitely going to be a number of ways that an observer can analyze it. Similar to how Joe explained it in the video, he noticed that each person solved the problem in a linear way. One observer might take the dot card as a simple visual representation of something - maybe of patterns, or of a symbol that keeps repeating itself. Using a dot card \talk\"" in a math class would give students a perfect experience in learning how to appreciate and respect other methods of how we look at something. For example, one student might look at a dot card as a math problem while another student might think of it as something more visual, or artistic, with the repeating of symbols, shapes or designs acting together to make one picture."""
They are probably going to input some good and bad feedback exaples for us to lern how to do it propoerly.
"Hello, I teach in a small rural school in Vermont.  I am teaching 6th grade math using the Connected Math Program next year and would like some ideas as to how to inspire my students to love math and to look at math with new eyes."
I believe number talks are great for others to see different ways to solve the same problem.  I learned a lot from watching the video and seeing how others solved the same thing I was looking at.  Watching other people helped to open my mind to the math equation; I feel I could learn more if I took part in a number talk.
I'm glad they stopped selling this shirt.  I think it's ironic that the person quoted for saying the shirt wasn't a big deal admitted that she wasn't good at math and probably wouldn't finish her degree because of it.
I agree that the dot cards can be used to visualize numbers as being composed of different combinations of numbers - one aspect of a sense of number.
"These kids seems to genuinely love math with Nick, and they love to contribute ideas and manipulate numbers.  They have confidence in their learning and aren't afraid to make mistakes.  They sense how much greater their math abilities and understanding have gotten with the math talks."
"I'm still amazed and freaked out by how many diverse methods people devise for accomplishing (seemingly) simple mathematical tasks. I think this task and discussion are valuable in that students can see and learn that there are many approaches to math, all valid. It also communicates a more \fluid\"" approach to math that seems to be lacking in our more 'traditional' teaching/learning activities."""
i love that no one makes fun of any one else in the class
"Makes people look for patterns, and it is a simple way to encourage discussion.  Can help us to start looking for different ways to look at numbers, patterns, and encourage creativity."
"I think you gain the insight that we all see groups of things differently. I think they are important because it brings out to students that there is no ONE method that is correct, but many ways of doing the same thing and they all lead to the same conclusion."
Big ideas: Take your time. Allow yourself to think intuitively.  Math needs to be understood. Become emotionally involved with math.
...Research has shown that your brain doesn't grown unless you make mistakes!
"I agree with these different values. It is not only about showing the students that there are different methods of solving, but also validating them as all equally valuable. I had not thought about the compression piece, but I think you are right that this could make information more clear. I have also had the experience where you  solve a problem one way, but then it makes more sense the way someone else solved it, so you internalize it more."
I will be interested in this too.
This happens a lot in my SMARTboard lessons!  Oops another typo!
Simple but true!
"We have a group of students at our middle school who take on extra math work outside of class.  For them, math is an extra curricular activity.  They do contests, attend math circles, and/or do work on various websites at home.  The parents of these students do not want to see tracking eliminated, for they fear that their students will not be challenged.  In some ways, I am not sure that our grouping is by \ability\"", but more by student \""interest\"" or \""motivation\"".  Does this result in the same fixed mindset messages?  Some kids work very hard at soccer and make it onto \""competition\"" teams, but for some reason we never say to the kids on the recreation teams that they can't work extra hard and make it to a \""comp\"" team as well.  Kids KNOW that soccer is all about hard work and practice, so why can't a school provide an extra challenging math program for kids who take on extra work and practice?  As long as everyone knows that enrollment in that class is open to all who demonstrate the interest and motivation, shouldn't it be okay?  I am worried for the very small percentage of kids who thrive on a math challenge if we completely eliminate tracking. (I had students who would skip a birthday party rather than miss an after school math contest class.  It was that important to them.)  I think it is all about the messaging, and then making sure that the various levels are open to all who are interested in doing what it takes to be successful."""
My 6th grade teacher had our math class grouped from highest to lowest and I always wanted to know how are they getting it and I am not.
"I agree that most of the class seemed done.  During first class we saw of Cathy's (not the one with the Stanford students), the same thing happened.  She was trying to engage them and most of the class was sort of \zoning out.\"".  In my opinion she talks too long about a subject.  She would do better to change viewpoints.  As I said in another post, she could have asked, if there are 44 colored squares on the border, how large is the big square.  It is the same concept but a new slant which might have caught the students' attention."""
Mistakes are the building blocks of brain growth!
Shows different strategies for solving the same problem.
Letting the students come up with their theories and treating them as such. And assuming the relevance of a theory until it is thoroughly proven wrong and the proof acknowledged and understood by the whole class. 
This is how I saw it at first-  n squared + 2n + 1.
"My favorite statement on these 5 pages was \By concentrating on what, and leaving out why, mathematics is reduced to an empty shell.\""  So true!  Unfortunately we don't include enough why in our classrooms due to time constraints and testing standards."""
"I think my message for students will be focused on the value of making mistakes. I think I will start by having my students reflect on how they feel when they make a mistake, then use that as a springboard to begin discussing whether anyone feels accomplished or successful when they make a mistake. It's counter-intuitive to feel successful when one has made a mistake, but really, mistakes are often what leads to success and growth. Then I would like to emphasize the message that mistakes are known to lead to brain growth, and therefore help us develop as thinkers and learners. I will even share with my students my experience in this course, and how much I learned about mistakes and their value. Perhaps even share with them some mistakes I may have made throughout this course!"
"Hello everyone, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from California.  I teach sixth grade math and am looking forward to finding ways to improve the math experience for all students.  I'll see you out there in the discussions."
"I loved this question! So many fun opportunities for figuring out what happened.  The longer I thought about it myself, the more the race came alive."
"I would give two examples for the kids to work out - one thats easy to get right and one thats more challenging and where kids might make some mistakes in their first attempts and then ask them which one they learned more from and which one exercised their brains more - and then tell them about the brain research evidence that making mistakes in maths is what grows our brain, not getting the right answer all the time"
Based on Jo's Announcement - not until after Sept. 27 - at least how I interpret it.
"I didn't get that statement at first : )  I was thinking \What does that mean?  He doesn't have to pay anything to learn math??\"""
"How much of this course has been about contextualising maths, visualising maths, applying maths in the real world?  With this in mind, who's deli counter cuts their turkey slices in exactly equal weights? I would expect and encourage my students to think about this problem and in doing so visualise three slices of turkey. We cannot 'expect' them to assume all three to be exactly the same weight, to do so is to introduce some of the very issues this course is trying to resolve. If the answer is two and a quarter slices we have to tell the students to assume equal weight slices or, better still, ask them to describe what assumptions they have made in reaching this answer. The correct answer to this problem is that the man can eat three quarters of what he has bought. My next question to students would be \How do you think the man can make sure he is eating the correct amount of turkey for his diet?\""."""
"The first year I taught 6th grade, I couldn't understand how students could make it to 6th grade knowing as little as they did. When I taught fifth grade, I began to understand. I was required to teach a new topic of Math everyday, regardless of whether many students mastered the information. One day, a post test showed that exactly 3 students mastered the concept. I asked my principal for permission to spend another day on the concept and he said \no\"". I vowed that the minute CSTs were over, I would teach \""my way\"", so we began the program \""Rocket Math\"" to teach kids automaticity in multiplication. They loved it."""
I think to make students willing to share ideas and feel anxious about what others will think if they mistakes students need to know all the positive things that result from mistakes.  An activity might be to have students write on post-it notes positive things and negative things about mistakes and put them on two posters.  I would review all the positive things and tie in a discussion about brain growth.  I would destroy the negative poster and tell students I don't even want to bother reading any of them because they are not important.
"I definitely agree that the teacher's attitude towards math matters a lot, and gets conveyed to the students!"
"If I'm not good in math, I will not get good jobs and therefor, not succeed in my professionnal life in general."
I also loved that they felt confident going into fourth grade!
"Opportunity for improvement before the next version of this course -- I think more explanation is required for why the visual had 4 and 6 boxes for the 2:3 ratio.  Why not simply 2 and 3?  (If attempting to avoid fractions with the second ratio, explicitly state this.)  It seems to be by chance and this is not at all the case."
"same moan - completed items are not updated as they should be.  Now new problem - I read my feedback and agreed with then and even commented on them.  But it kept on getting me to resubmit and also telling me that I had responded - meanwhile \progress\"" remains stuck.  "
"The students had been liberated, they were now free to make the numbers work for them. Decomposing and adding, and sharing perspectives meant they had they had new strategies and confidence in their maths - the rules were gone, the hunt for friendly numbers was on."
"Message from parents, siblings, friends and every media"
May be just a different approach. Engage them.
My school has started to move along the line of the growth mindset. We encourage student effort and they get a chance to investigate a problem/idea of their choice and present their findings at a school-wide math fair. This is our second year.
We'll be utilizing Kagan strategies in Geometry this year! I'm very excited about it!  I'm a big fan of flexible grouping and hands-on learning.
"Openness - By phrasing the question \how do you see the shapes growing\"" as your first question, it opened the discussion up to all students. Avoiding this question in version 2 lacks that openness and buy in for the students. Not everyone could answer the final question right away and may give up quickly, but your initial question gets the buy in for the follow up question."
"I agree with all of the comments I've read in this response.  My adult students come with so much baggage about their math ability; it is truly haunting!  I have had students in their 40s and 50s who can quote their teachers' and parents' comments about being stupid or about not doing things the \right way.\""  I can only assume that some of those teachers had such a tenuous understanding themselves that they could not handle when students thought about things in a different way."""
"The dot cards allow students to see groups of numbers in a variety of ways without fear of looking \dumb\"" in front of their classmates. Dots are familiar because many of us play games with dice and recognize groups of numbers up to 6. Students are also able to recognize that there is more than one way to solve a problem where all answers are the same."""
I'm an 8th grade math and science teacher at an international school in India.  I'm originally from California where I taught for 15 years. I want to engage all my students in math while learning how to be a better problem solver myself.
"I have a student that was bumped forward by a previous teacher, so he was working two grade levels ahead of his class. We discussed pushing him forward but he does not have the critical thinking or problem solving skills of a student two years his senior.  He is able to see and repeat a process, often I wonder if he fully understands the \why\"". He is unable to problem solve or determine what needs to be done in an unfamilair situation. I think that pushing this student forward has harmed his growth, he has been shown that memorizing and mimicry are ways to be successful in math, and when faced with a novel situation he does not know what to do and does not have the resources to cope with the situation."""
"It was surprising to hear how much they enjoyed the actual work involved in solving an equation.  Solving math problems the math talk way is more work but the kids seem to enjoy it a lot more, is it because the do it with partners instead of alone?  is it because they discuss the answers as a community instead of getting a C for correct next to their answer? Is it the power of taking numbers and manipulating them as much as they need to get the answer"
"Or teachers who have the math skills, but don't know how to make them comprehensible to students."
It was very interesting to see that some people had drastically different ways of seeing from my own way.
Hi!  I am a 2nd grade teacher in Weber School District in Northern Utah.  Where is Cupertino Union School district located?  I hope we can share some ideas!
"I just saw a wonderful movie, Free the Mind. In it, one of the scientists, working in a small classroom, starting to explain their thinking capacity by showing them a plastic model of the brain. I am reminded of that now, and will go out to find a model of the brain to show students, and then explain what happens inside the brain when they make mistakes, focusing on the growth model. I will keep that model in the classroom, and use it to remind all of us that the work of school is about exercising the brain, and using it to construct understanding, not find answers. I will try to find a brain model that has the most detail so students understand what a  treasure it is, and how special it is."
It appears that every time I go back to session one my multiple choice answer is missing and I am asked to resubmit my answer.  Is anyone else experiencing this same technical difficulties.
"Well, you're right, it's hard to get over the cuteness.  I was surprised that they thought the same things I did and had that much sophistication.  You get to see how you think and then how others think,\ I really liked!  Good in math and good in communication.  Why all boys, though?  Hummm...."""
"The variety of strategies used to think about the configuration of dots helps students see that there are different ways to visualize, and therefore think about numbers."
This year I want to focus on helping each child to know that he is capable of learning math.  Anything that he does not understand is learnable and will be learn if he continues to work at it.  He just doesn't understand it YET.
ditto
"Yea, it's funny that screaming through an ever-lengthening list of procedures again and again seems to be the \intervention\"" of choice. Finding the \""challenging\"" that is not overwhelming can be a ... challenge, though :)"""
"One of the thing I would like to really share with the students, is that there is a difference between asking if you are good at math and whether or not you have had the exposure to math that you need in order to solve a problem."
Students who ask those deeper questions... What happens if this is changed? Does this apply in such-and-such a situation? Will be lauded and deep discussions will occur without me providing the answer. I will get especially excited if the ask a question that I do not know the answer to - and will tell them that I am learning along with them and from them!
Here's my concept of Maths. Please let me know what you think.
"Mistakes are so important in YOUR development,GRADES will partially be based on the number of mistakes made toward success. "
"Typically we decompose numbers but this activity helps us see how to compose numbers and group them together in vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lines and by bonding numbers together."
"Thanks, <redacted>.  Yes, I figured finding x by solving the quadratic was the object since that is what we do in Algebra 1.  So, when you see ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and you don't find values for a or b, then you start to wonder.  Someone above suggested that a and b are what you get when you solve the quadratic, but we know that is not the case.  Perhaps he/she misunderstood my question. Thanks, again, for directing me to the information.  One of the problems with using lesson plans like these is wading through it when you are pressed for time."
The students surprised me with how confident the math talks made them feel about using the numbers in different ways to get the answer. They were also not worried about making a mistake which was great! They felt that math was not a confined subject but instead allowed them to think freely and explore.
ccorrect!
"As a high school teacher I see 9th graders through Calculus students who STILL don't understand division of fractions (among other things...). Perhaps a shorter version of the lesson could have been as effective but overall I believe the extended time spent deeply thinking about ideas we know students struggle to understand and retain is probably worth it in the long run. I struggle to remember and believe this when planning my own lessons and trying to \get through\"" all the concepts assigned to each course."""
Number talks are a neat way to see that there are different ways to approach a problem. I think that they can be helpful for getting at conceptual rather than procedural or algorithmic approaches to problems.
"If students are going to be broken up into groups, shouldn't it be based on interest, passion and dedication rather than the year of their birth or a teacher's expectations of them?"
"While certainly teaching methods are not reaching every child what seems to be reinforcing the lack of student progress seems to be keeping students from the knowledge. We tend to think that if a student doesn't master foundational skills then they cannot be asked to take on higher thinking problem solving. Could we be going about this all backwards? While having foundational skills will make a student's life easier, maybe we need to give them a reason for those very skills? If we put forward a challenging appropriate problem to solve, without a script, will all learners take on the task? If we don't limit what we believe they can learn, will they find the best solution? And along the way find that foundational skills are helpful? "
"From what I've seen, regardless of the teaching method the instructors learned in school, the requirements are high scores on standardized tests. This implicitly enforces a policy of teaching answers but not necessarily the fundamentals in how to work to those answers."
People assume there is only one way to think in math.  Math Talks show there are many different ways to think mathematically.
"So the question is, what skills do students need to help them understand the big ideas?  Also, do students always use their skills to advance their understanding.  There's a difference between knowing the bits and using the bits."
I think it is very important for students to see tat there are many different ways to solve a problem.  I liked how the teacher asked for similarities in approaches.
"In response to Keith Devlin's quote about math being more than the notation, etc."
"For maths, we don't group students by ability until the exam years where they go into flexible wide bands although other subjects do."
The students considered math as fluid and not some rigid procedures and routine methods.
I find that word problems have evolved to using complicated names that distract from the equation. ie...Tramecia had 6 apples and Jawanza had 4....  I recommend that the student use a simpler name in place or their own friends names. ie..Tammy and Jay in order to focus on the equation and not name pronunciation.
"The 'big' media is often blamed for sending out negative messages, but if they did not contain an element of reality, they would be isolated and rejected.The primary exposure to this message is through their local community, the environment they were brought up in. This includes most of the adults that they come into contact with. Parents, neighbours, relatives will all have a socialising part to play in developing a mindset that it is \ok not to do well in maths\"". Even those that have been successful on maths courses will, as Paul Lockhart indicated in Mathematicians Lament, reach a point where they have to be creative with their mathematics and realise that a major part of their learning and achievement has been following predetermined rules and as such have not been 'doing real maths'. 'Can't do maths' is also confused with 'struggling with maths', a get out clause for students with little self sufficiency and resilience."""
I think that many students might change their method after viewing others ideas.  Then in the future they have several ideas about how to think about a different problem.
"Hi Shannon, have you ever heard of Ball-a-vis-x? Originated somewhat in your neck of the woods."
"Meaning and explaining the students that It is not how much you can that is important, but how much you learn that is important."
"I'd like to start the year off by surveying the kids about who they think can learn math and their thoughts on math intelligence.  This way, I can try to identify mindsets and focus on adapting them to all students feel capable of success in my room."
You can build this case with Lego blocks also so there would be something to feel as well as see.
I loved the explanation of WHY 6 was too big to be sensible.  Especially because students who have been taught a lot of rules without making sense of them WOULD be likely to multiply 2 and 3 and end up with 6 somewhere along the line.
"I work with special ed students in small groups so it is a little different but I do make sure that I am consistent with my 'user friendly' terminology, use of manipulatives and practical examples."
<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> 1
"Yes, that was my answer too. I ended up multiplying 15/8 by 60 minutes, to convert to minutes, and then to hours."
"None of it really surprised me.  When executed well, number talks provide students opportunities to come about problems from multiple entry points.  Mistakes are also welcome because students learn from mistakes, as they said in the video.  Also, students feel confident and are empowered do give their responses and answers because they are encouraged to take risks and are praised for giving their effort."
Okay...  I thought of exponents immediately because it is showing remarkable growth - exponential growth...
"This kind of talk helps us see the variety of ways that individuals see math.  No one was wrong.  No one had \the best\"" way.  Everyone was surprised and enlightened by hearing the thinking of the others in the class.  Everyone could see that their way was okay, but that others had \""okay\"" ways that were different.  It opens your mind to possibilities and helps you see in ways that were not available to you before."""
"None of the research surprises me that grouping isn't the best thing for our students.  Once in a group, it's hard to change: lower groups feel they cannot rise, and higher groups feel ashamed to fall. While we do have honors level classes at the high school where I teach, tracking doesn't seem to be too prevalent, although teachers will still pigeonhole students into a group based on previous test scores and teacher reports."
The message that math is for boys and girls only need to learn the basics keeps girls out of some of the careers that could use the input of women. I was raised not to excel in math and as I grow older I found out how much fun I had missed.
"Students might say--a time to share our thinking, fun, working together to problem solve. They were really thinking about the problems presented."
"Honestly, I find myself just clicking through them.  I've never come across one where the correct answer is 0."
"So many of my college-age students want to be elementary teachers, but they lack foundational knowledge.  It is likely that, as younger students, they were taught by teachers that also lacked foundational knowledge.  This foundational deficiency translates to a lack of ability, and it certainly causes the students to struggle with algebra."
A + 3 can represent many things.  It could represent the difference in two peoples_ ages.  It could be the temperature difference from one day to the next.
"What surprised me in Nick's class was first of all how happy the boys were to talk about their experience with math and the Number talks. They understood the decomposing of numbers and the importance and helpfulness to make friendly numbers. It was cool how the one boy expressed it by saying \it's FREE\"" you can do what you want. Also, what I thought was really COOL was how they felt that Nick teaching them Number talks was going to make them successful in the 4th grade e.g. if Nick didn't teach us this, we'd be really bad in the 4th grade."""
"What people can gain from a dot number card talk is again the notion that there are many different ways to see a number.  It starts with the visual and the teacher takes it to number sentences.  Kathy also made sure that the students recognized similarities between methods of clumping.  This is important because it reinforces the idea that any number has multiple representations---both visually and symbolically (number sentence).    To me, this is the groundwork for breaking up a number to use in the distributive property."
"So many times I find kids in my classroom working independently and not asking questions because they feel like asking questions makes them appear stupid.  I know I've said something similar to this statement in the past, but I want it to be clear to all students that making mistakes is expected in my classroom."
Yes!
The same thing is happening to me. I'm very discouraged.
"We use \mad minutes\"" to help kids gain fluency in basic computation.  We use 8 minute timed AIMS-web assessments as well. For the many children who are anxious about math, I believe that we are neither gaining fluency, or getting an accurate assessment."""
I did 10 x 10 = 100  7 x 10 = 70 and 2 x 5 = 10 then add 100 + 70 + 10 = 180.
I think that these are important because they have multiple entry points for students and all students can have a voice.  It also exposes students to the fact that numbers can be decomposed in different ways.
"Model, model, model!  Have them share out using educreations app where they talk through the problem as they represent it.  As you model and their peers model more, and talk about your/their thinking, students will identify those steps like Jo talked about."
I also would have liked to hear the ideas from the boy that said it didn't work.
In a dot card number talk students are provided a means to examine and explain their reasoning. The visual models form a common language.
"I wondered what doesn't help also. I liked that they weren't worried about making mistakes in the math talks, that others would help,them understand."
"The math part of the ACT (American College Tests) is a better test in my mind, because it is written by people that teach subjects that **use** math, not mathematicians."
Messages can be sent to our students direct or indirectly and both are damaging.
"In this video, we see how Cathy Humphreys truly embraces the sense maker norms.  She encouraged students to make different representations in their explanations.  She gave her students the gift of time to sort out collaboratively their thoughts.  The students were engaging in whole discussion, able to respectfully listen and question each other. Her way of valuing mistakes was masterful - it seems to often mistakes are either shut down, or in the guise of valuing mistakes, mistakes are encouraged, so the teacher can show where the error is... But this did not happen in the video.  The process was valued.  It seems more of convincing a student to discover the error them selves - to have them experience the \ah-ha\"" of what they were doing and how it relates to the work."
I did the same thing too and posted the answer <zipRedac>0000. Then I saw Krissy's post and knew I had gone wrong.Thanks for sharing this. I agree that students should check their answers to avoid being frustrated at themselves and Math.
"Difficult to think of with the bread slides The first thing that comes to my mind it's your on diet, don't eat bread. But, the next one is cut to the half the second slide and I would think it is ok because he can eat half wich is 1,5 and he's eating 2/3, 1,75. I am never sure of my calculations answers."
"I hope that I have not come across, too, harshly!"
"All students concluded there were 10 items in the dot card, but the discussion provided an opportunity to see how differently they each arrived at that number.  By doing so, it clearly revealed that there a numerous ways to solve a problem, providing them with a deeper thought and understanding."
"I can't remember anyone saying that African-American students aren't good at math, as much as it was understood. We weren't encourage to excel in math, and I can even remember teachers telling me, \don't worry, I'm not good at math either, and I am the teacher\"""""
"Thanks, I was wondering about that too."
You're missing 15 and 17?
I wrote down a variety of ways that Cathy uses questioning to engage all students in deeper thought:
I think these are important because they pull people outside of their routine of going to arithmetic facts they memorized. It can open their eyes to different ways to manipulate numbers.
"I am a mathematics education professor, hoping to positively impact the teaching of mathematics as I work with future and practicing mathematics teachers. This data is not surprising to me, nor are the anecdotes as I have heard many of the same stories. In fact, for some people it is their scarring experiences with mathematics that draws them to teaching to make a difference or bans them from teaching any grade level above second."
Here is a TED Talk by Dan Myers. He was the first person that gave me ideas on how to rewrite mathematics problems. I hope you enjoy! Adds to Session 4.2. :) 
I vote for faux pas
"I am a tutor for high school kids, and I would like to find a way to teach them math because most of them did not have a good foundation to start. I look forward to everyone's contribution."
"I'm just finishing a summer masters class on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Universal Design for Transition UDT).  This can provide tools/teaching/various methods of assessment that can be helpful for all learners so there is less need for differentiation.  CAST learning (www.cast.org) has some good videos/learning tools for teachers including brain learning and a class planning sheet that helps the teacher define needs for all the students in their class.  There is a UDL Worksheet for teachers with links to ways to improve your unit plan with multiple means of representation, multiple ways to express understanding, and multiple means for engagement.  That worksheet is at this web address:"
"Parents give negative messages when mom says, \Go ask dad for help with your Math.  Men are better with kind of work.\""  Or when Teachers just drill & practice the entire period, they make kids hate math.  Friends also scare friends when they talk about how hard math is or that they got a bad grade in it."""
"Curiosity is what keeps 3 year olds on the move from morning until night, 4 year olds with a one word vocabulary, \Why?\"" and 5 year olds so excited to go to school."""
"The thing that stands out in my mind is that people can see the creativity in math. Students get computational practice, but are engaged in the mathematical practices at the same time."
"By the time I get to work with students (5th grade level), they have had plenty of time to know what they seem to be good at or not good at.  They already seem to have their \negative talk\"" down.  They also have heard negative things many times over from their teachers and parents.  It takes time to \""undo\"" the negative talk that has come into their minds over the years."""
"I was surprised at some of the vocabulary used (e.g., decompose) but then if the teacher engages students in talking (through number talks and other discourse) in the classroom, then surely students pick up on that language and way of communicating the ideas."
"Thanks I totally agree, I was disappointed too. Maybe at the end of the lesson she could do an 'Exit Pass' task:"
We all know there is something wrong about math teaching.but no one had spoken up. Thank you for grabbing up this very urgent issue and let people thinking it seriously.
I propose in the first hour of my students to discuss a math mottoes:
this activity keeps the number out of it.That helps the student create the numbers they like they can then learn that some numbers are easier to add than others and will learn to group those when mentally adding and multiplying later.
I just searched the Discussions for ABE and found your post. I would be interested to know how you go about choosing or constructing your Brain Builders. Did you get any new ideas from this course on using visuals and puzzles to get adult students to expand the way they think about math?
"Students are bombarded from every direction! They hear it from their parents, from their peers, from all media and social media sources, and probably from their own schools and teachers and administrators (especially if those school folks are old timey-types). It would probably be easier to consider where they hear positive messages because those are so few and far between, in general."
"The common core is meant to incorporate aspects of each area of the curriculum into other areas of the curriculum. When I first started hearing about the Common Core, a few years ago, I was so confused by it. I didn't like what I was seeing or hearing. But as I learned more and started writing curriculum, I realized that it is directed toward my view of the way kids should be taught. The inquisitive, investigative, deep thinking, exciting, and fun, aspects of learning were lost somewhere along the way. I think it is more beneficial for students to learn through inquiry and investigation, than to have everything told to them and expect them to 'learn' and remember it. The Common Core actually requires less time to teach the total curriculum because you can make connections with each area of the curriculum."
"As a teacher, I couldn't teach math confidently today had I not overcome my mental block in math in high school. I don't think I was exposed to math stereotyping. No matter, one way for  a \victim\"" of stereotyping to overcome and move on would be to experience \""good\"" math--workshops are a good place to start. These are usually conducted by enthusiastic experts who help inspire the learner. The teaching of conceptual math needs to start early for a student's math development. Drills and memorizing facts are meaningless if their use is not understood as a tool, rather than   the end result."""
"I have use similar language with the young students in my classroom when we are studying science.  \Use your science brain as we take this walk.  Look for changes in leaves/flowers/ etc as we walk.  Think about answering questions with the things you observe.\""  "
I was probably the oddity as a student.  I had no interest in real life problems and actually found them boring. (I still do but I try to bring them to class.)  I thought it was just cool how everything fit together.  It was like doing a puzzle.
"Runner C takes an early lead!  Runner C hits a hurdle and loses his stride and is passed by rest.  Runner A now emerges as the leader!  He is increasing his lead!  Can he keep up that pace?  He is loosing speed, and Runner B is catching him.  Is it too late?  It's down to the wire, and Runner B takes the lead just before they cross the finish line!"
"I found it interesting that they kept referring to math as free and really seemed to understand the idea of decomposing numbers. They also acknowledged how different this class was to those they were part of years before.  Their sense of freedom and the flexibility in how to solve problems seems to have helped their confidence, as well."
"I feel that because there are so many different methods and styles for teaching math, these often contribute to the lack of foundational knowledge for a large amount of students. It is very easy for students to become confused and frustrated when they are only shown one way of doing math.  By utilizing more than one way to solve and practice simpler problems at the onset, teachers may find their students responding more when given a greater choice."
"The most negative message a student gets about maths is when she actually does it, when she talks to other student or to siblings. It is a message conveyed through the medium of unmitigated boredom."
I strongly encourage everyone to watch this musical number about how from the ashes of failure spring the roses of success.  I believe this sums up in a most enjoyable way the major point being made in this lesson!
It is about time that we look at the effort the students put forth rather than just the final project.  They both are important components to teaching and learning!!
"In preparing to teach this class, I spent time working on an online course about how to learn math. What I learned was that the new evidence about brain growth shows that it is better to make mistakes than just get fast, correct answers to problems you already know. So, we are going to celebrate mistakes and learn from them. Your brains will grow and so will mine. Think of assignments and tests as opportunities to make mistakes and not as opportunities for grades. Rather, your grades will be based on effort and growth."
"I think this depends on the purpose of the lesson.  If the teacher is trying to teach a particular method of solution then insisting on the student using that method and showing that was how they solved the problem is part of the lesson.  In real life who cares how you solve it, but in math class, especially algebra, it's about learning how to use those tools.  this is part of why I like my students to show their work, I want to know what their method of solution was.  You can do something wrong and still get the right answer, doesn't make it right."
They have to free write - no prompt - about math daily.
"most of those come from friends, relatives and peers. "
embarrassed
"I have answered all questions in sessions 1 and 2, but I have several 0/1 in each!  How can this be changed?  Is there something I have done wrong or need to do differently?"
"I also prefer when students get to get up and explain their thinking and show both the visualization and the number statement.  This encourages everyone to be involved and voice their opinions because it appears to be \easy\"".  Everyone can feel successful and it shows that math is creative and there are multiple ways to reach an answer."""
"The power of words, whether written or spoken, whether positive or negative have a huge impact on a child. We, as teachers, need to be constantly aware of our words as well as our actions."
Me too.  Nice to meet you.
"I think the teacher's role is very important throughout the whole process of learning maths. Moreover, teacher's methods and approaches make a huge difference in learning maths. Teacher's methods change students' perceptions that learning or doing math is difficult. It also determine and change students attitude that math is hard and high math can be done just by some people."
It has been scientifically proven that each and every one of you can and will be successful in math.
"The number talks let students see the many different ways there are to approach a problem.  There is not just one \right\"" way to do it.  By seeing different approaches, there may be an approach that works well for a student that he/she had not thought of before."""
"For me this is really a stretch!  I easily solved one way, but am challenged by finding two additional ways:"
and vice versa.
A combination of Teaching Methods and the discouragement many get when they take a High School Algebra course.
"Different methods to get to the solution, but only one solution!"
"I think that students often get negative messages about math from their parents, and sometimes their teachers."
"Great but how do you get them to only talk about the problem? I have a class of 7 sped students and it's hard for them to work in small groups without getting side-tracked. Even \whole group\"" is a challenge!"""
"I went looking for this story because I thought it might be something cool and inspirational to share with my kids. What's amazing is that when I searched, I found that several children have undergone this procedure and recovered, so this story is not an isolated incident!"
I think it is more pervasive than just at home. Check out this list of Science misconceptions on reddit. The top comment is a mathematician complaining about being considered a human calculator. 
"Dream not to commit mistakes, but if you do promise yourself to learn from it."
"I hadn't thought of using \two truths and a lie\"" for this-- what a great idea!"""
"check the \peer grading\"" thread. evidently the techs are working on it"""
"Some may think in terms of money.  There are 4 quarters(25 cents each) in one dollar, 8 quarters (25 cents each) in $2.  If the student takes 25 cents from each dollar, it's 50 cents.  So, 25% of 200 is 50."
"I am in a teaching credential program and definitely see people struggling to pass the basic Math exams. The CBEST, and CSET. Many of them have left the program or take longer than others."
"I teach 6th grade math at a small independent school, and the classes are mixed ability levels for the most part. The classes are great and we all feel pretty good about not tracking. Our students also take a second math class during one trimester. This year for the first time, we are ability grouping in the trimester class so that we can offer extra support for our lowest ability students. These students have been struggling for years. Are we tracking?"
Understanding how the brain functions and grows is incredible. This understanding shows that all students can learn and seeing students develop and learning is the wonderful part of being a parent and teacher.
that is a good question! How do students attain this flexibility to decompose?
I'm with Ginny and Christine. There is no substitute for a good teacher teaching a good lesson. I just learned about Dan Meyer's three act lessons and it's the best I've seen. The first act is a hook to catch the student's interest and get buy-in. It looks like a great way to teach.
Was it that they worked in groups that helped them enjoy the learning process?  Working and thinking together is so much better for many students than struggling alone or depending on a parent at home to re-teach what wasn't clear or didn't stick.
When I put the data in a table I notice that each time to the case number increases by 1 the number of blocks increase by 3.   
"using the dot cards in a number talk scenario allows class members to first 'think' about solving he set task then explaining verbally their 'workings' thus allowing fellow students an insight on how their brain works..there are/could be several ways to solve a task, students can come up with different methods to solv a given task."
"Hi there,"
"Speed does not make you a math person or a smart person. Maybe understanding speed is part of math. But I'm talking about speed of thought. I've known great mathematicians that are fast calculators, but that is not why they are great mathematicians. On that note, I've seen very intelligent people that are very \slow,\"" you might even think slow-witted or \""ditzy\"" (though I hate that term). But then you read something that they wrote, and took a long time to write and consider, and it's just brilliant."""
"come from comics in newspaper, elementary teachers who had their own trouble with math, administrators in schools, and, of course, parents and siblings."
"Students are sometimes told that they just aren't mature enough to \get it\"" and they will \""get it\"" as they mature."""
Half my answer disappeared. To continue:
"In my school we group students but it is done in a different way than simply grouping the high students together. In 8th grade students are able to take Integrated Algebra instead of 8th grade math if they are \strong math students\"" and they are in a class with all 8th graders.  However when they hit Geometry they can now be an advanced 9th grader in a class with on track 10th graders or students repeating the class as 11th graders who failed.  The ability ranges in one given class can be extreme and at times very difficult to reach everyone."""
"Many students view their education as a series of tasks to be completed, rather than a means of preparation for the tasks of adulthood; they quantify the point of termination rather than grasping the concept of lifelong learning. Thus, this mindset lowers the priority given education. They see lessons and courses as things to be completed; skills learned are not put fully to use because there is minimal pressure to do so. An analogy is learning to drive: You study a book of rules and regulations to pass a test for a learners permit, which is used to actually practice operating the vehicle. You then demonstrate highway and parking skills and are awarded a license. At that point, a marginal (knowledgable, yet unexperienced and potentially dangerous) driver joins all others. It is continued practice, full of trial and errors, that makes this person a more competent driver ... until old age begins reversing the process. The incentives for improvement driving skills are the likelihood of killing oneself or others, loss of driving privileges due accidents, and expense of vehicle repairs and medical costs. Math, like driving, is a series of skills that must be used (applied) in order to be retained, used successfully and improved."
"agreed! It's just as unfair for the \top\"" to be consistently bored as it is for the \""bottom\"" to be consistently lost and confused. I think ability grouping helps narrow the gap the teacher needs to teach to, enabling everyone to succeed."""
These three children clearly loved their math lessons... and their teacher!  I was impressed that they had the confidence to use the terminology to describe what they were doing.
"We have been taught and conditioned that it is more important to get the problem right than understand the why or how.  When we get a problem right that is the end of it.  We don't think about it any more. We no longer worry about they why or the how. There is no more growth for the brain.  But, when we make a mistake we get to go back and ask questions.  We get to explore and wonder and ponder.  This year in school I hope we make mistakes.  We are going to celebrate mistakes.  This way we are really going to understand and contemplate and really allow our brain to grow."
One of the things I wonder about is whether the analogy of the musician/painter is really apt as a comparison. 
High expectations are always the way to go.  If it helps any please remember formative assessment will really help you to see what they are missing conceptually so that you can fill in those ideas/skills that they need to solve the larger picture questions.  I have found that so many times if we can just fill in that missing piece so many things come into place.
"I too teach geometry students in a class that has some, but not all, students with IEPs.  I don't time the tests for anyone, and it generally works out.  How I do it is to limit how many questions are on the test (I shoot for two sheets of paper, front and back, maximum), and students do get the whole test at once (unless that is an accommodation for them).  The majority of kids finish in my expected time limit (1 hour).  The few who don't have to finish in study hall, but they are a minority (10-20% of the class).  I find that many of my students have a mental time limit to what they're willing to spend on a test, and will stop themselves.  Certain students I have had to stop and say that they can finish in study hall, but that's when there's only one kid working and he's gone for 10 minutes more than everyone else kind of thing.  We do have 90 minute blocks for my school, so that may be a help in the time setting."
"By thinking of the slices in terms of twelfths (since 12 is a common denominator for 3 & 4), 1/3 = 4/12 and 1/4 = 3/12, he could have 2 1/4 slices."
"What I'd like to know is whether those who promote ability grouping and tracking also have a mistake-friendly culture?  My fear with tracking or ability grouping is the pressure of performance learning, delivering the correct answer versus learning, growing, making a mistake and learning from correcting it.  Because if you're tracked and make a mistake, isn't there the fear that you'll drop a level or group?  And then self-esteem, etc. spirals down from there?  Is the pressure (self-imposed and received as expectations messages from teachers/parents) with tracking and high ability groups worth it, especially if they're promoting a fixed mindset approach?"
"The course is not tracking.  Please make sure we are able to enter our responses because we can't now.  Progress is not tracking on sessions 5 on.  If the course was prematurely turned off,can you put it back on?  If not, please extend this course so those of us who are still working (in the allotted time) will get the credit.  Thanks."
"Jo made a comment in video 2.2 \All students, maybe except, you know, those with a very specific LD, but all other students can achieve at the highest levels in math, in all levels of school through high school.\""  This statement needs clarification in terms of math teaching, but it could also be another course in itself to do justice to LD needs.  Also, what about people who performed terribly during their school years, but then develop a great ability later?  I heard of someone who became a math specialist as a career, having experienced \""aha\"" epiphanies during her college years, though the primary school years were a disaster and great frustration."""
"I believe it begins with the parent or guardian at home.  Their own personal opinion affects how the student will feel.  If mom or dad say they hate math and did not do well, the student in turn will feel the same about their own success with math."
"In addition to media, teacher's subtle to downright forward messages,peers have a contagious effect on keeping this negativity about maths alive."
"The opening of the mind comes from the exchange of understanding and vision of the world around us. Similarly, mathematics do not follow a single rule of vision or understanding, it is a malleable discipline."
"There are simple parts of the problem, and more difficult parts, so those that at least get started, have a better chance to persevere. There are ways that each member of the group can contribute. Using algebra to model situations."

What we can see from the number talk is there are many ways to approach and do the exact same problem. 
"Hello, my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I will be a fourth-year high school physics teacher at high school in deep South Texas (La Feria). As math is the language of science - esp. physics - it's crucial for my classes. Yet I spend the first 2-3 weeks of schools reviewing basic math skills: fractions, conversions, basic algebra & trig, literal equations (no numbers/rearranging equations). And still, students may spend a large part of the year seizing up at problem-solving. "
"With my younger sisters and my daughter I encourage them to challenge themselves to promote growth.

"It is my perception that we do as much disservice to high achieving students as to low when we ability group. I see students who are relatively high achieving through elementary school and are thus placed in the \advanced\"" middle school course struggle in a few years. Based on what Boaler has presented, I suspect that many of these students have developed a fixed mindset, and when they are challenged they crumple and decide they aren't good at math after all."""
"More to add to the list of media: videos, magazines, blogs, movies, social media...and adding literatures, too."
agree
"Where, besides TV, do kids get negative ideas about doing math?  They get these ideas from anyone who has done or is currently taking math and not doing well in it.  This can be from older brothers and sisters, parents, relatives, friends and strangers.  It is out there!  When I go to a store and strike up a conversation with a salesperson or employee, I hear þI was not good at math._  It is everywhere."
"In high school, I liked the math -- even word problems or proofs in geometry, etc -- but I hated following the useless rules that seemed to almost always come along with math. Does writing in pencil make my mathematical reasoning so much more effective? (No, but it made my handwriting really sloppy.) "
My fourth graders always like to act like they dread Math (some really do) but usually they are so involved they don't realize it's time to pack up!  I am excited just to think of all I will learn from others here! Especially about tech... And that is one cute baby!
I often hear from students that they are bad at math.  This message essentially tells them to not even bother trying because it is just not in our 'genes'.
I recognize an extreme Didactic Contract as  both a subconscious and a very conscious  tendency to want to do it for the student so that they will always be successful. If they are not successful it would be a direct reflection of my teaching abilities and ME. Parents who teach their own students at home are particularly susceptible to this belief.
"for my all students have the ability to solve problems and to make math clear that given one with the elements are there (prior knowledge) only a matter to be given the opportunity to do, not the teacher wants (with your recipe) but with the creativity of each individual"
"This is a question that I remember my feelings very well, I was feeling that I was not good at math and why try, but since I wanted good grades I did what I could but later ended up taking remedial math but it was a college math teacher that helped me see as well as my roommate who was a math minor that math can be fun and challenging and not a constant sense of failure."
I definitely agree.
"Number talk makes it okay to show how we do a task differently. Many times, students get stuck in a mindset of having to just plug a number into a formula and getting an answer without using their number sense. There are methods behind math and these activities help students explore them. I love that it makes it okay to break numbers apart and thinking differently than peers is encouraged."
"My manager wants the same thing, it is a mistake"
It is interesting how the students have made sense of what they are doing and learning.  They know the value in the math talks and how it has helped them and what it is doing for the students in the class.  They can see how the class is a safe learning environment and how mistakes are viewed as a learning opportunity and a way of helping your classmates.
Life isn't graded. Let's learn math for life.
"We have some very high-powered math learners whose parents demand courses that push them.  We don't have any \low\"" classes per se, though some students start with Algebra 1 and others jump in at Geometry based on their proficiency with basic algebra.  Our geometry and algebra 2 \""regular\"" level classes have very mixed student populations, and I don't think they're being cheated out of rich content.  When we have tried to include the students with weak algebra skills in this group, they did not do well in Algebra 2, and we have also had bad results letting kids who didn't achieve mastery in Algebra 2 go on to Precalculus, anyway.  We do not base placements on a standardized test, and teacher judgement and student results are used to change some placements from one year to the next.  One thing I'm not seeing discussed here is learning style.  It really seems to me that some students need more or less time to internalize new ideas and notations, and I try to frame placement when talking to parents and students as being more about style than ability.  So I think that when not at the mercy of a bureaucracy and high-stakes tests, it is possible to avoid most of the specific factors that cause tracking to result in lower results.  I do agree that we should do a better job of encouraging growth mindset in our accelerated students."""
"The message I would like to give is that each problem should be thought through, discussed if possible, and then understood.  The answer is not important at this point."
I agree- what we say and how we say it -so important!
"I have to media sources that I'd like to share with students around this idea.  One is from the commencement address Denzel Washington gave at U Penn several years ago about the importance of mistakes and failures and the idea of using them to fall forward, not falling back. "
"My understanding of differentiated instruction is that the concept that there is one concept being taught to the class but the work that students do, will most likely be different. The teacher may discreetly give different work to students, or students may get to choose the work that they want to complete. "
You might want to have a look at [this post][1].
"I too would like to know how to fill the gaps that I see with students in my 7th and 8th grade classes.  I want to spent more time exploring concepts so that students can make strong mathematical connections, but I don't know how to do that without sacrificing time to learn other content.  What do we do about the pressure from our school systems to prepare kids for standardized tests?"
FYI-found some good products to help motivate kids (especially younger ones).  Found a couple of books talking about the brain.  This one talks about how making mistakes help your brain grow: Your Fantastic Elastic Brain [Hardcover]
That's an interesting comparison to reading. We would definitely be surprised if someone was so nonchalant about being illiterate. I think that makes it clear that somewhere along the line people decide math (unlike reading) is not useful; at least the math they were taught in school.
"Seriously, I would love to show that clip of the boys talking to both the parents and students in my third grade class - would really show some proof of what I'm trying to achieve."
"Considering the research about brain growth, I will have higher expectations for my students in my Math Tech 2 class that has been labeled as a remedial math class. I will engage them with more challenging problems to encourage more neuron growth."
"The lack of reality in word problems (i.e., applications) is an important issue.  It is important to \connect\"" with the student.  Years ago, early in my career, there was a program called USMES (developed at a university I forget which one during the Federal curriculum development of the 60's) that included \""real world\"" problems.  The need for real world applications, and project-based exercises still dogs mathematics education."""
Thanks <redacted> and <redacted>!
"I agree that time and content coverage constraints force teachers to teach a certain way, but I also believe that with the Common Core and the new assessments from Smarter Balanced and PARCC, which are performance-based and require more higher level thinking, this may be a moot point in a couple of years.  "
"If you are not making mistakes, you are not learning.  We learn more from mistakes than correct answers."
"At one point the boys were asked whether or not they thought the math talks helped them learn math and one boy said \it does and it doesn't\"". I wish that he had been given a chance to explain the \""it doesn't part\"" before everyone talked about how it does help."
"Have high expectations for your son rather than fear. Praise so that he develops a growth mindset. Don't worry about what the other kids, whatever they are, do."
"As a grandparent of an LD student, I often see the expectations of teachers impacting what my grandchild feels she can or cannot do.  When her report card reflects an A in performance but the comments state \does not meet grade level expectations\"", I question how I am to interpret this.  I was told it was for the child's self-esteem.  Clearly, my grandchild knows she is not working at the level of most of her classmates.  I feel this message tells my granddaughter that she isn't worth the effort.  I feel helpless to change that mindset - which is why I am participating in this seminar."""
"Here's a case where the ends definitely do not justify the means. The means is the journey, and the journey is full of mistakes which make the journey. Have students reflect on and share some journey, any journey towards a goal whether it be learning academics, skill or a physical place and have them share stories of how the mistakes made along the way were something valuable they remembered and took away from them."
"Hi, I too am a middle school math teacher in Essex, Vermont.  Im curious about how you collaborate with the university research center as we have a university nearby and I would love to collaborate with them."
I left my notes from Emily and Sophie as they got me thinking. 
But should not receive a label
Grade 2  State Goal:  Obj. 2.OA.B. 2 
Some people just  clicked that it was acceptable and didn't bother to write anything. But at least we get through the pile faster!
"As I was listening to this video, I was thinking of how the research would apply to our adult students.  Many of our native English speakers were probably assigned to lower-ability groups in their early school years and missed out on more challenging learning opportunities.  Many of our non-native English speakers may have been grouped in their home countries or refugee camps based on gender or family status.  However, their goals are now the same -- to pass the GED tests.  Our program currently groups students primarily by standardized reading and/or math test results.  Although this is probably for practical reasons of limited time and resources, it may also be because no one has figured out a better way.  Any suggestions would be appreciated."
"A lot of people seem to be posting their answers to all questions that are asked in the videos, and there doesn't seem to be so much a discussion as a huge influx of information. Of course, the sorting of the information depends on each individual poster and some content is certainly getting posted in strange places! I, too, am having difficulty sorting through all the posts to find ones I'd like to read and respond to."
When did mathematics take this kind of a turn? How long have we been off course?
i have the same issue. take a look at the update on some platform issues discussion topic. they are fixing some bugs.
"At one of the schools I taught at the grade level (elementary) teachers began to have \math classes\"" for the parents, to teach them what they were teaching the children.  These were like twice a month and helped some to overcome a \""misunderstanding\"" many of the parents had regarding math.  It also helped them to \""learn\"" math, so that they were able to help their children.  The other effect of this was that it raised the self-esteem of the parents, so that they didn't feel ignorant around their children.  "
"I was able to get my students to make more than the national average progress without homework last year.  I use computers to provide immediate feedback, and I am freed up to coach students more, so class time is better utilized.  I agree that 6 hours a day is enough."
I don't see a survey.
"I went to all girl's school in my home country from preK all the way to 7th grade, we were all expected to be the best of the best at subject. It wasn't until I started going to school in the US in the co-ed school that I start to see that the boys would get more attention in math and the science classes than the girls. I had to prove that I was just as capable as the boys."
I think that the lack of foundation is the main reason for the data that was shared.  There hasn't been a systematic streamlined foundational building path for students and/or teachers to follow.
"My elementary school does all heterogeneous grouping and we have multiple classrooms at each grade level. We have been discussing for a few years now if there is a better way to group our students as each classroom has a huge range of learners. After seeing this research, I think the answer is that we need more differentiated instruction within our own rooms and keep them heterogeneous."
I am forever pointing out where Maths comes in to our lives at school and at home. Another change of mindset is needed to think this way
I agree with you because in 1st grade is the best time to give mindset and they will succede in math in future
"This forum should accept SVG format images. Especially for a course that discusses math but doesn't have an equation editor, I would prefer to have infinitely scalable vector graphics instead of fixed-size bitmaps. Currently, I have to choose between having high-resolution images that don't hurt my eyes, or small images that don't bloat the screen size for small devices."
"It is just like design thinking... analyzing a situation, finding out what is needed, making a prototype/drawing, seeing what worked and what didn't.  Revising as necessary and stoping to think all along the way.  Getting peer feedback, thinking, revising, and creating a new prototype.  All the while, asking does it make sense?  This simple question is crucial and more students need to ingrain that important step in their heads.  So many errors can be eliminated that way."
I was interested that  they said it was fun and that they felt a freedom to do what they want with the math problem.  I was also struck by their lack of fear of making a mistake as the Math Talk and class sharing would explain to them what they did wrong.
"Just an idea ... the students could use rubber bands or string to bundle those sticks into groups of 10 (and then 10 groups of 10 into 100, and so on) so that they can make more sense of numbers.  Manipulating groups of 10 (or knowing how to get to a group of 10) makes working with numbers easier, and gives understanding to our number system based on 10."
I would say to my students:
"I just started Session 5 and I had a lot of difficulty watching the first video. The scrolling background made it hard for me to watch and concentrate on what I was hearing/reading.  Maybe this is because I am prone to headaches/seasickness, but I would think it has a similar effect on at least some watchers.  I would \vote\"" against using a scrolling background in future videos, especially in the course for students."""
Hello!
"Hello,"
Hi All.
"Could we use writing in the classroom as a means of differentiating? It would allow students to express their thoughts and allow them to hear their thoughts from a different perspective. Sometimes students just need to \air out\"" their thoughts, and the writing is a great way to process their learning."""
I went to a selective girls school so I am pleased to say that I didn't receive any such messages at achool.
We are all mathematicians. We can all learn math. Math is about thinking. Math is fun. There is more than one way to arrive at the answer.
"Hi Ladies!  I, too, teach elementary math - in Fairfax and Arlington Counties.   Are you interested in joining a Google+ community of educators in DC& MD/VA suburbs to talk amongst ourselves a little more about the class? I set one up called (DMV) Math Collaborative <zipRedac>72<zipRedac>13.  It is a private group right now, but hopefully you can find it and request to join.  If not, e-mail me with your Google+ (or GMail) profile name and I'll add you. "
"I agree, we may never be as interesting as a video game but that's no reason *not* to apply yourself and be engaged in learning."
"One of the many ideas/messages I will share from this course (thus far) is the synapses and the development of the brain. I will explain it, then show the class the video here, so they don't think it's just my own opinion. I'm planning to show this video to parents on our school's Parents Night as well, to solicit help from the parents to embrace the power within mistake-making. I am SO happy that I'm a part of this course, so I can share what I'm learning."
I thought I would share the poem I wrote and submitted for Question 3.9. Any feedback would be appreciated. I'd like to start the school year with a discussion about this poem.
"Hi Yvonne,"
"Becoming aware that what we are saying to a student may convey a stereotypical response is a start.  Before we respond or interact with a student, we could take a thoughtful moment to ensure our response is not conveying a stereotypical messages.  In other words, become attuned and aware of the problem and our role in it."
"Good morning, I am a elementary math coach.  I am always looking forward to learning new things and hope that I can use them to help students succeed, especially in math."
Listening to this section caused me great anxiety. I work in a district that requires us to give timed tests for math facts. It is the worst 3 minutes of the week for most of my students as well as myself. I see confident students with tears in their eyes during those 3 minute. I have done everything possible to take away the stress and anxiety for these tests but it still causes the students extreme stress. I would love to find a way that I could assess the students (and keep the district happy) without causing so much hardship for the students.
"The teacher encouraged thinking near the beginning of the video by telling students that they could look for a second method if they finished finding one. With the student who got the wrong answer originally, she encouraged him to identify his own error, and reacted to it positively. Students were encouraged, but not forced to share. In cases where students misspoke, she said \let me rewind you\"", and asked for clarification, rather than stating that they had said it wrong."""
"I completely agree about \free\"" being surprising. One of the boys responded that math was not all about rules, which is great to hear, and different from what I expected."""
"Yes - like everyone else, I loved what the boys said about mathematics. In response to the previous task I said that I hoped they felt able to explore mathematics in various ways, etc, but these boys exceeded my expectations! If only all children had such happy and useful mathematical experiences."
I am getting some sound but it is so soft that I need to read the captions at the same time as listening
1)  I have understood the difference between adding fractions with the same denominator and adding fractions with different denominators and know when to use different strategies.
"While listening to this video, I could identify with several of the thoughts/emotions. While I never spent time in the corner until I learned my math facts, I think I spent lots of time in the corner of my mind dreading to be called to the board in front of peers to solve the \NEXT MATH PROBLEM.\""  By the time I reached college, I had learned how to avoid math at all cost.  I would only take the required areas of math.  Strange, I always made \""A\"" in math, but never believed I knew Math.  I know I never \""understood\"" math, I just memorized the facts, figured out what the teacher wanted me to repeat and stayed as quiet in class as possible. Isn't it strange, like in this video, how successful people (women) are in the workplace, yet we still reflect on the time we didn't do well in math.  I laughed with the video at the memory, yet could also sense the weight it still carried in the speakers life.  As a teacher, I trust I'm never a part of that segment of anyone's memory."""
If all that happened for the folks in the video was to hear how each
I have the same thing happening - I think it's just that session 1 tasks are being graded excessively slowly.....
"So much evidence out there suggests that ability grouping assists both ends of the learning spectrum, and then so much more evidence comes to light about the benefits of mixed classes, it is actually very confusing to know which path to take."
People can gain an understanding of all the different ways there is to look at a problem.  
"That is really what i see here in our area as well.  The struggles in mathematics seem to perpetuate themselves.  Such a shame that those fears, myths, and misconceptions are passed on for generations."
I just got the same response and I'm not sure what needs to be done.
"10x +12y only write if I knew, from the statement that per kg of apples cost 10 cents and 12 cents per kg of pears. I find it ambiguous problem enunciation."
"I teach 9th grade algebra, at my school we offer 2 algebra classes one regular algebra and one course that is algebra over 2 years. Let's set aside the issue that moving more slowly will not help these students catch up on their math skills. From the first day of class I hear messages from these students about their being stupid at math. Many students half way through the year realize that they will not be able to move on to geometry the next year because of the algebra class they were placed in and get very discouraged. I find it very frustrating that students are sorted this way. There has been discussion about eliminating the slower algebra from the administration, however, I am the only teacher in the math department that wants to see that happen. There is very strong opinion from the other math teachers that they don't want to get rid of the tracked classes."
"Here in Ontario we have \academic\"" and \""applied\"" streams for math, as well as other subjects. However, I worked at an independent school this past year where they only had \""academic\"" and all students were put in this group. I did find this much more challenging however, because many students that were in this group found the material very challenging and would have probably benefitted much better if they had been taught the material in the Applied curriculum. Although I do agree that having a fixed mindset is not good and your hard work is #1, I also do think that some students are naturally better at math than others."""
"I made a mistake.  Let's see what I learned from it.  I looked at the triangles, and saw they were growing, and at a very fast rate.  I counted the cubes, 4, 8, 16 and saw a dpubling pattern.  So I assumed that it was a doubling pattern to the hundredth number."
"Adam, I am sorry your sixth grade Math teacher told you your brain was not wired the right way.  If only children could be more like Michael Jordan-- tuning out the negative talk and abuse.  If all children could believe in themselves, no matter what the trusted bullies said.  Can you imagine what would have happened, if Michael Jordan really believed he was not good enough for basketball, when he was cut from the varsity basketball team?  I have often wondered how that coach feels-- with the fame and recognition Michael Jordan has for his expertise in basketball."
Learning is not about speed. It is attempting difficult issues until a solution is found. Learning and attempting mastery over our challenges is what we do every moment in our lives!
"I noticed that Cathy encouraged the students to see the problem in different ways, and gave time to think. She had the students explain thoroughly their thought process in solving the problem. Drawing a picture of the solution showed it visually, and she encouraged the students to work together."
"Hello everyone! I am a high school math teacher in northern Virginia about 30 miles west of Washington, D.C. I have a wide range of teaching experiences, and love using technology in the classroom. This past year I \flipped\"" my Geometry course; notes done at home via video, and homework done in class. I couldn't have done it without the support of my principal, department chair, and tech department, as well as the incredible #flipclass community on Twitter."
"In the last example, I'd probably say: $20 imes29=20(20+((4+4)+1))$ shows the distibutive propery a bit better algebraically, if one can track the parentheses. And then I'd wonder if there's a better way to draw the geometric representation."
"I agree with <redacted>.  My students would not describe math as lacking rules or a \free\"". Nor would they have such a positive attitude toward the subject."
"I too have witnessed math being taught like humanitarian science which is very sad. For me math is the only universal language there is and it's the easiest way to share what's going on inside your head. You know - all the decisions and judgments you make - it's usually hard to describe the actual thinking process. Mathematics presents us with the right tool set to do exactly that - put on paper the actual thinking process. It also develops your analytic thinking which in turns help you make real-life decisions. You may never need in life to solve trigonometric equations (for instance) but the thinking that you develop after solving them, would lead you to put the skills into life. "
They saw the extension to other kinds of thinking.
"After viewing this video I thought back to my school years and I was \fortunate\"" to have 2 Mrs. Glass (Mrs. Tutt- 2nd grade, Mrs. Brown-9th grade).  I think what makes math so intimidating is the mind set.  We've been taught that there is no other answer or way to answer a math question than what it has always been known to be.  Personally, I abhorred math when I was in school- I only learned to like it in college, and as a teacher.  But when I see my students struggling with a concept, I work with them even more to make sure that they have the support needed to understand math."""
"I'll try to remind my students that every time they make a mistake and take the time to figure out what to change, they are growing their brains. So when they are frustrated, I'll reiterate, \Look at how your brain is growing right now! Keep up the good work.\"""""
"On the videos of classes working together , you saw how it can work.  Students communicate and participate together solving problems.  Extra or more complex work can be waiting there in the wings, if some group finishes fast...or the problem can be open ended...with variations to develop...I know it sounds like a dream or a terrible mistake but I think it can work and will try in my classes..."
I think that dot card number talks allow people to see that numbers can be grouped in many different ways.  It allows for flexibility in thinking and yet shows also the similarity in all of the methods that are used.
IF all teachers buy-in to changing school culture then this idea of changing students success will be successful... but what about the continued damage done by educators and parents that will not support the idea that all kids can learn?
"I liked the visual representations, too.    And I agree about the validation of their thinking.  If they didn't want to present their idea this time, they might feel comfortable next time.  I really like your whole comment."
"I am not surprised by the research, and I agree that all students deserve the opportunity to have rich math classes where they are involved in problem solving, experimenting, defending their work - struggling, thinking, collaborating - but how we will combat the whole system of passively taking in facts and knowledge?  Unless ALL of their classes become so directed, math will continue to just feel \too hard.\"""""
Main Ideas: Students should be given project-based math that is related to real life examples.  We use math constantly in our everyday lives and don't even realize it because we don't consider it math.
You can see how your students are processing things.
"Try, try again!  If at first you don't succeed, try try again!"
"I agree with you, Janet, but I do think that the importance should be focused more on the earlier academic years than the college years as to why this is happening.  However, i do see that in order to address the gaps and/or poor relationships with math, that colleges need to have a variety of access points for their students."
"I think 1.6 is broken, several people, including me, have stated that they have grade several more there, and the number doesn't go down at all."
I am facing the same problem as you!
Perhaps this is the problem: I can't find any reset button under the text box. My OS is winXP and I'm using Chrome (but with Firefox it's just the same).
"Might I suggest you write your response using something like \notepad\"" while you cycle between spots on the video, then copy and paste into the submission box when you're done?"
Would you be willing to give a bit more information about your idea?  What generalizations are you thinking? Do you have other cases in mind when dealing with reciprocals? :) Thanks
"Students can be surrounded by messages about the difficulty of math. Because this belief is so prevalent in our culture, the message can appear at any moment. Adults with negative views of math are quick to share their stories. Students might hear some of these messages from their peers or parents. These messages are sometimes perpetrated, perhaps inadvertently, by some who are successful in mathematics. If a child struggling with an idea asks a peer, only to hear, þYou don_t get that? That_s so easy,_ it only reinforces their own inadequacy and supports the alternate message in the air, that it definitely is not easy, you either get it or you don_t."
Math is everywhere
The focus on getting thru a span of content is so frustrating.  I'm not sure that getting thru content if only half the students understand it counts.  How can we challenge these mandates?  How can we focus on what students actually learn rather than how much gets 'covered'?
...that open new doors to understanding.\

"It has occurred to me after submitting my response to the second question that perhaps high-achieving girls are more likely to develop fixed mindsets because so many people try to compensate for society's stereotypes about girls with extra praise.  When girls get good grades, I have noticed that many well-meaning adults will tell them how \smart\"" they are instead of using some of the other phrasing mentioned in the video clip.  How different their perception could be if parents, teachers, and peers reacted differently!"""

What you are doing was not done for some of my students who are having difficulty.  The good news from this session is that I can do number talks with those students and help them to develop the number sense that is missing.
"It really hows the number of different, but equally correct ways of solving even a very simple problem. Analysing the similarities at the end is also helpful as students can see the different flavors of the same methods."
"There are still many teachers in U.S. classrooms who have been steeped in the \Learning Styles\"" movement.  Thus, different students have different strengths, preferences, talents, and/or gifts.  So, we assessed and evaluated our students and determined that some of them did not have a **math** learning style strength so they were steered away from engaging in math work - except for the bare necessity of learning to add, subtract, etc.  So, the message received was that he or she wasn't any good at math.  Don't bother."""
"I would like to practice what I preach. However, when I make a math mistake or struggle to solve a challenging problem I still have a physical response. I start to sweat, I become anxious and I freeze up. My goal is to persist the next time I'm faced with a problem."
I slap think it is important for them to know the vocabulary to talk accurately.

"Cathy was very positive about everyone participating - encouraging 'someone who hasn't spoken yet' to try next steps.  She also used the thumb 'readiness' system (instead of hands up), this probably reduced stress so that students could take awhile to think.  She did allow a relatively long time for the last problem."
"The best thing you can gain is realize that people have different strategies, different points of view, and all of them are acceptable, right and correct."
Many parents tell their children that they don't understand math at all.  The children follow the parents and feel it is ok to give up without trying harder.
"I was not surprised to learn the percent of community college students who needed to enroll in remedial math courses.  I was surprised, however, to learn how many students do not complete their AA, and that math is the primary roadblock.   I teach Algebra to eighth graders, and am worried that many of them are headed toward serious difficulty in achieving their educational goals because of their struggles with my course.  I do not want to be their \Mrs. Glass\"".  "
"The students in that class may explain that math is manipulating numbers in different ways, following some mathematical rules, to come up with a solution."
"I think all the above factors are combined, creating this huge problem that arises in most our schools."
"In this number talk, Cathy:"
I would tell students at the beginning of the year about an exciting new study which proved that people get smarter when they make mistakes.  I would tell the students that I expect them and myself to make mistakes in class during the year and that by looking at the mistake and figuring out what makes it wrong is the best way to help me learn new math content.
"The kids seem very comfortable and at eases talking about math.  They love being \free\"" to solve a problem any way they want.  They understand that seeing how other kids solve problems helps them think about their own strategies.  I was surprised at how comfortable they were with making mistakes.  As far as they were concerned it went along with the territory, so to speak.  Every one makes mistakes when they do math.  You just keep plugging along. They didn't think of decomposing a problem or creating friendly numbers to add or multiply as tedious work, or time consuming.  They enjoyed doing it.  They have confidence in themselves as problem solvers of math.  They have a very positive attitude about math."""
"Giving students an opportunity to see that people view problems differently is important.  Even with something as simple as grouping objects together, there can be multiple strategies.  I think that as math teachers, we want our students to be interested in the process and journey that math offers, and less concerned about knowing \the right answer.\""  These types of activities illuminate thinking processes and strategies, engaging students in that wonderment of multiple roads that lead to the same answer."""
"The culture of being \stupid\"" is popular... television, movies, and music that give the message that being a geek or know-it-all is uncool, are too pervasive and allow the younger generation to believe that they do not have to reach a standard of achievement that the adults seemingly place upon them."""
The speed issue is Hugh in learning math. Stress from speed needs to be replaced with the idea of the importance of taking the time needed to go deeper in understand concepts.
"At my school, there are not extreme boundaries on the groups that are established.  I teach at a public high school.  Students can simply check a box if they want to be in the honors class.  We have AVID at our school, which requires students to take at least one honors class every school year.  Thus, students simply choose which class they want to take as an honors class.  This causes the honors classes to actually be a mix of \abilities.\""  The regular classes also have a wide range of students since students can choose not to be in an honors class if they don't want to.  I believe the research when it says that tracking often causes lower achievement in students.  I totally believe that teachers' expectations change based on the title of the class (honors, co-teach, pre-ap, etc.).  I can see it in myself, and I have to be consistently aware of these mindsets that can affect my treatment of students."""
I agree.  Feedback and progress allows growth.  Yet implies future attainment.  Challenge allows an extension of ability.
"Your experience addresses mine with my DD (very slow to process, needing much persistence).  Thank you for the link."
I did this method as well :)
"Another grade 8 Ontario teacher here.  I am very curious about the similarities and differences in approach across the continent and around the world, and one thing I would love to do is see about setting up some connections between classrooms in different places so we could get our students talking together online, just as we are doing here."
I agree that they viewed it as a mentally freeing subject. We call a friendly number a 'tidy' number because they tidy equations and are easy to use. I like the term 'friendly' though. It's interesting that they saw their teacher as the one who taught them the strategies to use and what we saw are kids using those teacher taught strategies. They were proud of their abilities in maths and confident. We see this all the time when young students are taught number strategies. kids will confidently use names fro strategies as soon as they understand what the names stand for.
"Listening to Nick's highly motivated students talk to our instructor made me wonder about ways to entice oppositionally defiant kids into the math meme. However, I found it most interesting that Nick's students were so highly cognizant of their own thinking about mathematics and were able to clearly distinguish between conceptual math or \thinking about ideas\"" and blinding following rules without reasons."""
"I'm grateful that so many parents are part of the class. I keeping thinking of the many parents who've told me they were terrible at math, don't like math, or don't know enough to help their children. This class offers a wonderful opportunity for parents to get the support they may need to get involved in their children's math learning."
I would like to start with a discussion on how the brain works. It think it is important for students to realize that we are building connections and that sometimes it takes time to build connections. It takes practice and mistakes are going to be made and that is how we will know that learning is taking place.
"Don't forget to tell also the students about Thomas Alva Edison, the famous and greatest inventor."
They are important to give perspective and insight into how others think.  They also encourage you to think outside your standard or customary way...to try something new yourself when you see others visualizing things differently.
"I remember hearing the stereotype that girls aren't good at math all the way up to college. Even one of my parent's friends who was an elementary school principal told me that I probably wouldn't do so well in a college statistics class because those classes \are more difficult for girls\"". I was quite happy to go on and get an \""A\"" in that class. I'm hoping that we are going to be able to turn that around for today's students. I currently teach at a high poverty/low performing elementary school. We are working hard to help our students believe (even at the Kinder level) that they can be successful in all subjects so that they can go to college some day if they choose that path."""
I agree too
"I posted his link in a separate post! But here it is, just in case it's easier for some people to find. :) "
I work with teachers and I want to find ways to help teachers understand that all children can learn and there is a lot of new information that can help us as teachers to find ways to reach all students.
One of the most important messages that I would want students to hear at the beginning of the year is that our classroom is a safe environment for testing ideas. Critiquing math solutions does not mean that you are attacking the individual. I would also want to start a video journal where students could record their individual feelings about the two mindsets and return to this video journal later in the year to determine which mindset helped them grow more mathematically.
A video in the resources shows a living example of brain plasticity. 
The students enjoy the freedom to find different means for one solution. It thus invigorated them to actively participate and learn.
"To understand maths you need a good teacher.Not one who  knows many theorems, who can write on the table different problems, but one who can communicate with the children and be a friend of them."
I think that the student who expressed that 10 is a friendly number has internalized that he frequently decomposes 10 or rounds to the closest 10 in order to make a problem more friendly.  This is a task that demonstrates number sense.
"One thing I do with my 8th graders is to award class points for a variety of desired behaviors.  Points are used to earn whole-class rewards.  I award a point for every math mistake I make that they catch before I do.  This helps reduce math anxiety, since even the teacher goofs up sometimes.  It increases their attention to detail, and is pretty fun when they catch one."
"I believe in my humble opinion, that geometry and algebra go hand in hand.  They need to be integrated and taught together.  Our world does not separate the two, why should teachers?"
"It wasn't discussed necessarily in this video, (briefly by Sophie) but one of the most damaging messages I've heard about math is that is isn't used in the \real world\"". I cannot even tell you how many times I heard EVERY DAY \""Why are we learning this?\"" or \""When I am going to use this?\"" I understand that most professions will not require their workers to be able to find the area between a curve and the x-axis, but math, in my opinion, is more about the process than the answer. Along those lines, I do feel that most professions wants their employees to be good at problem-solving, thinking logically, and breaking down works into smaller, yet necessary steps to achieve a final goal."""
I would like to start student off with some of the brain research about brain growth. Then I would like for them to individually reflect on why it is important to feel safe making mistakes. We would have a class discussion to determine what we can do/not do to create this safe feeling in our classroom and let them create their own posters. Then we will determine how we can monitor the classroom culture so the safe feeling is not violated.
"I just thought I would mention that I started reading Jo Boaler's book, \What's Math Got To Do With It?\"" when I decided to take this class - I would highly recommend it.  The book and this class are going to be one of the best 'professional development' decisions I have made in a long time!"""
"I could divide students into small groups (two stronger students with two lower-ability students) to design domino cards that show different groupings of dots to add up to a particular number.  As I walk around the classroom and observe the small groups working together, I can give reminders that everyone in the group needs to contribute something.  If one student is thinking of the combinations of dots, another student can be drawing the actual dots.  As I continue to walk and observe, I can be sure to offer positive comments and compliments as to how well everyone is working together on  a project.  I appreciate all of the different ideas as well as the good teamwork and the artistic efforts.  If the lower-ability students are coloring the dots, they are still seeing the different ways to form a number even if they are not doing the actual thinking.  They have received the praise they need to hear also.  When we come together at the end of the session to share the dominoes, we can talk about how we all worked together and everyone contributed something to the small group project.  We can use the dominoes for games throughout the year."
"One of the teacher moves that Kathy uses a lot in that number talk is asking for clarification. She doesn't try to lead the students to where she thinks they are going or where she wants them to be, she just asks for clarification. She also doesn't say that students are right or wrong, she just asks if others agree or have a different answer. She also asks for all the different ways people figured out their answer."
"My name is Sheila and I work in a teacher preparation program. I struggle with teacher candidates teaching math for understanding when they don't have a strong background in mathematics and many of the concepts they have memorized and don't really understand (fractions, decimals, percents)."
I agree with this.
"I believe all of those answers share in the role of the shocking statistics but I would say the people who are responsible are the teachers!  I have taught a wide spectrum of students from 7th grade up to Junior College level and even those students that don't like math or had difficulties with math previously, can still learn math and have done beautiful math in my class.  It takes the right way to explain something and unfortunately with so many kids in one class it is very difficult to reach every students' teaching style."
"Message that my daughter experiences is simply that she is slow at \getting it\"" - she is slow at memorizing times tables or needs repetition before \""getting it\""."""
- I have had students who come to me with the perception that since they have slow processing they are not good at math
"I noticed that Cathy never told students that they had a wrong answer. She documented everything on the board. The studets were the ones who saw their own mistakes. I noticed that at the beginning she set the tone by saying \Get ready to think\"", and then if they were quick to answer, she encouraged them to see it in a different way. She asked students to share their answers while she writes and then later comes back to get them to explain their strategies. They were encouraaed to discuss her question of associative or distributive properties in a group, not individually."""
"Teaching algebra, I had students come to me from a Montessori school, and each was so ill equipped to handle the challenge of algebra, it really left me wondering about the philosophy....I still don't know enough about it, or anything to make a different judgement."
"I like it. As a science teacher, I'd make it a math/science/tinkerer biography. What do you do with them?"
"The \Discussions\"" link in the course navigation panel at the top of the page will take you to the forum.  Also, take a look at [this post][1] to get more help on using this course:)"
Easy clear example to show to any age or ability to show there is more than 1 right answer / method
"I agree.  I found it more difficult to explain my thinking for the question in session 4.  As a matter of fact, I like the question so much I will use a version in class this year.."
"Currently working as a math teacher in high school in Colombia. Well, I think I'm a little lost with this in the forums because my language is not English, in any case try to catch up."
"Here in the UK, we start simple algebra at age 10."
"how about timed tests that aren't graded, but done for fun, competing with oneself.  perhaps the bigger issue to convince schools then is why everything has to be graded when it ruins true education!!"
"I think negative messages come from many sources, but I believe most of it comes from the home and from peers.  Sometimes parents may struggle helping their children with homework or an older sibling may complain about how hard math is in their grade level or how they hated doing what the younger sibling is doing when they were in that particular grade. Younger children will buy in to what their peers' opinions are."
"I am a fifty-something going back to finish my degree and I was always told \girls CAN\""T do math.\""  I believed for a long time.  I find Algebra amazing and want to learn all of it.  Still have fears, but that is why I am here."""
"We all have that one thing that comes to mind when we hear of different topics, places or even people. That one word, phrase, message or idea is what created a lasting impression, even years after the said thing was witnessed or heard. Sadly, if the memory is a negative one, that is the perception of that place whenever the name is mentioned, while if it was a positive message whenever the name is mentioned a smile would adorn the face. "
"I agree with your answers... was looking for the explanations though! :) I'm struggling to conceptualize the last problem (I know the algorithm, but would like to see different approaches)"
yes . It should be 150 + 30 and not 130 as shown in the last line above the diagram
It's a great way to begin a discussion of the numerous ways in which to approach a problem.
Convince me!
"B is definitely a reason, but how do students reach this point? One contributing factor is methods."
I frequently used to apply a didactic contract where the students were sticking in finding  a right answer for different activities in math. So I used to give them my  support to find the right answer by providing them with some hints or clues not by ( spoon feeding ) that guide them to solve the problem correctly. So my didactic contract was where the activities were exercised and students' mathematical knowledge  was  developed.
Hello everyone!i'<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Arizona and I teach the Pre-K students.I have taught in different grades in the past so I am hoping to get inspired from this course and then insprire parents and students!
"I'm curious about this too.  I want to help students who have attention issues or learning disabilities.  This video tells us that we teachers can disrupt the trajectory of students who haven't had challenging experiences.  If anyone has successful strategies, please share!"
I don't think you can blame socioeconomics.  Kids at all incomes succeed and fail in math.
And then it's scary to think that one's ability as a teacher will be judged by the test scores!
My middle school students often relate that their mom is not good at math.  I think they hope this statement justifies their perceived weakness or offers an excuse for a poor performance. During parent teacher conferences I have had parents tell me they were not good at math and they have minimum expectations for their child in my math class.
Negative messages are prevalent though out our  society.  It's a belief that is passed down from generation to generation in families and communities.
"I never really understood fractions until I started teaching. With the 'tricks' I was taught and not the understanding of the fractions, I never could tell which was greater or less. It took hands-on manipulatives, plates, and graph paper for me to even begin to tell and show my students."
"Hello!  I am a full-time math instructor in a Learning Lab at a Mississippi community college and have 18 years of teaching experience.    I work with students in one-to-one and small group settings.  Students do not enroll in a course that I teach, rather they come to me voluntarily for free assistance with their math course(s).  I try to be approachable and comfort my students who struggle with math so that they know that I am on their side.  At the beginning of each day, I never know what math I will be teaching to my students.  I could be doing basic math, algebra, trig, calculus, or differential equations.  More often than not, I have a little bit of everything going on all at the same time as I jump back and forth between multiple students and groups.  Each day is different and exciting."
"I'm looking forward to bringing this learning to my staff.  I want to encourage them to spread these messages in their classrooms as well as encourage mistake making as a staff.  I have been tossing around the idea of having time in faculty meetings to talk with each other about risks that we took each week and talk about mistakes that were made.  In doing this, teachers may be able to talk about what they learned from these risks and mistakes, as well as get ideas from their peers."
I just have to comment about all that I have learned so far from these talks has totally changed my perspective on teaching math for my upcoming 7th grade class! I can't wait to finish these sessions!
Inappropriate teacher responses to mistakes
I am now trying to get my students with me on the thought that what we will be studying are not methods and procedures but mistakes and what we can learn from them. This is not easy all the time but I think that referring to the brain research will help. After all - doesn_t everybody want their brain to grow as quick as possible?!
Math is such an important part of our world!! We need to help all students feel confident as they ponder and question why in any subject especially math.  Students need to work together to solve meaningful world problems. The role of the teacher is to alleviate anxiety in learning and to help all students grow.
"In my classroom some of my Students claim that since their parents were not good at math, they will not be good at math either. Some even say that their parents told them they don_t need math to make money!"
Hello
I felt the exact same way--flexibility and creativity are not aspects I usually associate with math.
From a teacher's perspective it provides valuable feedback as to how a particular student views/thinks his or her way through math. Sharing the different methods with students gives them a deeper understanding of how to solve future problems.  Teaching them that there is more than one way to perceive math.  This ultimately encourages creativity in thinking about math which as we now know is critical to gaining that deeper understanding.
"Loved all 3 problems.  The first 2 came to me quickly.  Problem 3 made me struggle, but I persevered and got a similar result."
"Hi Megan,"
"Montessori schooling is a lot like homeschooling, however, homeschooling allows the family to truly individualize.  I do believe that certain basic skills and standards have to be incorporated into the Montessori methods.  I have also taught students from Montessori schools who had gaps in learning.  However, I do not have experience in any Montessori school."
parets are the worst!
Nice poster.
"I'm not at all surprised by the information and data, and it supports my concern about the way math learning is approached in schools by many. This connects strongly with my reasons for taking this course, and with my experiences as a teacher, math coach, and even more profoundly, as a learner. I currently serve as an elementary math specialist for a state dept. of education (Georgia) and have had the same fear as of being found out as not being \good\"" at math as did Vivienne Parry, and frequently felt not smart enough to be doing what I do. After many emotional conversations with my lovely engineer husband (whose dad was a maths prof at University of London), he has helped me to realize I'm different at math. I have many holes in my mathematics understanding which I am constantly attempting to fill, and I need a constant reference to the concrete in order to develop real understanding of concepts. I've \""come out\"" and openly discuss this with teachers in the hope that it will allow them to be more vulnerable about their own math issues. I have been encouraged by my husband to embrace the positive view that my thinking allows me to readily relate to student misconceptions and student ways of thinking. While I hoped this course would help me in my communication with and support of teachers, I didn't anticipate that it would also move me to tears. Thank you!"""
Hi Janet! 
I have a difficult time accepting that all the teachers of these 90% have the inability to effectively teach math.
I believe it is important for students to recognize that it is 10 cents and 12 cents. I think there is value in writing .1 or .10v and .12 w
The most common cultural norms I am faced with as a teacher is the acceptance that some people are just bad a math and this can not be avoided or changed. It is very difficult to overcome this with students because it is so entrenched in their identity and often times accepted by the parents as well.
"Hi!  My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I have been teaching special education for the past 14 years.  I have taught in the primary grades in the past.  I live just outside of Carlsbad, CA, and have two children (one in elementary and the other starting middle school).  "
"-From other adults who have had traumatic math experiences (teachers, parents, relatives, etc)"
It's important to see the different methods of finding the answer and validating each students perspective.
"Most of them, the get the negative messages from their parents, family or friends. You have the \Genetic Transmission\"", from parents that did bad at maths, to sons and daughters that, fo course, can't do any better. This applies also to relatives and family in general. And, then of course, friends who, speaking about their own experience, can damage the self-confidence, biuld stereotypes about not only the subject but also about several teachers, and so on."""
"I've taught this lesson before . . . after looking at a different size square, the methods are then generalized into expressions that can be used to find the border of any sized square.  Once each method is written as an expression, each can then be simplified.  Once simplified, they are all equivalent.  My students participated well with this lesson and made connections and were engaged, up until we started simplifying.  I lost them at that point.  Different teachers will pace the discussion differently.  Also, different teaching methods reach different students.  I did have more engagement, participation, and learning with this lesson than I did with the majority of my other lessons."
"I stated this already in another thread, but feel that primary teachers are getting a bad wrap here. While there may be some primary teachers who are not comfortable with teaching math just as there are teachers who are not comfortable with teaching reading. I think the problem lies in the fact that we are required to be \jacks of all trades, master of none\"". Why don't primary teachers just teach one content area?"""
"I have had parents tell me that its okay for \Susie\"" not to do well because they never und_rstood math. I finally got tired of hearing this and once added, \""would you ever tell anyone you couldn't read well and that was okay?\"""""
1.  I can use derivatives to calculate various rates of change.
:) I could help but enjoy your comment!
"Was the open-problem vs traditional problem classroom study a study of regular sized classes, 25 to 30 pupils in each? - so many reseach studies seem to be on artificially reduced class sizes and these intriguing approaches seem hard to apply to large classes, partly I'm sure through fear of derailing by unruly pupils."
"I feel your pain in fighting time,tests, and the race to cover the material.  I too am hoping to learn how to balance the competing approaches."
"I might play a game of squeeze with my students with them all holding hands in a circle.  They can pass a squeeze around the circle.  (When someone squeezes their left hand, they squeeze the person's hand on their right.)  Just to demonstrate how quickly it can go around the circle.  Then change the pattern of the squeeze.  When it comes back around, see if the pattern is the same as when it left the first squeeze.  Discuss why it may have changed.  Discuss what happened.  Why did the squeeze change?  (Your brain learned to change!)  Ask if this was a mistake... If so, what did you think when the new squeeze came around.  Talk about mistakes having power to change (and grow!) your brain."
Same problem. Don't knok.
"I think the focus for each country adds to this as well. In the US the focus has been on Literacy and math has been put on the back burner, but now we realize that only about 50% of the students meet standards each year in math."
"I have heard negative messages communicated by parents to their child....\I wasn't good at math either\"".  Also, by support staff in schools, \""I never really understood that either\"".  I also think kids themselves don't persevere through it so they get negative messages from their peers as well."""
<redacted> O_O  Did you have to pay to get in? :D
I found this part to your response interesting
One primary source of negative messages about math is parents. They tell their kids they can't help them with their math without trying and that they were poor in math and the child will be too.
"I guess I knew I'd never be great at math when my mom told me as a child that my teacher explained to her: \I know that if <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> gets a math concept, everyone gets it.\"" And my mom passed that comment on to me!!!"""
"Here, here.  In an ideal world,not grouping students by abilities would be wonderful.  But most teachers I know deal with large, mixed classes and there is not enough teacher power to give each student individualized attention.  We work our best and hardest at differentiation but with classes of 30+ kids and one teacher it is near impossible."
this seems similar to our school
"I agree, we also do not do any grouping at all at"
"Hello,"
"The dot card talks helps realize how we tend to use regularity in representation to subitize how many objects we see, and that there's many way to see the same thing.  Everybody will end with the same number, but the path they talk about gives other new way to visualize situations that can become handy in new problems, and help with our estimation sense."
"Hello all.  My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, and I am a middle school special education teacher (grades 6-8; ages 11-14) in Carmel, Indiana.  I teach math resource. I am looking forward to learning from all of you so that I may better serve my students.  Thank you!"
This is a great question.  Please provide some help with dealing with the grading (reporting) quandry we are stuck in.  Assessing is a different matter from reporting.
"I have not taught algebra I for a long time.  I knew how to do the problems and explain them, but it was very interesting to see the visual solutions.  I think this would help many students who struggle with algebra."
"A teacher might say \I can explain 'why' you do this but it will just confuse you. (i.e. dividing fractions). Just do it this way (i.e. keep, change, flip). Without explaining why to a student isn't it more confusing?"""
Don't give up too quickly!  It is OK if in the end the answer is not correct.  What is important is that deep thinking took place and the learner was engaged and stuck with the problem.
"This kind of activity is so nonthreatening so that participants can relax into the math of it while at the same time it opens up the realization that there are many perspectives and many ways of thinking about \seeing\"" numbers. Also, the question Cathy asked about how the various ways were the same provided an opportunity for students to think of the individual responses and see differences, similarities and begin, perhaps, to generalize."
- **Arithmetic Approach**
A-B    We have used methods that require right answers and correct procedures.  Foundational skills are missing.  They are not taught to think about Maths but to look for the correct procedure and answer.
"We also group our math students using the RtI process.  Also, if you have a special education label, many teachers don't believe that some of our students have strong math skills."
"I agree many times kids will seek out those adults who will do the work for them.  Those of us who expect the students to buckle down and put for some effort are seen as mean and uncaring.  Math Nights sounds like a wonderful idea, we put so much into pushing reading that I think often time math is forgotten."
I second your questions.
Everything is relative. do not worry.
"In my school, we were focused on grouping students. I had the lowest students. I did not tell them that they were the lowest. I told them that I had personally selected the students in my class. I chose the students that could learn the most that year. At the end of the year, my students showed higher levels of growth than any other class."
"I noticed that the teacher valued each contribution, provided time for table and peer discussions, had student argue his answer by drawing a picture, had students explain what another student did - further validating their response, students are not afraid to say that they don't understand.  The teacher allowed many students to share and discuss their thinking, she allowed much time for discussion and debate, and the teacher provided different ways with pictures and discussion.  A great example of teaching to see!"
"I think these methods open up the broader dialogue that people see can see numbers very differently, and more importantly, that this is okay. Discussions such as these foster an open- minded community of learners, something that can be one of the most exciting parts of using math to solve problems."
We are in this together!
"From a growth mindset point of view we should probably not be looking for students to get \the correct answer\"" but to evolve that from the different ways different children look at the problem."""
Because all the factors above and many other.
"Cathy asked students for answers first and accepted all answers without comment, encouraging students to volunteer even incorrect answers in a very nonjudgemental way.  She allowed one student to explain his thinking so they could all learn from his mistake.  She wrote down exactly what each students said when they gave their method of solving the problem, but she corrected the math terms as she wrote it mathematically correctly.  She asked students to explain each step, so they actually owned their thinking.  She wrapped it all up with picture representations and by talking about which mathematical property was used.  Much more effective than trying to teach the properties with her own examples!"
"I'm interested in containers.  I love the story of \Pandora's Box\"", though it was actually a clay jar. (and wow! what a great myth to discuss ideas of gender stereotypes) None-the-less, I'd like to read a modern version--\""Dora's Box\"" to the kids, then have the kids engage in lengthy discussion and activities around containers. The classroom as safe container, their room, etc.  I have been saving boxes of various sizes. I'd like to have the children/kids/teens choose a container. Paint, decorate, collage their container. Talk about what they'd keep in it, and how much room is in it. How much room IS in the container? and how can we ACTUALLY find out?--each one is different. How much room do emotions of various kinds take up in the container? Is anger biggest? or Love? How much room for various treasures? Some people say \""one person's garbage is another person's treasure\"". What's a treasure to you?  So an art activity becomes a personal exploration, but also an exploration of space and a sharing of values and ideas."""
wow 40! You rock! Each one I review takes at least 10 minutes though. I'm probably a bit slow at giving feedback - or think too much LOL
That is right! it is very hard to handle 50 students in the classroom. My first experienced was in the public school in my country having 55 students and it was really hard to manage compared now at my present job for only 17 students in the classroom. We can monitor well the learning in every student.
"If you can get students to break out of their mold in how they look at things. I can see a conversation like this at first being focused on what the answer *is*, versus the procedural steps. However, upon putting the time and effort into the how and how come students will actually see some of the differences and perhaps internalize those results."
"Students do listen to their teachers, even if it doesn't always appear that way.  A positive message such as telling them you believe in them, especially if they are struggling with an assignment will get them to believe in themselves as well."
"Frustrated and demoralized is absolutely correct!  And so, so, sad..."
"The variety of strategies/methods utilized by teachers, as well as the teachers own ability/fondness for math, along with students not having a strong understanding of the basics are a couple of reasons why students have a difficult time with math.  The variety of programs used in some districts vary from school to school in some districts, which only compounds the problems.  Some students are math phobic because of those things mentioned, and their confidence needs a huge bolster.  They have to be shown that they can do/understand math.  Algebra is/can be a difficult subject for many students, but it is a developmental jump from the other maths leading up to it.  My students, many times, have to be 'taught' that it is different, and there needs to be different thought processes used."
"It's sad, because we have the neurological and developmental knowledge of when children are ready for abstract concepts, yet when it comes to education we totally ignore it. I think you ask an excellent question, but I don't know the answer."
"This really shows how differently each person can see the same \simple\"" pattern and still all get the same sum."
That's a shame. Better luck in the future. Interesting talks.
Inquiry teaching leads to students having good questions.
I've had many students tell me that they did not like math or that they were not good in math.
"Hi everyone!  My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I've taught math exclusively for about 4 years now.  I was one of those that did well in math simply because I knew how to follow the rules.  However, working with students, I realized that didn't mean that I was ready to teach them anything :)  I began learning how to teach math.  The more I learned, the more I wanted to know.  And I find myself asking the question, \Why didn't anyone ever tell me that?  It makes so much sense!\""  I look forward to learning from all of you."""
I think engaging our students in these types of conversations is a vital part of shifting their thinking about math.  I also think that their perceptions are highly related to their success.
Good point!
"I do believe that in younger age to put kids in ability group will set kids to failure. We need to challenge kids, but in high school, what we can do? If kids have poor basic math skill, how can we help them?"
Which important 'teacher moves' do you see Cathy enact in the number talk?
"In the Alternative program where I teach, students are not gouoped according to ability necessarily. There are a lot of factors that determine how students are grouped.  This results in groups of mixed ability and while I certainly think that this does create some challenges I am becoming more convince that the benefits outweigh them."
"Hi! I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>.  I teach math to high school students in Alternative Education programs in Riverside County (Southern California).  I just finished participating in Project Delta, a 3-year grant to improve math instruction in Riverside County.  Through that, I completed 8 courses in UCLA extension, Math Content Program for Teachers (MCPT).  I have been immersed in math content, pedagogy and the common core for 3 years, so this course is kind of like \methadone\"" in a way.  I just can't get enough math!  I want to continue to explore more best practices for teaching math or teaching others to teach math."
"All of these points have to be taught and rehearsed regularly. Many students approach school like everything else: They're all winners, everything is easy, and no one should ever be frustrated. Students with high self-esteems and gifted students are often the most resistant. Students will have to be weaned off the over-abundance of praise and enabling culture to do all of these."
"I felt much the same way as Laurent Schwartz did, that faster was equal to smarter. Maybe it was the generation I grew up in and the culture of the time. I know that students today in many cases feel the same way even now."
I think that there is a fine line between being a teacher/mentor/guide and a buddy/friend/equal in the role of teacher that calling the teacher by a first name might suggest. We are not meant to be equals. That doesn't mean we are any less passionate or invested in our students.
I also wondered... but felt like she probably didn't want to do that on camera...
I believe that parents have a big influence on a student's view of the subject (often negative).
The dot card task allow participants to variety of methods and views of approaching the problem.
Team of people
Let me rewind you is great language in that it validates student thinking and seeks to add clarity to the discussion.
"I have mixed feelings about this as well.  Yes, pairing up higher and lower students can be very beneficial for both parties, but sometimes, the higher level students have negative reactions to this and the lower level students want the teacher's attention instead.  I do like your idea of having these students choose between helping other students and doing more challenging work.  I think that the power of choice will help students feel like they are more a part of the class, too."
I think that elementary students would also find the questions for the 3 x 3 cube engaging as they could work in groups and construct the actual cube with MAB cm blocks. There would be lots of discussion emanating from this problem.
When dividing a fraction the answer doesnt have to be smaller than my original
Agreed...I would like more info on how to create this mindset for children.
1. Other people judge us.
It is a vital teacher/parent role to build every students' self image to where each student believes they can be successful at learning.... especially math.
"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics  - I believe it relates to initiatives in the US to increase interest, achievement, and consequently the talent pool in these areas."

"As Jo stated the reasons for low achievement among tracked students, I couldn_t help but recall my experiences in tracked classes where all of these things happened.  Students who were clearly far above the others in terms of their understanding were not challenged at all because the class was taught to the middle and low-achieving students in the class.  The teacher had low expectations of students and often reminded me that we were constrained in what we could teach because they were þthe low kids._  Students clearly picked up on this and began to have low expectations for themselves as well, not turning in work or completing assignments that they viewed as busywork (because they were!!)."
"Just wondering...do you have a bright little darling?  I am thinking back to when I attended my son's \Back to School\"" night and the teacher told me that my son and one of his friends already knew ALL that she was teaching this year in math class.  Later, when I visited his class, I saw the class laying on the floor using popscicle sticks to add two digit numbers.  My son and his friend Greg were making buildings out of the popscicle sticks.  Yes, much was being done to address this behind the scenes and months later a pull-out program was started in the district to address the needs of the few kids in this situation, but please consider how this can play out!  This is a very complex issue."""
"It's interesting to see how people come up with different ways to do the same problem. Students will be able to see that even if they didn't think the exact same way their partner did, it doesn't mean that their way is wrong. They can understand that their way works too. This can be very empowering."
"At the beginning of the unit, say fractions, have students write down three occasions when they have had to use fractions in their every day life.  If they cannot think of three, then they can write about when they have seen other people use the concept."

"Yes, it's important to realize that there is more than one RIGHT way!"
"Just today, the math specialist at our school asked me how she could best assist me in the classroom and she said that last years Fifth Grade teacher used her for remediation. So now I'm really wondering if truly ALL students should be kept together, and it sounds to me like Jo is saying they should, then I'd really like to try that and think of another way to use the math specialist to assist me and my students."
"Oh, yes.  Let us not forget the brain research shared with us how stress and anxiety block the working memory!"
"I am going to use a rhythm and movement activity to coincide with \count bys\"".  This will engage students who need to move, who struggle with memorization, and in general are kinesthetic learners.  This activity can be done as a whole group a couple of times/week."""
kids can gain the perspective of seeing right up and close various ways that different kids perceive the same information. It allows them to ponder and reflect upon how they saw that information and perhaps see a better way to tackle the problem.
Keep students working/doing things.

The Holy Grail of Learning?
"Having to teach multiple disciplines may lend a hand in being perceived as not being \huge mathematics fans\"". Primary teachers are required to be jacks of all trades, master of none, so to speak. I feel I fall into this all adage, and hope to improve my skills as a \""math teacher\"", so that I do not impart any negative messages about math to my first graders."""
- 
One group of students I really worry about is the students achieving the lowest grades in the 'top' Maths group. These students often leave school believing they are no good at Maths because of their relative 'failure' and they rarely seem to pursue careers in Maths.
That's true...we have big responsibility and have to motivate our kids to question themselves and develop intuition and curiosity
I agree--students know when we are telling them things to make them feel better.  We now have an outside source we can provide.
Also focusing on stereotypical tasks for women such as decorating and baking may not be the best idea.
"All ideas are welcome in this class. To become better math thinkers, we need to allow ourselves to make mistakes. That's where learning happens!"

"Really nice activity. It may look as a simple activity, but became a very rich one, promoting discussion, multiple representations of solving problems. It is a Must-do activity in my clasroom."
I figured out the partner and then I had to use and excel spreadsheet formula to figure it out.
You can get better at math if you persist and work on it!
I am a little disturbed that the students who were trying to make sense of the question 1/ 2/3 did not discuss what this means! The focus was on how to solve the question. If the students are suppose to make sense of the question I think they should first figure out what the question is actually asking. This is how I figured it out since I could not remember the algorithm.
I guess so.  I was just using Sebastian's words.
There is nothing you haven't done.  The Progress page is broken.  The tech support team has asked us to ignore it for now.
"Like others have noted, this discussion shows that there are multiple approaches to a simple math problem.  Further it show the relationship between math and creativity.  I think it also shows that math is important everyday thinking and it adds relevance to math."
"The number of columns increase by two with each case. The middle column is doubled so that there are two new columns of the same height, with a new middle column being created. It  increases by one cube over the two columns on either side."
"I would tell my students that we are learning together and that as much as they are learning new material I am learning how to present the material, I am also learning the material because an important part of math is learning multiple approaches to the same problem and figuring out which one is the best for you in a given situation."

"I am absolutely certain that it creates a fixed mindset. In my first district in the 80s, I came into a small school that had 5 classes of students at each grade level (5th to 8th) and 5 different lanes to place students (6.1 to 6.5). I pushed them to eliminate all lanes and they were willing to risk removing lanes through 7th and having two in 8th grade. The number of students taking college bound mathematics in high school doubled."
"have no idea if this is of value, but came across it today on Education Dive:"
"Like many of you, I was struck by the students' sense of freedom in math.  They communicated such enthusiasm, creativity, and interest in basic arithmetic which conflicts with my experience of learning to multiply as a 3rd grader with timed tests and memorizing facts.  What a powerful video! I will share this with my colleague when we are planning for our intervention groups this school year."
Thank you <redacted> for helping me see how to make this equation into a expression. Thank God for discussion groups.
I will give the students information about Mindsets and brain research.  I will also make a poster of my quote.
"The students in this class likely said that \math is fun\"". We get to work on problems with our friends and use the iPads. They would say that the teacher is fun and funny and that they like sharing the way they see the problems with the rest of the kids in the class. "
"In year 7, I remember being grouped into the 'smart class', which was a grouping based on your teacher's perceptions of overall performance in primary school. I have no idea, really, how they came about this but I do remember feeling that I was expected to be good at everything because of the perceptions of the different teachers about the 'top' class. Some subjects, like maths, clicked, but others... "
One would be from the parents themselves...
"Curious as to how to develop growth mindset tasks for early elementary students who are learning basic arithmetic (four basic operations - addition, subtraction, mult, division).  Are students of this age developmentally / cognitively capable of approaching open ended problems? I realize there will be a developmental wide spectrum among different students, but I'm curious as to whether this approach should be used and how to implement it."
"Yes, you have a very important point, \the popular culture icons\"", Barbie is a major example but do not forget the pop or rock singer stars, they become of models to our kids."""
"As a classroom teacher, I must find a way to nurture the math knowledge students do have in order to build their confidence, forgetting about stereotypes and acknowledging accomplishments for each individual student."
In the beginning of the year students seem to be more curious. As they become more comfortable with their environment their curiosity becomes more apart of classroom discussions.
I agree that seeing the variety of thinking really does point out how teaching one procedure can never reach all thinkers.
"Students get these negative ideas from classmates, teachers, media , and parents. The person who plays sports, or entertains is rewarded, while the student who is very good with math and science is seen as the kid who does not always fit in. Students need to see more positive role models who are making a difference with math and science."

"What can we do about the Curiculum? When you have so much stuff to run after? I agree with everything, about teaching the most important, and that teaching evrything doesnt mean you learn everything. But what you say to parents too if they see you dont do everything that is supposed. And in Greece they do another stupid thing from this year.At the final exams at the end of the year, in high school the 50% of the tests are from a \ bank of exam tests\"". That kills any disposal for inquiry and turns high school to a training center, and of course students and parents pay the cost, the 1st loosing any interest for learning and the 2nd their money to preper their kids for the final exams."""
I think girls get this perception from other girls.
"I think there may be some sound and profound thought here. The rehearsal with correct, though shallow learning, then becomes integrated (reinforced) and thereby a new platform from which to build new (and ever more complex) learning."

"I wonder too about the kids who don't have a foundation in Math yet, who didn't raise their hands, who don't have many friendly numbers, and who don't understand what the other kids were talking about in their explanations."
"I would love to keep my eye on a blog, especially about favorite tasks for geometry and algebra.  I'm just starting to use inquiry in my high school geometry class.  Today was the first day of classes.  Even the most reluctant students were busy with making the string polyhedra one of your videos showed.  I'll go on with some of my classes to angles, using the Geometry labs from Piccioto (sorry for the spelling...no resources at hand) and to perimeter and area through another of the resources from Day 2 or 3.  I learn a LOT from seeing examples, so the more I can see the better.   I guess I also would like some ideas, if anyone has any, as to what topics to emphasize in high school geometry...I will be looking at tasks to try to organize what ones to use before others.  The types of thinking can used from various tasks to make a logical progression of ideas that feed into one another, so I'll be looking a lot at that.  Any feedback would be appreciated.  Also, feedback about task references would be appreciated.  It looks like the on-line collections are pretty complete."
"As teachers pull students aside to help them through a math assignment, the students, who need further help day after day begin to label themselves as \bad at math.\""  "
I work in a small GED program with students at a variety of levels -- and definitely understand the issue that you describe.  One thing that I do is to have everyone -- regardless of level -- share in solving one geometry or algebra problem a session -- I usually use numbers that can be calculated easier -- and strive to use common household problems but I do want to provide students with the experience of solving problems in a group - -and realizing that they can do geometry and algebra.
I also agree with you and thought it meant to be written as common core.

"Looking at more than just numbers in a different way really drives home that you can think about all math differently.  This is a safe way to involve people in discussion- it's about shapes, not calculations.  But listening to how others saw the \grouping\"" of them to get 10 is powerful!"""

Now when I am confronted with a new task I haven't seen, under circumstances that I have never encountered. I simply see it as just one more bolt after another. When enough are turned in the proper sequence under the proper conditions the task is complete."
Great advice.
...which is why investigation and discovery are so important. We MUST give our students an opportunity to discover their own way in mathematics. The rote learning of methods and procedures has to be avoided and students be given a chance to develop whatever method they find works for them. Fine tuning these methods in order to make them efficient comes later when they are mature enough to realise that there may be a better way. And even then this may not be necessary. I really don't care how someone arrives at the correct answer to 11 x 12 as long as their method delivers the right answer. How did you work this out? How many other ways are there? Does it matter which you use? (let's assume speed doesn't matter... See session 3!)

"Number Talks are important to do because it gives people a visual representation of the same answer with a variety of ways to achieve it.  This allows people to see the multiple ways of solving the same problem, in addition to hearing the justification each person had in solving it their way.  Patterns are revealed that a person may not have considered."

Further gains can be made, but it will consist of me taking courses like this one, improving my questioning techniques, and finding questions that will inspire good math thinking."

What currently grabs my interest are the posts regarding roles kids take in groups - be it ability grouping or mixed ability.  How can we ensure all kids get a chance to participate and be a leader?  I work as a substitute teacher and have - in the same district - for three years now.  I go into many classrooms and all have some degree of grouping/tracking.  Math is usually grouped by whole classes - with several classes being offered.  I see far more ability grouping in reading.  I dread stepping into these groups because they are lifeless and repetitive and do not offer any authentic learning.
What can be gained from the dot card number talk:  Students recognize that there are many different approaches to solving the same problem; that they have unique personal problem-solving abilities that are valid; students can learn other strategies to approach the same problem that may help them in the future

That is great.  I also let the students know that we all make mistakes.  The key is figuring them out.
"This dot card exercise shows there are so many ways to think about a math problem. As a classmate previously commented, I like how no preference is given to any particular method. All methods are seen as valuable and the diversity of thought is seen as very positive. This lesson can be applied to more complex math problems and is very helpful."

"I agree when the one student said math was \free\"".  I also was taken aback how comfortable they were during discussions and how they viewed others pointing out their mistakes as helping them.  It's a totally new perspective."""
I also am a Title I teacher and am taking this class for the same reasons that you and Jeri are.
"I have a very hard time learning everyone's names.  I start the year telling this to students, I have a little activity I do and then for 2 weeks I greet students at the door coming in and leaving and I have to say their name.  I apologize if wrong but send the message that I will get it, that I want to know their name but this is something I have to work very hard at."
Very cool poster
Provide ample discussion and encouragement to determine how my students are learning in my classroom
"Thank you, this is a very good idea."
You nailed it! This is exactly what I was thinking.
"I liked the example one student gave about 300 apples and saw this as something not real.  Many of students in the past would start reading a math story and stop after a few sentences, and comment. \Why would she do that?\""  Because of the disconnect, they had difficulties moving through the problem itself."""
great visual!!
"I've loved reading all the posts in the forum, and thank you everyone!  I just finished the class, and let me say -- Jo, when is the next class?  Sign me up!"
I also really like how the students felt it was ok to make mistakes.  Kids need to know this is part of the process.
"As most teachers, I have heard a myriad of responses from students in regards to their feelings towards math that are very similar to those students interviewed. At times high achieving students who are not challenged appropriately may say that they are bored. For the most part though the negative responses are from students who do not perform well in math. Response such as it is too hard, I am bad at math, I will never be good at this, both my parents were bad at math, I never get anything right, I feel stupid are a few examples I have heard from students. I am interested in the feedback that students are receiving from their teachers if if these students are ever told what  aspects that are doing well at."
"-...\an opportunity to learn.\"""""

"Yes, you are right, should be: Diagonals + sides.  But, I think the idea holds.  "
Thanks for posting the link.
When did mathematics take this kind of a turn? How long have we been off course?
"Excellent question, let me answer with a question-if it is actually meaningful to students this year will it hold the same meaning for all following students? ;)"
"When giving feedback on the design you own tasks activity I find that I constantly think: \it is a nice activity, but it will cost too much time.\"" So I found how much I am occupied with the time limit I used to feel when teaching economics. The learning goals were huge, the progress was slow and there was always too little time. I think a mind shift is needed here, but I notice I am afraid, yes AFRAID, to let go of my 'too little time mindset'. Does somebody recognize this? Did somebody cope with this and how did you do that?"""
"Students hear negative messages from peers, siblings, and parents who comment on their own experiences in learning math."
I agree. To trust and belong goes beyond the classroom.
"Fibonacci in the nautilus' shell, for example."
thanks for that link!
Only sometimes
"I think many elementary teachers become teachers because they love reading and literature.  I think if they loved math, they would have become secondary math teachers or engineers.  So, take the institutional draw of theses teachers to k-5 and you get perhaps a concentration of teachers who don't understand math very well and have them at the foundation of our education system.  Also, the fact that most parents have been taught within this system and will more than likely have had negative experiences with math will cause negative bias towards math that will be passed on to their children.  Innumerable sources of negative messages!"
"I was surprised (and excited) to hear these students using academic vocabulary and also their conceptual understanding of decomposing numbers.  Also, their great attitudes towards math."
"When we consider real life examples, we think in terms of sciences: Physics, Chemistry, Biology.. So math is just the tool to understand other disciplines. When Sebastian says time is geometry, I share him his point of view but as soon we start considering time and distances then speeds .. this is Physics and not Math."
Thanks for the link!
A very good point! It_s hard to say it out loud though!
"I also don't want negative comments about a new student. Every day should start on a positive note, especially the new year. In kindergarten the students usually come in pretty positive and I want it to stay that way. If you think you can, you will."
"I am trying to complete my final chunk of peer assessment (question 6.6) and, in the 'learning to grade' section I can give 0 or 1 as usual but am unable to type anything in the written feedback box for some reason. Please help!!"
Students need to hear that mistakes are part of learning and that they are not being judged.
"I second both of these thoughts!  I want to see them, as well."
"I haven't called it that but that's my style, too.  I have them do the explaining and writing.  If they loose the way, I ask questions to get them back on track."
"I believe that the negativity about math comes from parents and their perception of math. If a parent struggled with math they very often say to their child that math is hard or was hard for them. Unfortunately society has perpetuated this as well. If a child can't read, society is appalled but if a child isn't doing well in math, well, everyone believes its because math is too hard. Isn't reading hard at some point? Why is it OK for children to do poorly in math? Is this belief the same in China or other top performing countries?"
mistakes are great.  they make your brain  grow when you inspect them.
So sad that this happened in Kindergarten when the little ones are so eager and enthusiastic.
My thoughts too!

"I was struck by the scientist who introduced Jo in Session 1, Part 3 when she said, \People who could do math were clever.  If you couldn't do math, you weren't clever.\"" As we know, the second statement does not logically follow from the first."""
All good now - did mine last night.
I don't students in middle and high school could describe breaking down and de-com-po-sing problems the way that one kid did.
"Ditto, UGH!"
I just really wish I could swipe it so that my students could follow this format in the math class in the fall :)
Just let me do it.
Me too!! This way beyond what I see in first grade!!
I like the idea of a discussion about mistakes.  Thanks!
Number sense lies at the foundation of mathematical thinking. Without number sense there would be scant progress in mathematics
"I want my students to know that I expect them to make mistakes. I don't believe in anyone being perfect because there is no such thing. If we don't make mistakes, how are we supposed to learn?"
I think A and B lead to higher-level math being difficult for many.
"If we aren't making mistakes, we aren't learning. If we only do what we are comfortable with and what we already know, how will we ever learn more? Take risks - make mistakes - you'll learn more because of them."
"I agree with the 5 results Jo gave in this video. As a teacher it is really difficult to treat all students the same when they are coming to you for group work according to their ability. I've found that students want to be working on the same things as their friends who might be in a different group. They try to figure out whose work is \harder\"". Also, we tend to keep students in groups based on how many students are in the group - ie: groups of 5 - rather than moving students around to have a group of 7, a group of 3, etc."""
"I agree too, Ken Robinson's talks are inspirational, Jo"
"Willingness to work together, to share ideas, and to ask questions without embarrassment seem to be key to an effective group.  I generally take 4 or 5 days at the beginning of the year with various group activities that exhibit one of the skills of effective group work.  After the task we talk about what worked, what didn't, and why.  For example, one task is to take a 100 piece puzzle and give each student 25 pieces.  The students must put the puzzle together, but cannot touch another students pieces.  The purpose of this exercise is to have others do the work, but to help by explaining where the piece might go.  While the group work at the beginning of the year helps, I think students need to learn how to work in a group from kindergarten on."
This is good - I have used this graphic organizer several times in my classroom.
The Common Core provides for tracking starting in 7th grade math classes. 
"I remember doing dot card number talks in my master's classes. I found them to be a very concrete way to get students to understand number properties and properties of operations. As students explained how they saw the configuration of dots on the card, and the subsequent discussion of how the strategies were similar, student begin to see how flexible and creative mathematics can be. They can use what they know about decomposing and recomposing numbers to solve more complex problems."
"I see that error, thanks for reporting.  We'll debug that straight away."
It shows students there is no fixed algorithm or method regarding how numbers should be added
I do plan to discuss the current brain research with the students to generate a discussion that will hopefully set a positive tone for making mistakes in the class.
"I was surprised that they used the math language in their answers.  I was also surprised to see that they didn't mind making mistakes.  It seemed like a very communal approach to math and they liked that about it.  I liked to hear the word \free\"" to describe math."""
"Given the right opportunities, all brains can grow and learn math."
"It would be nice to have a summary of video lengths and overall video length totals for each session. It's always a surprise to click on a new video and see how long this one is going to be and decide if I have the 12 minutes to take a look, then process the info and answer the related question, or if it's just a 36 second quickie."
"The purpose of timed tests is to make the math facts so familiar that the student does not have to think about it. Therefore more time and energy can be spent on solving the problem. Also, accuracy is less of a problem. The final answer is not wrong because of a miscalculation. That is my understanding as to why there are timed tests."
"Regardless of the groupings of numbers, the outcome was the same. There may not be one right way to \look\"" at a problem. This \""ah, ha\"" can be a confirmation for students at all levels of achievement."""
Wow!!
"I don't think directing these parents anywhere will do any good. It is kind of like changing your husband....It can't be done, but you can raise your son to be a different kind of husband."
Hi Brian. I have a daughter who was diagnosed with dyslexia. It is great to see you pursuing avenues to facilitate your learning.
ha ha ha!! i love it also!!
I agree with all the above Jo. Thank you.
"I would begin by saying, \Everyone can succeed; each mistake we make teaches us something; and if you persist at the answer, you can unlock another world."""
"I think these students would say MATHS is fun, and manipulative.  Math is finding patterns and relationships. Math is working with friends and using Ipads and Smart boards to show a variety of thinking."
or... don't send that kind of work home.  keep it where you can have control of it.  :)
Yes!
"I have already purchased several of the items on the Reference list for this class and am thrilled with the information.  Along the lines of the responses about number talks and inquiry-based learning, I would also love to have actual examples I could use in my Algebra courses that are project-based and REAL, real world examples, not the ones that say they are real world and are still about Jane being 5 years older than her sister....  "
I was surprised at the level of mathematical vocabulary the students used correctly (such as decomposing). It was also great to see the positive attitudes about math.
"Another place kids can get poor messages about math: definitely family members.  Also, sometimes pointing out gifted issues highlights that a student is only gifted in one particular area.  Or tests of multiple intelligence, lock someone in or out of logic/math thinking."
Way to show that councilor!!
"\The fact of being quick or slow isn't really relevant\"""""
I think it is great to hear these boys saying that they feel okay when they make a mistake.  They also feel confident that they will be able to use friendly numbers and decomposing and multiplying to solve harder problems in grade 4. (LOL!)  Their confidence in math especially was great.
"I think it's interesting to hear the different ways that others see things, yet come up with the same answer."
- You have to be a brown noser to be good at Math 
I think families give students a negative message (my parents even comment on how they don't know how I do it with all of my students so 'bad' at math).  The state does it when they show that the math cut scores are much lower than that of other subjects.  I've also seen elementary teachers do the same thing.  I've had a few that admit that they 'skip over' math because they don't like math so they don't want to spend time on it in their class.
"Mistakes are welcome in our class.  In fact, I want you to make mistakes because it shows that you are learning.  My expectation is that you come to class each day ready to tackle a challenge and watch your math mind grow."
I have downloaded some of the videos from this class to show my fifth graders that it really is a good thing to make mistakes. I want them to know that they will learn a lot more from their mistakes than from getting the right answers. I am going to expect mistakes!
I think that students get negative images about math from their parents.
"I didn't mind math until Algebra, which I found quite difficult. I think I had my hand up through most the class. The teacher became frustrated with me and gave the message that if I could just somehow get a 'C' that would be good enough, and that I probably wouldn't need math anyway. As a teenager that wasn't all that interested in homework- that settled it. I officially could not 'do' math."
"I completely agree. I had the same experience. People would ask me, \Are you an English mind or a math mind?\"""""
"It's clear -- and/but she also makes sure that they are learning that the math principles hold up, too."
It didn't surprise me about their answers because you could they were really engaged during the math talk. It was very fun to hear them realize how much they like math.
"At the beginning of the new teaching year, I want to teach my students about how mistakes help the brain grow and encourage the students to be ok with making mistakes....pointing out that making mistakes on the board doesn't mean that I'm not good at mathematics."
Using these cards can help build number sense and help students begin to see patterns.  It also helps students begin to develop different ways to group numbers
"If you eat the same food everyday, how does your body and brain grow?"
"What surprised me was how enthusiastic they were about math and how they thought of math as something which was \free\"".  They also were not afraid to make mistakes in front of the class, because, as they said, \""Everyone makes mistakes,\"" and because their classmates will help them understand the problem in the course of the discussion.  I was also surprised they knew the term \""decompose\"", versus, say, \""breaking down a number\""."""
I think this goes to support that the more ways we can find to stimulate the brain with different approaches (than just the traditional quick answer format) the better.
interesting
Dot card number talks give people the opportunity to experience how many different ways different people can approach a problem.  They help people to think flexibly about problem solving and to focus on the process rather than the solution.
"I also like that they used the word free to mean different things.  They said it was free as in it doesn't cost money to do, free as in you can do it whenever and wherever you want, and free as in not done in one set way."
"I don't think a \maths club\"" will lead to fixed mindset. Specially if teachers provide these students rich tasks, open problems which are not linked with the curriculum. It could be a great opportunity to learn about maths history, maths in real life, ..."""
Kindergarten tasks.
"Ah, not about being smart but about getting better.  I may post that on on the wall of my class. Thank you!"
Useful idea. I will also apply in the beginning of the school year.
"My thought is that is the answer A the teaching methods, because that leads to answer B, but I don't think of it a lack of knowlegde, I think of it as a lack or reasoning skills and understanding of mathematics"
I believe the dot number card/talks are important because they help students see the conceptual side of mathematics. The simple problem of 5 + 5 is no longer so simple or so easy. Students are also exposed to the variety of logic or thinking styles that other students engage to solve problems.
I was told that I was special since I was good at math.  I think this hurt my relationships with my siblings and peers who struggled.  It also made it difficult for me when I encountered higher levels of math where I did struggle.
"I can echo the standard stereotypes, that girls typically have lower aptitude in math than boys, as well as the stereotype that Asians have high aptitude while African Americans and Latin@s have low aptitude. I think also that students in special education are thought to have low math aptitude."
The first half of the article is pretty interesting.  Thanks for the link.
Loved that they felt that math was free.  That they were free to solve problems in anyway they liked.  They liked the math talks because of the sharing of ways and helping with mistakes.
"I work at a high school that is full inclusion, that is students with disabilities or IEPs are in the classes with all other students. What I have seen is that students who normally wouldn't deem themselves successful rise to the occasion to be there an outperform their peers. I wonder how we can give this feeling to all students, not just the ones who feel like they need to prove themselves."
I would agree with this point of view that you assume they have the number sense.  Unfortunately I find that a lot of students don't and it seems pointless to continue ahead if they don't have this number sense- so we probably need to incorporate more activities in the classroom so they can hopefully gain some further insight into manipulating and understanding numbers.
I liked hearing how they enjoyed the way they were able to solve the math problems differently.
"I like the term 'friendly' number, but also had not heard of it until these videos.  In the past I had asked students how they could make the problem 'easier', but I think I prefer friendly and may adopt that in the future."
Fantastic. This is going on my wall this year!!
"I was hoping that this course was going to synthesise and 'bring together' the work of Jo, Carol Dweck and Daniel Willingham ('Why Don't Students Like School', a cognitive scientist's perspective), all of whom have had a big impact upon me over the last 3 years. The latter's work, to me, does not overwhelmingly support Jo's position."
I agree. They don't see the importance of learning difficult problems that require critical thinking because state assessments are multiple choice. They don't see the math that many jobs require for various careers until they realize it's too late and feel they wished they had paid more attention and had more care about math in grade school.  Too many grow up living in the current moment and don't look toward their future.
"High stakes testing contributes to low tolerance for mistakes. The emphasis is not on the process of learning, but the results of assessments."
"think number talks are important to show students that there are many different ways to do a problem, but they all have similarities. I think this sets up the discussion about algebra and how to think about algebra conceptually."
"I like it. the green leaves--examples of interesting mistakes--provide the fuel for the tree to grow.  Maybe it could be a flowering tree too, with the flowers being examples of big ideas covered (and mastered) through the year."
Will need to learn more about this concept--sounds like an excellent way to create they type of math class we want!
"Students feel pressure from teachers, parents, and society to get good grades"
Kiddos need to hear they can do math and enjoy it
I was surprised by the academic language and vocab these 3rd graders used.  Decompose:)
She absolutely did that and she acknowledged each response by writing their names on the white board.
"I liked a lot the idea of \math is free\"", you can use it everyday and anywhere."
"I wold have to say that while some of my students are often curious, the studnets who typically struggle in math class rarely seem curious."
Sherri- Watch the video about. At the end of the video she asked a question with four choices. Hope this help :-)
"I believe students lack a foundational knowledge because of the teaching methods at schools/colleges. If a math concept is too difficult, it is bypassed so the class can move on, instead of clarify/reinforcing the math concept."
"One place students get the idea that they are not good at math, and may never be comes from the end of year tests that we give them.  The level of expectation is for students heading to college.  There are others that do some great things with math, but don't plan on going to college, at least not in a field where a quadratic equation will be used."
Hi to all!  I love taking classes and gaining knowledge!  I am seeking new ways to help my 10th grader (this Fall) overcome her fear of math as well as master it.
"I think, first of all, the students would open their mind to new possibilities to solve the same problem. Listen to the arguments of others and learn that things can be resolved in many different ways."
"I feel that dot cards provide a beneficial forum for students to see how others are thinking, and to consider metacognitively how they are themselves going through a problem. For students developing their maths understanding, I feel that being provided an open, encouraging forum that allows for more than one way to solve a problem allows them to determine what works best for them, what makes \sense.\"" Furthermore, I feel that this will be a challenge for students who have developed some number sense to begin to think abstractly and curiously about how others might solve the equation, allowing them to explore the numbers further (one could pose the question, what are three ways to solve this problem.) This also provides the teacher excellent insight into how her students are progressing, and how they are cognitively working through solutions. In all, e dot card exercise provides a forum in which each member of the class can benefit greatly, and have their thoughts discussed positively."""
ah yes... square roots.....
"I love the way it's not about following rules, it's free - I wish I had started like that so it was my comfort zone and not the rule following..."
"I have often heard references to poor math abilities on the radio.  I know parents and peers share these messages too.  Sadly, we as a society seem to accept this attitude with little thought of the consequences."
"At our high school, we have started a year-round Algebra I class that is geared toward students who need a slower paced Algebra I.  Other students take a semester long Algebra I.  Students taking the semester long are predicted by our state to make proficient or higher on the end-of-course exam.  It is my understanding that the prediction is based on previous years' scores.  "
I agree with your dual mindset. I almost wonder how it work not to have groups based on ability? Students can tell who is getting something in class ans who isn't. Self confidence plays such a vital role in math class. It seems like a catch 22. I would like to see how these mixed groups work.
"At my school we send \Good News\"" cards, which are small note cards to tell parents/students anything positive."""
I am glad that I am taking this course but I was not aware after  having done so much work  (currently at lesson 5) that I have to post something to every video.
"Open mind set (persistence and hard work are essential to success) and mistakes promote brain growth, so get out there and make mistakes!"
"This has been a very interesting topic for me to grapple with. We have made many changes in our school to allow for time with small groups and now I am starting to really go deeper in my thinking and my understanding.  I am not sure at this point how to move forward.  I see so many benefits to both sides.  I understand the research given, but I also understand needing time to make up deficits with specific students during small group intervention time."
"Hello, My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I am a special Education Teacher in Virginia. I am excited about to get started with this class. I will be teaching second grade math this year and I am hoping to get some strategies to keep my students engaged and excited about math."
"I love how they said math was free!  I guess I never thought of it that way, but they are pretty correct!"
ok!
"The statement, \Thinking about other things to make one thing work.\"" seemed very insightful for this age level.  "
"I believe that further from the TV at school, with friends in the House, Internet, social networks on the radio and in the movies, among others."
I think the visual and the verbal descriptions are really interesting for people to explore number pattern and different ways of seeing the same pattern
"Once my daughter was having trouble learning how to \borrow\"" in subtraction.  (Second grade, I think).  She couldn't understand why, when the need to borrow took the number to zero, and you still needed more, you needed to go into the next column and borrow.  \""Why can't you just put it up there as -1?\"" she asked?  A big hurdle to understanding borrowing procedures.  But, fabulous in understanding the real number line in second grade.  I was floored.  It was something I'd never thought of and told her it WOULD work, and then we figured out just how difficult it was, and why borrowing from the next column was easier.  She was so proud that she understood the concept of borrowing and did the best in the class on that subject.  But the teacher never knew of her achievement."""
There is a lot of research into the advantages of games for learning and for implementing gamification in the classroom. More than making an analogy with gaming (which is a great idea in itself) it would be worth researching if the concept in question can be turned into a game. Maybe have a look at MangaHigh or see this FB group: [Games and Learning][1]
"Hi, I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and teach math and science in a middle school in Italy. I hope to improve my experience as a teacher attending this course. See you."
These comments are true and sad at the same time.  Thanks for sharing!
"Yes, exciting way to learn!"
I think more than emotion is a passion for what you do
"Yes, please! Thank you."
"I think it's important for people to see that there are often times multiple ways to solve a problem. Even though we are aware of this and we often times look at a problem in a more than one way, when we see/hear others explain how they perceived and solved the same problem it expands our understanding of mathematics."
So maybe these reasons are interlinked.
"Listening to the variety of approaches models flexible thinking. Students see that there are a variety of ways to approach a problem, to see it through a variety of lens. This may encourage more flexible thinking prior to and while solving a problem."
"As sshumway noted, we aren't teaching every problem, we are using one problem to develop an understandable strategy that will work in multiple problems.  The fact that these kids couldn't explain and do a \fifth grade\"" problem in middle school should alarm us that what we are doing now isn't working for a lot of students.  I too have used the \""time argument\"", but my thinking is slowly changing."""
this would be a great way for my kids to part company with their calculators.  They seem to be so reliant on them that they disregard mental methods and immediately reach to grab the calculator.  This might help build their number confidence
What is the product of 3x6? 
I thought that you may find this interesting and maybe you can use it for teaching multiplication: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwaAAEYIW_8 The question could be why it works? Enjoy! ;)
Cathy engages the class with questions. She asked for various ways to solve the equation.  Through each process she checks in with the presenter to properly annotate their thinking. She even asks the reasoning behind their strategy.  She uses different representations and algebraic equations.
"Loved the visual approach as well, have the sequence used by the students drawn allows them to visualize what others' paths were."
"That sounds a bit like quite a few people I know. If they think they aren't going to get a perfect score they either quit, start again (if possible), or stop trying. For some kids I really think it would help if, when they got an answer wrong, they were always given the opportunity to go back and try again. For some people, it is very important to them to have things completed to a certain standard (100%). Currently, however, most schools don't work like that - afterall we can't have all the kids getting 100% can we? (I have no idea why, but apparently we need to rank the kids rather than educate the kids)"
"Don't fret about making mistakes in math; that's when your brain grows and new knowledge is gained. Free yourself from the fear of failure and welcome new problems and challenges that will lead to many mistakes, but also to great insight and mental growth. Don't worry about being slow because learning math well takes time and persistent effort. Developing the habit of persistence is a key to success throughout life, so use math challenges to help you develop that most valuable of habits. Always remember, in learning situations and in creative challenges, mistakes are your friends! Don't be afraid of making them."
"I think people can appreciate how many different viewpoints can be gained if we learn points of views from others about the same subject and ultimately figure out which is the most efficient method to solve a problem, or at least to appreciate how creative people can be and turn something plain into an interesting subject."
"I want my students to take this phrase literally this year. We can learn from our mistakes, in fact, our brain GROWS from our mistakes.  I want to cultivate an atmosphere that praises mistakes and shows them off so we can all learn from them.  We will in turn also become better communicators and team players when we embrace that mistakes are good and help us learn the most."
"Teachers always tell students to act sensible, but hardly ever ask if the answer makes sense."
"I see two extremes - those that definitely show that they are devasted and those who act like it is funny (probably as a defense mechanism). I have heard parents joke that they are terrible at math, sometimes in groups of parents who all echo the comment.  It  is like some \I am terrible at math club.\""  The weird thing is that people are not so open about being illiterate.  There is a shame in not being able to read because it is seen as something that everyone should be able to do.  "
Thanks for the video. I will be using it.
Love this idea!!!
That sounds great that in the resource room students are allowed to work independently and set high expectations to achieve the task regardless of the strategies they use to get there.

"I started the year out by talking about the brain, hippocampus, and how they can make it grow. I also put the message out there that mistakes are a part of the learning process and we are going to \learn\"" a lot this year!"""
"Yes!  Because there are so many ways to gt to the answer, it invites students to open up to a variety of approaches in a geometry problem as we.. Do it!!"
I think much of the negativity in the west comes from parents and popular culture icons (i.e. Barbie).  Unfortunately some of it also comes from elementary school teachers who are either ill-prepared to teach math due to their own deficiencies and/or don't like it.  They often pass math anxiety on to their students.
"I can't imagine any of my students, past or present, would describe math as \free. You can do whatever you want.\""  Even though we talk about different ways to solve problems, my students don't have this freewheeling, playful attitude towards working with numbers, or the knowledge that math is a creative endeavor.  That will be my new goal this year, to foster that kind of artful approach to math work."""
"I would like to collect my responses too. I know I did some lesson planning along the way, but I'm not sure I'm remembering where all of it was!"
Hi 
"I wonder the same thing.  In other countries, the biggest influence is:  all students are required to excel.  Everyone treats teachers with respect.  Students must complete their homework correctly and follow teacher guidelines without question or suffer consequences for doing so.  And no one is playing video games or playing outside until they have done their work.  I think when our country lost sight of \we\"" - (a country that works together, stays together)... and started in the 60's with \""I\""... More and more Americans, at least, spend more energy finding ways to \""do the minimum\"", \""get away with\"" something, or simply get compensated for no reason...  when, if they used that brain power and possibly even less time, they could ace their classes and discover an enormous wealth of knowledge ..."
"I think it is important to use the Dot Card Number Talks because although it appears to be a simple problem, it shows that people see things and think about things differently.  I would have never thought these to be so powerful."
Hi.
"I agree with you about the importance of being informed parents. Have you studied Carol Dweck's work? Her books and \Brainology\"" program for kids are paradigm-shifters, really helpful."""
"Thanks, Techies!"
I like this and posted something similar with division.  I like to see how my students respond to this challenge.
I would choose B and A.  I think the students think they are not smart enough to do the math.  This belief then becomes an identity about their success in school.  It leads them to drop out because they are not confident students.
"I found the research presented  to be very interesting.  Of the 5 things presented, 4 of them were ones that have been a topic of conversation every year during our articulation process, in which we level students.  Probably the one in which has not been really discussed (may be the most important one) is \The Messages they give.\""  Before this video, my answer to the previous question was the middle group teaching and the work that is given, so it was validation that my answers and thoughts were included in the list.  I always like to error on the side of caution with the borderline causalities and give them a chance to be successful in the higher grouping."""
"It has been my experience that parents want grouping and they want their children to be in the \top group.\"""""
"Hello everyone,"
I agree.
"I had my students come in at the beginning of the year and make a tower. They had to plan the tower using only the tools in the bag and it had to be freestanding. We then discussed how well their first plan worked. No one was successful the first time. We then discussed that it was ok that their first plan did not work. It is ok to make mistakes. I asked them what they did when their first plan did not work, they said they tried something else. They kept trying different plans. Finally their tower stood. I told them that is how this year was going to be, you will try something, we will make mistake but we will persevere together!"
"Just by showing the learners in your class the video or some extrac about the synaps, you are motivating them with proven research, i was so motivated myself."
"I enjoyed how Cathy consistently kept asking for others to contribute. She gave her grade time to explore different answers, and more importantly to discuss those answers by showing them on the board. I especially liked her rule ' convince yourself, convince a friend and convince a skeptic'. I thought that this supported the children in their learning by encourage them to communicate their thoughts and answers to each other. I will be using that in my classroom!"
But I am the one person who could NEVER run through the jump rope and this would put undo pressure on me to perform.  Some people are physically challenged and I believe this activity would be a negative one for those students who could not achieve your goal.
"Hello everyone, I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Belfast, Maine.  I have been teaching middle school resource math for the past 11 years.  Actually 4 of those years were in Lifeskills but either way, I've been teaching math to students who struggle for years.  I am parent to one daughter who is about to enter her junior year in college."
Is it working properly? The domain is for rent...
"I agree completely, especially with the fact that when you predetermine for your students that \math will be hard\"" you are presupposing so many things. For some it won't be. For some it will be. And, to those in the middle, they may give up before they begin because they imagine that they can't do it anyway. Giving students a pass to make mistakes and making that ok would be one way to counter."""
"This methods open up your mind to a thousand different possibilities, amazing!"
As stated in the tile. All have been mentioned.
"If you are not making mistakes then you are not being challenged and therefore I am not doing my job. Mistakes come from learning new ideas and skills, not from doing what we know over and over again. Not only is learning the same thing boring it also does not cause any brain growth. Mistakes cause us to think and thus our brain grows."
"Dot Card Talks can allow us to realize that although we all use pattern recognition, the patterns we recognize vary.  And although the patterns we recognize vary, we arrive at the same correct conclusions."
No one should be ashamed because they make mistakes.  I make mistakes; we all make mistakes.  What will lead to success is making the effort to find and correct the mistakes you make.  The effort to find and correct mistakes is better known as learning.  Let me leave you with this clip before we delve into our first math problem:
This is truly a great story!
"Hey everyone! My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Quito, Ecuador. (Sudamerica) ungraduate, still study at San Francisco University. I work at a daycare with kids from 3 and 4 years old. Love math classes!!! "
"To learn something well and deeply, one must allow himself time to explore and make mistakes. It is superficial to just practice the easiest problems that you know you can answer. Work that creates mistakes is challenging, yet it is the root of growth."
"I am eager to share the cognitive thinking skill- building aspect of math with my class this upcoming year. Rather than just delving into the material, I would like to spend some time initially showing students that making mistakes is not only okay, it is actually what we are striving for. I plan to have students come up to the board purposefully after they make a mistake. I feel this will help many students who benefit from peer support."
"Dot card number talks are good at allowing different perspectives.  It allows for different voices, patterns, and ways of thinking to be heard without worrying about whether it is the only way to do a problem.  I think they are important because they allow for atmosphere of collaboration and critical thinking.  Students can analyze how methods are alike or different just as they did at the closing of the video."
"Many times when I have conferences with parents, they have a preconceived notion stating they had a terrible time in math and their children are þjust like they were in school and they do not expect their students to understand math, rather to just get through math_."
"Students (and others) often feel bad about making mistakes because they fell that mistakes makes one \not smart\"" or even  \""dumb.\""  In school mistakes are even more difficult because mistakes are often very public.  It is one thing to  make a mistake and fix it myself, but something more difficult to deal with when someone points out our mistake to you."""
"This is just one example of a really well thought out task, a task which enables students to pretty much back engineer what is normally given to them. Rather than asking them to construct similar triangles, this allows them to construct the triangles through problem solving then show them what they have produced. We have a saying when we are doing problem solving, 'DOn't tell the kids anything they can work out for themselves.\   In giving them the problem solving first then allowing them to discuss their work and come up with methods that would help them with the problem solving.......... You know how we spent all lesson working on our golf problem, let's look at what we came up with.  Discuss the similarities between the two triangles on each sheet - what do you notice about the angles.  Have a gallery walk, where students walk around and look at others work.  If you had photocopies, you could then allow students to measure and mark the work they see.  "
1. This exercise makes people listen other s reasoning.
"I think that dot cards are an excellent element of Number Talks because they encourage (or, stated more strongly, 'force') visual thinking which, I believe, is critical to conceptual understanding in mathematics. They also, in turn, provide opportunities for students to see the problem and discuss the problem through a variety of approaches."
Good way to show that people can think differently yet come up to the same answer.  I think it opens up more thinking allowing for new connections being made and hopefully more opportunities for people to try different methods.
"What it is important  for me, is how these students have changed their vision to math:a new, positive way of seeing math in their near future. They were aware of their abilities;of the many ways of finding an answer; that some ways are easier than others and quicklier than others;that math isn`t boring after all,it is challenging and fun; that mistakes are not a big deal after all, as they thought before; and that they developed number sense in all this class."
"Fascinating to see the different methods used by students to come up with the \answer\"".  It looks as if we didn't even see the myriad of ways to think about this dot card.  I was shocked when others didn't say that they had used the same method.  Again stresses the flexibility and creativity of math."""
Mistakes definitely aid growth.  There was a Wash Post piece about a school that does not return math tests so students do not get to see their mistakes.
I agree! Yes thank you Jo and your team! I was also afraid of maths and now my children will be proud of their mom.
"At the beginning of the school year, I let my students know that mistakes are welcomed. Mistakes are just a part of learning and improving. I would have students picture themselves learning how to ride a bike. I would have a couple of students share their experience. Everyone when learning to ride a bike falls off, and when this happens you just don't give up and walk away. No, you pick yourself up and get back on that bike, and continue trying. The more effort and time you spend the better you got and the less you fell. Until one day you were able to ride without falling.the same is true in our class, when you make a mistake, you shouldn't just throw up your hands and give up. You need to continue to work on the problem, until you have solved it. Making mistakes is a important part of our lives, everyone makes them and they help us learn and grow."
"I would explain to my students that the brain is like a muscle that has be worked out in order to grow stronger.  The best way to exercise the brain is by making mistakes; without them we wouldn't learn anything.  I would also tell students that they will know if their brain is working hard if work is challenging. That's why there's an -ake (ache) in mistake.  No pain, no gain!"
"I'll make sure and show this video, one of my favorite scenes from the Lion King."
These students felt by saying that 'math is free' they were able to do whatever they wanted to do to solve any problem.  They apparently felt that they were not constrained to follow rules to produce on solution with one method.
Thank you for sharing this story--it just goes to show that you never know.
Great.  Thank you.
ditto...I absolutely agree with your comment
"On the first day of Geometry class, I put up a picture of what looks like a large square with many other smaller squares inside it.  Some of these appear to be 8x8, 4x4, or 2x2.  I ask the students to count the squares and then share with the class how many they found and point them out in the picture.  After everyone has shared how many squares they think are there they ask so what's the right answer?  I tell them 0 because we don't know enough information to say any of them are squares.  I think it's a great activity to have students share their thoughts about Geometry and learn early on that it is ok to make mistakes."
I like this activity as a beginning of the year discussion. It shows how many different perspectives are represented in the room and then the various ways to look at solving a problem.
"This session has really showed me the importance of having students fully understand number sense. I think that incorporating things like this into your class as like a do now are important, and will encourage my students to start doing things with number sense and using dot cards in my classes."
"This lesson is so important and one I will be using in the coming school year! Allowing students to share how they saw the dots in their heads and figured out the total has two valid points: 1.) students will learn from each other different ways of seeing the same thing which can validate their own \new\"" method; 2.) it will help me as a teacher to understand the level of number sense my students may have and their ability to explain their thinking."""
"I am a middle school math teacher in California.  I have read \What Does Math Have to Do With It? by Jo Boaler and I have recently read \""Mindset\"" by Carol Dweck.  I am always interested in relevant math conversations."""
Hi Wendy! I am so excited for you!  What an adventure you have embarked upon! I have been an instructional coach in the Richmond VA area for 6 years and I am constantly looking for new ideas and methods!  I am starting my 19th year next year and am constantly learning!  Welcome to the group!  <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>
Thank you for the clarification.
"I believe that for many kids relationships with teachers are extremely important.  To hear that one teacher believes in you and is paying attention to you and sees potential in you, can be uplifting and motivating to some kids.  Many kids want to please adults so this is also an opportunity for that."
Continually mixing the kids in different way is great - in Math and in other subject areas.
It is very revealing to see how different minds see and think differently and come up with the same answer to the problem presented. This is important for creating that flexibility in thinking. It is also a joyful experience to appreciate the thinking of others.
"Mistakes are a necessary part of learning. If you are not making mistakes in math, you need to be more adventurous and take more chances. When you do make a mistake, you need to explore the mistake and exploit the mistake because it is by doing so that you will grow your brain and learn."
"Here's another similar activity. Fawn Nguyen shares the [Foxy Fives][1]. She has student's show their work on large white boards, and sets expectations on how students should report their answers."
They all seem to feel comfortable and safe in the learning environment.
"I teach middle school mild/mod students. I think the poster is a great idea and I've been reflecting on a similar \I can\"" wall."""
"After sharing some of the research with my students (teachers), I will encourage them to start the year by telling their students that there is no magic math gene. They need to let their students know that if the work is really easy, their brains will not benefit from it. They can make their brains stronger and much more mathie through tackling hard problems, making mistakes, and persevering through them. Kids instinctively know this about other activities, such as sports or learning to play an instrument, and they need to translate this knowledge to their math learning."
girls aren't good at math
I found I had lost some of my confirmations that I had answered the question and be going back and checking I achieved 100%.
"If you don't make mistakes you aren't really learning. You might just be practicing something you already know. When you learn something new, making mistakes is part of the learning. When you make a wrong turn or get stuck in solving a problem, your brain works extra hard and when you figure it out your brain is stronger and smarter for the learning. So don't get mad at yourself if you make a mistake; channel your thinking into learning something from that opportunity."
and in addition to learning how it is baked we will also nibble away at it over the year.
"I liked the way Cathy wanted to solve for understanding, making sense.  She kept asking clarifying questions to challenge her students to explain their thinking.  It was clear that her students were comfortable making mistakes because there were two proposed answers.  Students were comfortable coming to the board and explaining their reasoning, then asking for help if necessary.  All of these were good strategies used by the teacher.  She guided the discussion, but allowed students to explain their thinking to teach each other."
"people appreciate that there is more than one way to skin a cat. and it gives students tools, when they are stuck on a problem, to approach it in different ways. it's also a tool box for checking your work. try to solve the problem differently and see if you come up with the same answer"
"I agree with that, though I only teach maths, at secondary school, so can't comment on the reading groups."
Agree totally!
Very true---having to provide commentary is tough. Students with language difficulties are being penalized here to a great extent.
"beyond their saying that math was cool because they were free to try many approaches, it was also great to hear them say that you could make mistakes, because everybody makes mistakes."
I am moving from teaching middle school math to high school math this year.  I will have honors courses and one of Pre-Algebra with the struggling students. I look forward to always improving my ability to reach them.
"Some aspects of math are just harder than others, and only a few students can understand them. "
Thanks for sharing your story!
Kids get negative math messages from a variety of adults and/or role models
Perseverance means learning ..
"First, as an educator, I want and need to make math fun vs something hard that only has a right or wrong answer.  Many people are afraid of math and if the classroom community is one of trust and respect where we share and learn together vs to try and be better than others the fear of math will go away.  Hopefully my students won't think they have a negative \natural ability\"" towards math.  I loved the saying in the video about being really good at math and noted it.  I'd like to print out a sign that says, \""You can be really good at math.\""  "
"Thanks, Roger. This is a great link and a good visual reminder to students of how \mistakes\"" can spark new ideas."""
"Hi, Nathaniel."
"This is the same maths curriculum in Romania. We have a speedy Maths teaching in schools. Therefore, we do not have enough time for covering students' difficulties."
A training for teachers to use this type of inguiry based teaching would do wonders for all the teachers here on this site who want to make changes after taking this course.
"The middle school Formative Assessments provide excellent resources for teachers who are willing to use them. They provide the teacher with an idea on how well the students are able to pair linear equations with their graphs, find solutions of a system of two equations, and graph linear equations from tables. "
"Negative messages about math come from parents who have had difficulty, older siblings and reinforce negative feelings that students might have when they encounter frustrations in math"
"I noticed, too, the use of \understand\"" instead of an \""I can\"" statement.  I believe this may go to the heart of what Common Core is all about."""
"A teacher should not use any such words about any student, instead he/she should encourage learner to do better in every area of study"
I am going to talk about the brain and how mistakes actually make us smarter. I will have a poster to track our best mistakes and what and how we learned from that mistake. I am going to honor mistakes and the learning that they invite.
I totally agree...it's beautiful!
I teach a K/1 multi-age.  This is how I start my year with my first graders....Okay mathematicians we are going to have a very exciting year exploring and learning more math!  Sometimes we are going to make mistakes...and that is okay EVEN I make mistakes!  That's how we get our good thinking brains to solve problems and remember them! I LOVE math...and we are going to have so much fun this year!
"Yes, I have E'd the tech dept twice.  It is discouraging!"
"Caring for all the children in our schools means not causing harm to any of them. My school does not group children by ability because we (faculty) know that it's not a helpful or healthy practice.  There are district tests however with scoring that labels children as worthy of going to a special \advanced\"" program that are administered at my school. This segment on ability grouping has motivated me to push back with my district more than I have regarding this test. Maybe I can get rid of it."""
"I am a little confused. It seems as though ability grouping and tracking are presented in the video as being synonymous. Are they? I thought ability grouping was grouping students in small, informal groups within a single classroom (similar to guided groups) and assignment to a group could be short-lived. Tracking differs from ability grouping in that tracking is separating students by academic ability for all subjects within an entire school, often for longer periods of time."
Take a few weeks for session 1 grades
"The change would need to be a change in the way children are viewed. A fundamental shift towards viewing all students as capable of performing at high levels is required. Only when this is accomplished will teachers be able to look for ways to help students get there. Teachers must not view students through glasses with label-tinted shades. A student labeled as an underachiever will remain an underachiever.  We must focus on the student's potential and his/her strengths and build on those strengths to help them be successful.  Praise must be honest, specific and prompt.  Praise must focus on the accomplishment and not the student."
"What I don't understand is why they only need to say this about maths and they make other excuses for other subjects.  I also don't know why parents limit their children, I have always told my children that they should be smarter and better than me."
I like the hands on approach.
"Wish we all got training from the folks who wrote the standards.  I want to observe **them** in the classroom as we make this monumental shift.  I like where it is going, however, many teachers are ill equipped and working from past experience with older administrators and texts. We also have anxious parents awaiting test scores they don't always understand."
Patience is a virtue.
I think that is a truly awesome idea!
Mistakes are gifts!
I agree!
Sometimes math is about a process and not an answer - or to coin an old phrase the journey and not just the destination.  This type of task is geared towards enabling learning environments where students can come up with the process for themselves.
"class will be more fun as we make, find, debate, discuss, and share our mistakes."
I learned just from reading your response.  Thank you.
I think it is something we all need to pay attention too - as it can happen inadvertently ... which could be the reason in this case.
I think the dot cards have students visualize numbers which will help with number sense.
We all fall into the trap of thinking that our way is the only way of doing something. This task really seems to open up peoples minds to the variety and creativity that can be involved in solving a Maths problem.
Thanks.
"As a current Math teacher I want to avoid giving lots of busy work and making sure it is fun and challenging.  I hope to learn more about how to structure my classes so that this can happen.  I hear a lot about group problem-solving, but I have never seen it done, or at least done well. Kudos for you for going into the Math teaching profession.  I sense there are so many untapped areas for us all to explore."
It is he (not she)
"I totally agree.  I think it's safer, too, in a small group."
"I love this, <redacted>"
A dot card number talk gets students thinking about how even a simple act like counting can be done in a lot of different ways.  Such an activity also exposes students to the idea of breaking things apart and chunking
"I heard that if it doesn't continue as they move up, that NOW they have this tool, and they will be able to continue to use it"
![enter image description here][1]
Looking forward to the course
Please post responses here:
The dot cards allow students to develop mental images of a number and eventually of problems. These cards also allow to share different methods and ways of seeing the pattern.
"I have had students create their own mini golf holes where they need to show it going in based on one bounce and two bounces.  We used reflections.  If you reflect the hole over the wall that the ball will bounce at, the reflection is where you want to aim the ball.  It works pretty easily for bouncing off of one wall, but not so easy for bouncing off of multiple walls.  This problem could be extended to show that the path of the ball formed by the similar triangles is the shortest path."
They probably said... Math is fun.  Math is about moving numbers around.  Math is finding different numbers that work together.  Math is finding an answer in different ways.  Math is a way to make sense of numbers.
See [Sir Ken Robinson's video and read his text]
Seems like the question was not set-up properly on the website.  I had the same experience.
"From the video, doing the dot card number talk allows students to see math visually and help them understand math to be a creative and flexible subject. Students feel relaxed and are interested in other people's solutions. Since the problem by itself is simple, it frees up students so they can focus on how to solve it instead of just finding the answer."
Unfortunately this happens all the time.
"Raise your hand if you have ever made a mistake? ( I would raise my hand and give examples).  Everyone makes mistakes.  Did you know that is how we learn?  This year, it is ok to make mistakes, that is how I will know what I need to teach you and how I will need to challenge you."
1) free to do whatever you want
"I agree with that, but I wish add that the teacher can compare the different ways and finally, He/She can share the different answers to get teh sense procedure."
Different visual representations help to see different strategies for solving the same problem. 
"I agree, and I can see students who don't know anything about track and field giving up as well."
"I make mistakes all the time.  I get momentarily annoyed. Sometimes,I sleep on it:"
"I recall as a teen my Algebra teacher saying to me, \You're a Language Arts person aren't you?\""  I remember how insulted I felt.  Though I was doing well in her class, she would often get frustrated at me asking her to redo or reteach math problems and equations."""
I would like to know if gender grouping is ok?
"I predicted that the kids would say math is fun but what surprised me was the sense of confidence they had with math. Yes, we sometimes can make mistakes but we all do that and that is ok. It was no big deal for them. Their comfort level and confidence in their ability to work hard and do math was so pleasing."
This is an interesting video about Finland and their math education that talks about some of these issues: https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/the-human-factor
Good question
It also delays getting the answer immediately. They will have to wait to figure out what a synapse is. Maybe they will get a synopsis about synapses :-)   Yeah mistakes!
The best part was when they described math as being free.  I was also very impressed with their use of vocabulary such as decompose.
Learning from mistakes brings about an analytical conversation in math class.
What question did you answer??*
Ice break is a great way to know the student nature easily. I like this way ( Student Passport) to define each student individually.
"In the recent past, my school has tracked in math, and because of the size of our school and student body, the result was that most of our classes followed the same tracking from math. This turned out to be very difficult, as our math scores have remained our lowest score annually from the Star testing that is done at the end of the year. We tried a wide variety of things to get out of this rut, new curriculum, online instruction to \fill holes,\"" even new teachers and it seemed that everything we tried failed. As a staff (even non-math teachers) read Jo Boaler's book last summer (2012) and many of us (even non-math teachers) are taking this course. We have decided to \""untrack\"" our math classes (and all the others) and so far this year I am seeing students being asked to do far more than they were previously expected to do in both math and other classes. I am excited to see the students rising to the challenges being placed before them."""
"Hello everyone, I'm a colombian civil engineer and I teach differential equations so I hope to learn math teaching and learning strategies to help my students to understand math better."
"I think you need a strong sense of number to develop intuition about maths, feel that you are on the correct pathway or that you can overcome the obstacle on the way"
I completely agree!!!
"Take your time to provide accurate, well thought out responses to the questions given in class."
Very interesting idea about a hybrid system.
"Can you make a \Math is Free!\"" poster?"""
"Agree, agree, agree!!  Changing my mindset will help me to change my students' mindsets."
"My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> (Lotta) and I_m a Swedish math teacher working with adult learners, mostly grade 10-12 level mathematics. Many of my students have failed before and are not so positive about math, but they have to make it to get access to higher education so most are externally motivated, but I want them to get interested and find the joy of math ."
"Without the need to know we do not evolve nor mathematics, nor elsewhere"
"People can gain different perspectives on how to do maths. It is importante because it is smart to learn from others, you can learn one new way that you hadn't thought of."
"I loved it when the one boy said, \Math is free and I can do what I want...\"" What a great way to think of math. The part where he can do what he wants refers to his choice on how to break down numbers into friendly numbers in order to solve a problem. That was surprising and refreshing! I was also interested in the one boy that said, \""You can see what others think.\"" How often does a child think that???? Really surprising! Lastly I was interested in the statement \""There are 3-4 ways (to solve a problem) but nobody thinks about it.\"" How true is that?? Great conversation about math talks."""
I like the activity of having students create their own motivating poster.
"This one took a bit longer, but my method was"
"Thank you for that very valuable reminder. I'm still earning my bachelor degree, so I have time yet to work on **eradicating** that from my vocabulary, as well as from my attitude. I want to find a way to let kids know that math **isn't** easy for me, and that I have to work really hard at it--but I **will not** let it get the best of me. I want them to get the \persistence\"" thing. I'll have to flesh that out. "
THANKS A MILLON!
so hhard to find time when you have 150 students per day
"A lot of high attaining students get dragged down when mixed in with the \disruptive\"" students, which generates a lot of interest in parents in ability grouping, so their students don't have to be with \""those\"" kids.  A lot of teachers will similarly say that they don't \""have time\"" to differentiate for the higher ability student because their time is so consumed by dealing with behavior problems, which generates interest in teachers to use ability grouping.  How does mixed level grouping actually function as a practical concept?"""
Geometry is one of the areas of mathematics to which I find more practical utility. and allows us to more easily respond to one of the most common questions that students for what will help me?
I also see my students struggling to apply basic skills to a problem-solving scenario.  Students need to be fluent in those basic skills as well as applying them to other types of math problems.
Does she have a good strong group of friends that would be willing to hear that message as well?
1 x+(x+2)+4x=14
Really like this. Please share any that you might have in mind!
From their parents since I have was told by one child that he did not have to learn anything in school.
"I like your idea of saying mistakes are how we can learn, but I'm wondering if saying, \I want you to get things wrong!\"" portrays the wrong message.  I think valuing mistakes is one thing, but requesting them is something different.  Thoughts?"""
"Michelle, that is a great way to inform the students about the functions of the brain. I just had a training about the structure of the brain and I definitely want my students to know how mistakes help the brain grow."
"I enjoyed this video. This is how my teaching has swung in the last couple of years. I like how Cathy briefly introduced the discovery of the day and that there is a rule but Why and what makes sense? This is what I find students begin to struggle with. Especially the top of the class. Often they just know the answer. I see Cathy as a guide on the side, directing the diaologue and asking guiding questions, never saying no you don't have."
similar to what I do with my kids. we just were at the pool and I gave each kid a dollar. my son carefully weighed his options and bought the max candy he could. my daughter bought 45 cents worth and pocketed the change. (she's older and has learned the value of saving)
"I think since I have always lead my students to believe they are scientists, I will try to take a line from Mrs. Frizzle from Magic School Bus.  She says \Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy.\""  I need to put some more time into thinking about it but I think I will go with something like that."""
The use of dot cards in the Primary phase demonstrates to children that we all think about maths and approach problems differently - and there are no 'rights or wrongs'.  This also demonstrates that we can manipulate numbers in a variety of ways and this is what makes maths an art in its own right.
"When I was growing up, my third grade teacher always told our class that boys were better than girls in math. This perception had possibly impacted on how I performed as a student."
"This is interesting to me.  I had never really given much thought to how grouping can stagnate learning.  I don't have any experience with this as a homeschooler or co-op teacher.  I don't use grouping in my classroom, but it makes me wonder is some of the other teachers do.  This will be a great topic at our next meeting."
I think many students would take 200 divide by 25.
Is that a positive or negative wow?
"A few years ago, I added three small stuffed animals to my 8th grade math classroom.  Each one has a name and personality, and I sometimes work them into problems that I write.  Students sometimes take one and sit it on their desk or in their lap during class.  Over time, I've noticed that the students with the least confidence tend to do this most often. They aren't using the toys as a distraction--they just like to hold them or have them close by, including when they have a quiz or test. My guess is that the stuffed animal gives a little comfort and reassurance that helps these students calm negative emotions about math.  I wonder if this is an intervention to build on.  Would love to hear anyone's thoughts!"
Great idea!
We can learn the most from our mistakes in math so lets believe that and decide every day that we will make mistakes and that is ok.
I was surprised that the word free was used to describe math
Rapidly losing interest!
"We are all afraid of making mistakes, but in mathematics we learn from our mistakes."
We should raise the self confidence of the students
"The diagrams definitely help (seeing a visual). It really makes you work at trying to understand the problem. For the painting the house problem, you have to have an understanding of fractions and number sense."
"Negative messages come from parents, teachers, other children"
"using the dot card number card, people and students can view the same problem solved in a variety of ways. The example by the graduate students showed a variation of figures to create a math equation that added to the sum of 10."
The students aren't just asked to do they are given time to explore what the question actually means. Then to put their ideas to the group and convince them. From there the class discussion focused on the various findings. Cathy's questions and comments were very well worded ensuring that everyone felt all responses were valid. Also the students had to justify their answers on the board and they explored different ideas of justifying the same answer. They eventually all came to the same conclusion and that was given by another explanation at the end.
My ex-husband told me that I might get my PhD just by being persistent not because I was really smart.  Notice he's now my ex-husband.
"some parents convey the message that it is okay not to be able to do well in maths as they, the parents couldn't do maths and were still able to find a well paid job."
"Early on, make as many mistakes as fast as you possibly can."
"I would start the year by doing a very simple problem for the students and making a mistake on the problem.  I will ask the students if they agree with my answer, if they can explain what I did, etc.  If a student immediately recognizes my mistake, rather than say the correct answer to the class, I will have them come up and explain each step.  As they get comfortable doing this, I would encourage the students to ask questions.  If the students are comfortable and ask questions, the ideal situation would be for the whole class to discover the mistake and explain it.  I would then ask the class questions about what I should do. Then I would emphasize that I made a mistake, and that is absolutely OK.  I would emphasize that as we learn we make mistakes, and the mistakes make us even better learners and students.  I would emphasize what I just learned from them helping me discover my mistake.  I would also try to emphasize that mistakes are OK and to not be afraid of answering questions because we think we made a mistake."
What a cool idea!
But isn't a little anxiety a good thing? It pushes us to try harder and outdo ourselves. Maybe your assignments are outside their ZPD and better differentiation would solve the over-anxiety problem.
thanks
These are great ideas for leveraging the resources in your classroom to help all the students.
a dot card number talk helps students to see there are different ways of looking at a problem - it also helps them to stop and think about what they have done so they can describe it
"I will be teaching an academic strategies class (aka test prep) this fall; two sections, all 11th grade students. I am not willing to merely do review for test prep for 18 weeks, so we are starting the year with a unit about the brain. We will be exploring what happens in the brain when learning occurs, what conditions are optimal for learning, what we can each do to make our brains ready for learning, etc. In this unit, we will be discussing a lot of what we've talked about in this course--how synapses need to fire to make neurons grow, and that if that's not happening learning isn't really occurring. I think many of the students I will be working with are already disenfranchised with the \test culture\"" they've been working under most of their school careers. Many of them have determined that they are \""too dumb\"" for \""school stuff.\"" My hope is that this unit of exploration about the brain will help them to see that they're brains are all functional, all capable, and that they all have potential to improve their skills in any area. I'm intending this to be a rather motivational unit, and to then encourage them to explore what areas of learning they feel most interested in. I will then encourage them to pursue answers to some deep questions in those areas throughout the course. "
I completely agree with you.
The board looks too smooth and erases too easily to be painted. I had a classroom with a painted whiteboard and did not erase easily.
As a student when I would make a mistake in math I immediately thought that there was something wrong with me.  I was just to stupid to figure out the answer. I also very rarely asked for help...
You are right to point out that learning the attitude of learning how to struggle with a problem over a period of time without giving up can serve the students in all areas of their life!
I would like to say to my students that mistakes are welcome to our class. The mistakes are part of our learning process. Our goal in our classroom will be that our brain can grow and it will grow through mistakes
"I work at an elementary school as a Paraprofessional with Special Ed students.  One of the most disturbing things I've ever heard a teacher say is you can't do math & that's why you are in special ed.  I know this doesn't apply to all students but I have heard classroom teachers make similar comments to groups of students that they feel aren't getting the math concepts but should be.  Unfortunately this happens all the time but if a teacher goes into a lesson with the attitude that the students won't or can't understand what's about to be taught, chances are that's exactly what will happen."
I was surprised (pleasantly) that they felt math was free.  This is the opposite of how I think many people feel about math.
I am in agreement with you and am downloading the videos to share with not only our math teachers but other departments as well.
"Which takes time...and we need time, but need to use is constructively."
I would love to do this.
"I think that people can gain an understanding of how numbers can be represented/organized geometrically.  They are given a geometric organization in the dot talk, but perhaps the students might start to create their own geometric organizations when faced with a problem similar to \3+2+3+2.\"""""
I will also agree that it is a combination of A and B.  I already see many students struggling by grade 7 math with both A and B.
Math is teamwork & sharing and coming up with ideas. Its okay to make mistakes because we learn from mistakes. Everyone can say their ideas and come up with different ways of looking at problems. Then we all can learn by trying to see someone else_s different idea.
In 6th grade the inspection work congruent triangles geometry lesson IMIM not remembered how to write congruent angles and congruent sides.
The importance of parents as positive influences cannot be underestimated!
I really love what you have said and your metaphor of a maze is just perfect!
"I think people who participate in a number talk gain multiple perspectives both in how the dots are arranged and grouped, and in how those arrangements and groups are counted. Possibly, once all the ideas are shared, someone who didn_t þthink_ of a particular grouping or counting method might prefer one of the others and feel it is easier- and now their eyes are open to that and they þunderstand_ 10 in a new, multifaceted way. Like I read/heard elsewhere in this study the 10 was black and white, and now it is in color, or it was opaque, and now it is translucent. Ultimately, concerning the number 10, they now have a number sense- and due to the lengthy discussion, and þthinking_ about it, they should retain and remember that new number sense."
Mistakes are our new teachers
"I was surprised how they recognized that Nick teaches them differently.  He allows them to be free and answer differently.  I really like modeling \friendly\"" numbers and they knew that friendly numbers are easier to manipulate."""
"As an elementary math coach, I frequently hear teachers telling students they hated math when they were in school or that they just weren't good at math either. That does nothing to promote perseverance or confidence in their students.  I doubt those same teachers ever tell their students that they hated reading or any other subject!"
I agree!
"Girls and students of colour in this research have more of a likelihood for developing a fixed mindset in their formative years. The interventions work most with these groups for the statistical reason that these form the greatest subset of students with the less desired mindset. The experiences for this are varied, but at some level it must include the 'following of rules', with this group choosing the path \IF (action) THEN (success)\"" believing the only other path to be \""IF (not action) THEN (notsuccess)\"" rather than exploring other possibilities for example \""IF(Not Action) THEN (success)\"". This rejection of logical possibilities restricts experience, closing down options. The converse suggestion here is that the remaining subgroup, white boys, do explore more possibilities open to them, in self perception at least. Why would one group choose to \""follow the rules\""? One probability is that they are more aware of the 'other' in this case eg, the teacher, parent, and wish to satisfy them over there own desires. Restructuring the mindset then becomes an act of subjective self-assertion, traditionally associated with white males."""
There are lots of ways to get the same result!
"I'm just starting a MOOC course with Keith Devlin, who is mentioned in the references under section 8.  From his blog, it is obvious that he has struggled that some students have come through being \the best\"" and to retain being the best tend to put down and intimidate other students.  Could this be happening on your course?"
"Hi,"
"Hello everyone,"
"In my school, where I work, we only group the low achievement students, but we know, that when a student gets in this course, it's very difficult that he could reach the level to get out of the group, specially if it is a really low achivement group. And this will mark all his academic future."
"This was interesting to hear because I think Sophie is so right in that geometry is often taught as TOO ABSTRACT. Its ironic because people say \Oh, Geometry is all around us\"" or \""you can see geometry in everyday life.\"" But everything you do in class-everything we as teachers are expected to teach--is also the most abstract forms of that. "
The drawings really helped explain the math!!!!
"So I guess another thing that I can do at the start of the school year is to prepare a sample test sheet, already completed but completed incorrectly. And students can in pairs, first: answer the questions themselves, then see a sample answer sheet and discuss the 'correctness' of the selected answers and discuss the mistakes made."
"People forget that we usually only see the successful invention, we don't see all the practice ones that didn't make it! It's a great thing to realize!"
Teacher moves:
"What surprised me and delighted me was to hear the student keep saying math is \free,\"" and \""You can do whatever you want.\""  Math was not like that for me in third grade.  It was full of rules and things to memorize.  What a wonderful experience for them to feel free to break apart numbers and talk through their own thinking.  They are not afraid of mistakes."""
"I know I benefited from being able to see different ways of solving the same problem, and I would imagine that it would help students see that math can be thought of flexibly and that the ways we see numbers can change..."
Perfection cheats the mind of thinking and mistakes are good for you.
"In my school we used tracking earlier and I have taught both high achievers and low achievers and I found it frustrating especially with the underachievers who didn_t have any beliefs in themselves. They really had a fixed mindset. What I have seen in classes without tracking working with problemsolving (challenging problems)in mixed groups is that many times the students that we think are underachievers when it comes to regular math, are the ones doing the best in solving problems. They are less afraid of making mistakes so they dare to try different ways while the students who are considered smart are more afraid to do so."
Cathy does many things that were good:
"Go on . . . build those neurons! Make a mistake, I dare ya!"
"The fact that a right answer does not make the brain grow, but yet a corrected wrong answer does is a very powerful and visual tool to encourage students to 'have a go'."
"Everything that was presented in this section about grouping made a lot of sense to me. However, as I listened it sounded a lot like what Ontario, Canada tried about 15 years ago when math was de-streamed in grade 9 (along with all other subjects if I remember correctly) . The result was a complete failure and streaming returned shortly thereafter."
"There is largely a \setting\"" system in place at my high school.There is a \""top-set\"" and a \""Support\"" set in every year group and then the remaining classes are \""mixed'. The interesting thing is, that I find I need to differentiate every lesson (I have at least one of each of the above classes). I do not have one class where \""everyone's at the same place all the time\"". Every student comes with a different understanding and the best bit is when we start a topic and we find out what everyone else knows. I love the fact that I don't have classes of robots! The hard part to come to terms with, is the idea that these kids \""know their set\"", so they would be receiving messages about their ability from the \""setting\"", but hopefully not from my teaching and their learning :)."""
"Wow - what pressure you seem to be under.  I love though that you're willing to differentiate and use different language, so as not to convey any of the F.M. ideas we are fighting!"
I think people can gain an understanding of their own thinking by doing a dot card number talk.  I also think people can gain an understanding that other people think differently than they think and they can learn from others.
"Nice job on reading those two books, I have those on my list to read! ISnt mindset interesting?"
I was surprised they called their teacher by his first name.  I wasn't surprised that they thought what they learned was going to help them solve future problems.  They seemed excited about 4th grade because they already learned this skill about decomposing.
I think I am going to try to develop the poster idea that I described - using images of a baby trying to walk / stand up wit the message about trying and trying again until you can do ti. This encourages the concept of perseverance - that they need to work things out for themselves. I would have a second section or the poster or a second set of images linking the idea of making mistakes to brain growth with the message that mistakes are good they make your brain grow.
"Good point, if our educational system is in such bad shape, why do people want to come here so badly?  I am trying to do a better job than my teachers did, and I hope the next generation will do the same.  I appreciate Jo's approach to change things gradually.  I appreciate the ideas, and can see ways to improve my practices."
Wow - what an international group!  My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>.  I lead an organization which provides five year fellowships and professional support for new and experienced math teachers.  It's called <redacted: [US Math Organization]> (<redacted: [US Math Organization URL]>).  I look forward to learning from all of you as well as Prof. <redacted>!
"I thought so, too..."
"We do group student according to performance at my school for a thirty minute math intervention.  The groups are relatively flexible.  However, I do not feel I have the same high expectations for all groups.  My thinking is changing now!"
Thanks for the input.
"I believe that parents sometimes excuse their child( student), that if math was not something they were good at in school, then their child will not get it either."
"The number talks are surprisingly engaging and I think it's because something that seems simple has unexpected complexity. So people start out engaged, which is important, and then begin to really get a grasp of the problem rather than simply applying a familiar algorithm. There is also something to be said for how it makes math a collaborative activity instead of a solo one."
"I've noticed when students have to add change or count the number of items, some will group them into smaller quantities, others just add as they go.  I guess that's a way of using dot cards.  It certainly gives me insight as a teacher as to how they might approach a problem, especially if it's different than how I saw the dot cards.  This allows me to understand my students much more--especially as we do higher math."
"They can gain from the fact that they see that there are multiple ways to solve a problem and that their method is not wrong, but has the right to be there, is part of all the methods."
"I always had the image of someone patting me on the back when I was choking, instead of giving me the firm thumps that I needed with this type of 'encouragement'."
"Because my students want vey badly to be successful and and are moved by different types of evidence, I would present the neurological, research about students, and the mathematician's narrative."
yes!
"I copied this quote from one of the students, which I particularly like.- about combining different ideas to make the whole thing work."
"I agree with the research, but grouping is a band-aid approach to the difficulty in effectively differentiating. It is very hard for the typical teacher to provide the resources, time and instruction to reach the wide variety of abilities in his or her room. In the elementary classroom, up to 8 or 9 years of difference in ability may be present! It takes an exceptional teacher to provide opportunity for challenge to all those students."
Doing the dot card shows how many different ways to break up the numbers.  It reiterates that there is more than one way to do math problems.
In this class we all learn together. Mistakes are not the end of the world but a chance for us all to learn. We are about challenge and growth for the future.
"I approach my students with my own growth mindset, being careful not to imbue them with my own thoughts about fixed ability in the classroom. It's tricky helping students to challenge their own beliefs about their abilities. This video gives me some language to use in talking with students, parents, teachers and administrators. The idea of growth mindset versus fixed mindset is a non-judgmental way of opening up the conversation and I am looking forward to this year's start of school...."
"I would tell my students to try something, anything, when faced with a new problem.  The worst that can happen is that they make a mistake and learn something from that.  And when you think about that, that's not really a bad thing after all."
"I can try to do what I can, but we're about to start school here and I really won't have time to do much more than just worry about my own stuff...I wonder if there's any plans for what will happen if there just aren't enough people peer grading for all the responses at the beginning? :("
I am a 7th grade math teacher in the Kansas City area. I have been teaching for 9 years. I am always looking for new ways to help my students with the math skills and try to help them see that math can be enjoyable.
Why do you think that students can grasp the big idea through exploration but can't arrive at the correct answer because of their basic facts?  How do we build automaticity with our students while still building their critical thinking skills?  I teach 9th grade and I struggle with teaching grade level standards when I know that they have huge gaps in their math skills to fully comprehend grade level concepts.  I walk a fine line of trying to fill gaps at the same time of teaching grade level concepts.  Students get frustrated that they can't get the correct answer even though they thinking of the concept/process is correct.
"I think people gain problem-solving strategies.  Can I clump?  Should I count by 2's, multiply, etc.  I also think it helps build on their ability to notice patterns and reinforces the idea that math is flexible."
"As a an elementary teacher, I want an across the board group of students in my class so that I can have strong models for excellence both academically and behaviorally. But, let's get real, I don't want 10 different reading and math groups, and to differentiate science and history, and 8 word study groups along with preparing 20 some different level of writers for a state writing test. It is not humanly possibly, I do not live in a utopian world, none of us do. There are not enough hours in a day to prepare the lessons let alone review the work, attend the meetings, do the duties, eat, sleep, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. So, some grouping is necessary, to the extent schools promote it in today's structure of pass the test culture, no."
Right there with you.  I also just saw this problem in BedtimeMath.org and couldn't remember the solution!
John kestons a true mathematician
This contract only exists in the mind conscientious teacher and know what to do = mathematics understanding by each student. There are teachers who only work through the curriculum and to me it seems just so totally wrong.
I also teach both online and f2f at a community college.  I am always excited to know that I have colleagues who are also trying to figure out how to do this better and better.
Does this mean we don't do it?
"I love that they talked about being \free\"" - I interpreted this as being free to be creative and actually enjoying what they are doing, to manipulate problems into \""friendly\"" math. Great choice of verbs - to me it showed that the kids found the problems approachable, fun."""
"That was great. I knew the students solved problems in different ways , but to take the digits away and use a picture was a really nice way to see how creative the students can be. I guess I don't mean creative, I mean use different strategies to me!"
I believe that the reason so many students perform poorly or feel that they perform poorly in math is due to attitudes and a lack of mastery of foundational concepts before they are pushed on to new concepts. 
What struck me was how much she spoke about puzzles as opposed to math in general.
Number talks help with understanding the concept because they allow you to see other ways of solving a problem.  You can also compare/contrast those other ways to the way you solved the problem.
I will tell them of one of my own mistakes and how it helped me grow.  Perhaps its the frustration of trying to understand calculus -- so that I threw the book against the wall -- but worked with the accordioned book all year long to figure out where I had went wrong.  Or other mistakes...  I enjoy relating the story in organic chem where I missed the whole idea of positive and negative charges and tried to memorize every reaction by rote.
I liked how excited they were to talk about math and how well they understood the math concepts discussed.
"I have students who identify as being in the low math group.  They refer to other students as the \smart ones.\""  It's sad and as a private outside educator I don't feel I have the ability to effect much change with the schools where my students attend. However, I am thinking about this.  I will be sharing this information with my students and that's exciting!"""
"This does seem to be a fun visual way to explore (yum!) dividing by fractions.  I bet some of the kids \look back\"" on this to help them process what they do later."""
"There is a prevalent stereotype about math difficulty. Parents, teachers, relatives continue to spread the idea that learning and understanding maths is a special gift. You have it or not. If not, you cannot do anything to improve the situation. It' s a deterministic way of thinking."
"Hello Colleagues,"
"I teach first grade so my message to children will be simple.  Be a winner!  Make mistakes!  I think bringing children to the board to \show off\"" their mistakes will help!  The more positive I can be when mistakes are made the better.  I am thinking about giving a sticker each time a child tries something new and if he/she makes a mistake, he/she can get a second sticker."""
"My most traumatic memory of math is related to my high school years when I had to learn algebra. My father tried to help me at home because for the first time, I was having difficulty with my homework and my grades were not what they should have been. My father would scream at me to pay attention when I did not get it when he explained problems to me. I was paying attention but none of it made sense. I think my father probably was repeating what he may have heard in school when he did not understand something. Unfortunately, this message is still present in schools today."
Great ideas I may in fact do the same.
"This practice can be very encouraging for children, especially if the others are sincere in their words and actions.  It can be very uplifting and really help to raise their self esteem.  Good words on paper, could be something they might keep for the rest of their lives and could help them to turn a corner to improve their thoughts, words, and actions towards themselves and others."
"Love it!  I'm going to pass it on to our 7th grade teachers, but I might also use it or a variation of it in my 9th/10th grade class to start the year."
I two am planning on using this activity with my class. I teach third grade. I was wondering what grade you taught?
Using the dot cards is so important in seeing the many patterns a solution can have. Having the class doing them together encourages discussion about all the different ways to come to the same solution.  Each hears HOW they saw the dot card; what patterns.  It is process rather than product that is so very important!
"We grow our brain by learning new things, not regurgitating the prior knowledge.  Synapses are connected to prior knowledge and connections to previous knowledge.  The synapses are trimmed out by the brain that are no longer used.  so, \use it or lose it\"" is a great quote."""
"I have found that the student with the wrong answer has his/her own logic and has often mis-interpretted the question.  I always record the wrong answer and ask the class to think about it a minute and see if WE can figure out the question the student was answering.  This gives the student with the wrong answer a chance to walk us through his/her logic and often in doing so he/she will catch his/her mistake before the rest of us.  I think if a teacher deems a question worth asking, then all answers need to be explored.  Yes, this takes time...."
(put an easy peasy question on the board)
I think this is great!  I actually have a few children's names that I mix up on.  It is good for them to see that we make mistakes and learn from them.
"I think kids get these messages about math from parents, teachers, other kids, society, etc.  Until we as a culture change our views on math, I don't see this changing."
Very cool video.  It really is about how the question is worded.
"I'm going to tell my young students that this year everyone is going to grow their math brain.  In order to grow their math brain they will need help from their friends, their teacher, and most importantly from mistakes.  I will explain (using words and visuals) how mistakes are our friends and how they help us learn and grow our math brains. I will also include a few activities(I am still working on what they will be) to help them understand the importance of mistakes.  We will encourage and remind each other throughout the year that mistakes are our friend.  They help us grow our math brain."
"I am all about rigor!  I don't think she is implying that we throw out the formulas.  I think we want the students to understand (more deeply) why the formula works.  For example, I understand how to factor quadratic expressions and can usually do it by inspection.  But it very much deepened my understanding when I was forced to think about it visually as a rectangle whose area was the quadratic expression and side lengths the factors.  I teach factoring as a combination of visual thinking and logical problem solving, and let the students decide which strategies work best for them."
I was impressed by their enthusiasm about math. That they thought that they were free in their ability to break apart and regroup numbers was exciting. Also that they were so uninhibited when it came to making mistakes. It didn't faze them at all.
We are a mistake- making classroom and we love it. Our brain grows when we make mistakes. We expect to make mistakes and explore where those mistakes take us on our learning journey.
"These boys all loved maths and were so excited to talk about why. They thought maths was free.  You don't have to worry about rules, you can do what you want!  They knew they had strategies to solve lots of different math problems so you could see they had a growth mindset. They felt that sharing their ideas helped them see what others did and it helped them make mistakes.  Mistakes are good!"
Thanks for sharing - I think it is very important that we teach kids about how they learn before we ask them to learn!
"I like that word \new\""."""
"Beautiful, simple and powerful!"
I agree.
Hi Jamilla!  You are doing good stuff for us teachers!  Thank you for your hard work!!!!
"I have the same feeling.  The only thing that kept things sane for me (where I actually liked math) is that my mother forced me to think about everything this class has been teaching.  I have been trying to teach math like my mom forced me to learn math, and this class is giving me a lot of new ideas!"
"I have been following Fawn's blog for a long time along with Dan Meyer (http://blog.mrmeyer.com) and the rest of their blog \team\"". This group of math teachers is amazing and I continually glean many ideas from them. Fawn and Dan both take a standard textbook question and turn it into something more worthwhile and open-ended. "
"I will probably explain what i've learned here about how mistakes are needed to help the brain grow and that from now on in our classroom, mistakes will be appreciated and valued for what they are worth.  We will give mistakes their proper place in learning with the intention of growing our big math brains."
Have students bring up a time that they made a mistake and talk about the results of those mistakes.  Did some people give up?  Did others keep trying?  Did they eventually learn from that mistake?
"It was very eye-opening to realize just how many ways people \read\"" that card!! It just proves that there are many ways to teach/learn math!!"""
"I am going to explain that their brains can grow. And it grows when they make mistakes and take the time to figure out how to correct those mistakes. So I want them to know that mistakes are not only accepted, but also expected and encouraged."
"There is currently a bug in the Discussion Groups.  At the top of the left-hand navigation pane, there is a pull-down menu labelled \Show All Discussions.\""  If you pull it down (and scroll down), you can see that you have choices *other* than showing all discussions: you should be able to click on \""Session 1 Part 3\"" to see only people's answers to that question.  You should be able to click on other filters, such as \""Technical Support\"", and all of the homework answers should be removed -- leaving only technical threads.  There's a filter called \""Following\"", which should display only threads you have chosen to follow. Similarly, there's a section called \""Study Groups,\"" which is where I'd like to post some questions I'm wrestling with."
I think the biggest idea is that they think of math as free. I don't think I have ever heard that before. They also think it is cool and different than what they had learned before.They use and understand friendly numbers and decomposing which can be tough concepts.
I think that while presenting material I will discuss the mistakes that I have made in the past and what I did to learn from them.
Kids get negative messages about math from their parents. Parents have a hard time helping kids with their math homework and that increases the negative response.
"This year all identified gifted students will be in regular classes with all other students. I hope I can meet their needs, and the needs of their parents."
"I hope that with your admin/staff taking this class together you can come together and determine the best way to support similar students.  I appreciate the example given by <redacted>, however having sent kids out for reading as well as being sent out for math myself, my perspective is different.  Students who do leave class miss out on things that can't be replaced when this occurs at the early elementary level.  I believe that if you can work out time to work with the grade level above you, you can find ways to challenge that student.  If this won't work and you do go ahead and have students change classrooms please be certain that they do so in a positive and included way.  I genuinely disliked being sent out.  I wasn't the same mental maturity as the older kids, they made comments about my classmates not knowing enough, it was a VERY unfortunate experience that I begged to get out of."
"This sounds like a very considered way of working with low ability grouping students. I agree entirely with what you say about not wanting to sound insincere, it's likely the worst thing anyone can do for these students."
"Students believe what teachers tell them. If they say encouraging words,then students would know that their teachers care for them."
"Greetings from Vermont. I am a paraeducator in Burlington at a middle school with a large population of refugee students from Sudan, Somalia, Congo, Burundi, Liberia, Nepal, Bhutan, Vietnam, and Burma, to name a few. I work with many ELL and Special Ed. students. We do math together. I'd like it to be more fun and I'd like a firmer grounding for myself."
"I noticed that the students who really understood the concept were able to express themselves when explaining it to others. I think that is the key to the \making sense\"" portion of this presentation - once it makes sense to you, you can explain it in different ways to other people."""
I also feel that ability grouping can be both positive and negative. I don't know if one can outweigh the other enough to totally give it up.
"As a teacher and a parent, I'm not surprised by these statistics. There are so many reasons for this including: passing down negative ideas about math, poor teaching of the subject, not enough time for math play, too many assessments that call for showing the \best\"" way to solve a problem and generally poor assessments that show that a student can take a test, but not necessarily understand concepts."""
"They repeatedly used the terms friendly numbers, decompose, break up numbers.  I love the use of math terminology.  It's obvious that Nick uses these terms in his teaching often."
"I think the dot card number talks are important because they allow you to visually see how a number, as a quantity, can be decomposed in many different ways. It offers a great opportunity for matching symbolic and pictorial representations of number, and it provides an opportunity for students to listen to and understand each other's methods (lots of Math Practices portrayed!)"
I love this Stacy!
"I'm so happy to hear about your efforts! As Laura said, your staff is lucky!"
"When I was younger, whenever I made a mistake in Math, I always felt stupid and embarrassed.  I knew I was intelligent in my other fields of study, but I set myself up for failure in all things mathematical"
I too am a K-5 instructional coach in math.  We are moving away from Everyday Math this year and starting with Go Math!
"I consider myself extremely intelligent, but math has always been my failure. I am highly creative and test very low in the area of math. I hate math."
"I hope that our brains will grow- mine and yours- as we learn to persevere and problem-solve together.  The more times we fail, the more opportunities we will have to truly learn."
Dot cards help students (and teachers!) to be aware of how you can see patterns. If you have time to examine the way you think when you count and solve problems and if you explain how you are thinking and listening to other students you have the opportunity to develop in your number sense thinking.
"I have been doing these for several years with various grades at the elementary level.  We have also conducted conversations with the students about what they see and how they see it.  However, I now realize an important portion which we have left out.  There were always students who did not seem to be engaged after the first few moments.  Thinking back this was probably those students who learn best visually rather than auditorily.  We were bombarding them with meaningless talk about things they were not seeing for themselves."
"I think people can gain new ideas from dot cards.  New ideas as in, \seeing\"" new ways to think about how to group or how to solve, by listening to others' explanations.  I think people can gain communication skills by learning how to effectively and specifically explain their thought process and all the details -- clearly putting their math processes/thoughts into words that make sense to others so they can understand their thinking.  Then they can take those new ways and use them for other problems."""
"I have read that reflecting about the style of teaching and learning helps students immensely to reinforce the learning results and process, also for future learning."
"I was surprised to hear one kid say that math is \free\"" and allows him to do what he wants.  That is opposite of what happens when we teach them the formulas and only one way to solve a problem.  They also mentioned how talking to others helps them learn, and that it is okay to make mistakes. It seems like the class culture with regards to making mistakes has been set up the right way!"""
I had the same reaction!  What a wonderful view of math!  I'd love to have that same impact on my own students.
I also love how it went from visual and through talk they came up with equations that used properties.
without fear the student can understand deeply his mistakes.
Thank you for sharing. I have not noticed. I'm going to watch the video again.
Mistakes help our brains grow!
I didn't feel like the way the student showed the problem really solved my sense - with the drawing - even though my answer was the same with the halves of the circles etc I was still confused.
Good answer. Uses maths but then brings it into the context of the real situation.
"The NEED to educate teachers, parents, and students about the brain and growth mindset!"
"I suppose you have to realize that you have made a mistake first.  Once this happens, does the brain grow or do you have to figure out how to fix the mistake before the brain grows?  I have talked to regular Math teachers who have not taken this class.  They insist that you have to correct the mistake.  The the saying isn't, correct your mistakes and your brain will grow.  How does this work?"
Dot cards are a great way for students to start talking about numbers and how they fit together. I saw many different patterns and ways to see the dots that I hadn't noticed when I first looked at the card. I became open to new patterns and I felt like when I walked away that I saw the problem as more open and not fixed as I originally saw it.
Share the brain research with my preschooler_s parents and coworkers. 
Love how you pull the students into this.  This truly shows them they are respected and their opinion counts.
I was surprised by the use of the teacher's first name.  After I got over that I loved that they talked about the methods of math and thinking and never once mentioned that they liked math when they got the right answer.
It was fantastic to hear them saying math is free. Tab you can do whatever you want. My students would never say that!
"I'm not sure if you work with students one on one because of disabilities, but I feel that this also sends a fixed mindset message.  Students learn that they can only work through problems with the help of the teacher and fail to learn resilience and independence."
I am not much good at 'higher math' either.  I have taught 4th grade way too long....
"I love the program and the use of text with video.  Problem is, when I go to full screen the text blocks about half of Jo's face because her image is on the far right of the screen, just behind the text.  It would be nice to have the text scroll across the bottom rather than the side."
"Hi, fellow mathematicians! I teach sixth grade math in a public school in AZ. I am excited about this class! I have been studying and preparing for the changes with Common Core for a while now. I am eager to share what I've been learning as well as learn from you all. Thank you all for being here!!!!"
"you went too quickly after 1hour you can paint 8/15 of a house, you need to explain what you did next.  I was lost this way."
Like both of these.
Peers
"When my daughter started kindergarten, the teacher explained to us that the children would be assessed to determine their reading level so they could pick out books on their own, at their own level to encourage success with reading. To ward off parents who were concerned that their child might be 'behind' if they were in blue and not red, she emphasized that each child was at their \just right\"" level to remove judgment. A ranking, but in an attempt to accommodate and not stigmatize and foster an early love for reading. Beyond these early grades, K, 1st grade, when do we lose these growth mindsets and expect all kids to grasp all information at the same time? (By the way, some competitive kids recognized the advanced levels and at times would boast about their level-human nature, I guess)."""
"Students would like you to \just show me what to do\"" because that makes it easier for them.  But just showing them what to do is my last recourse. My first attempt at helping them is to ask them what they think they should do.  Sometimes they know, but are afraid to be wrong.  If they still don't know, I ask them to show me their notes.  Then I ask them to find the place in their notes where we did something similar, and frequently they can find it and then know what to do."""
5 not 10
"I think the Number Talk with Dot Cards shows all of the participants the multitude of ways people see things and think about things. It dispels the notion of \there's only one way to attack a problem\"". And we learn to see things from different perspectives."""
At the beginning of the year I will be sure to encourage students to watch for my mistakes!
Explain how important mistake are to learning.
That's awful!
I teach 4th grade and we also use Investigations and EnVision.
Don't be so afraid of making mistakes that you lose out on the opportunity to learn from them.
I like this activity.  So much discussion could take place at the end of it.
"I was very surprised to hear the child say that math was \free- you can do whatever you want.\""  I don't think I've ever heard a child say something like that about math."""
I am not surprised at the data and info about people's nightmarish attitude to Math but sometimes I feel people delight in that as there are many people who express this unfortunate fear.
Good luck I hope it works well for you and that the students will grow in confidence.
Love it!
"It's an activity that everyone can do with out struggling or feeling stupid, because there are so many ways to see it."
I have never heard of that gender bias before enrolling this class. I had a female classmate excelled at math. She was kind of person whom I used to look up to when I got stucked with a mathematical problem.
I can't seem to find it.
I can apply skip counting strategies to solve real-world math problems. 
"I also want to stress that if you already know something, then it seems easy.  Your brain recalls but does no real work when you already know something.  Fill your brain with new information!"
Good process!
Great idea to show how memorable a mistake can be.
Great1
The whole wall is a white board. LOVE IT!
I thought it was great that the students felt comfortable making mistakes.  I was also interested in how they described math as free.
I would have liked to hear from some of the female students in the class to see how their perceptions compared to the boys.
Brilliant
I think some parents send the wrong message when they tell their children they weren't very good at math when they were younger.
"Like a famous quote says...\if at first you don't succeed, try, try again!\"""""
it is fun to have people actually think about their thinking and to realize that not everyone HAS to think the same way
"Very nice response,  gives me something to think about."
I was shocked to hear the boys often refer to decomposing numbers and making them into friendlier numbers that were easy to work with.  I was also shocked to hear how easily the one boy talked about making mistakes and had internalized that everyone makes mistakes so we might as well learn from them.  My 7th graders could surely benefit from that thinking!
"Be brave and understand that when you make a mistake your brain is growing. And chances are if you made a mistake, someone else did too, and by us seeing your mistake, we can all learn together."
"I can't emphasize enough how much of a difference this would make in my ability to participate in discussions (at least, discussions about something other than bugs :)"
"I would ask students about the natural landscape and what do they think that flowers, shrubs, trees and plants need to grow? They would answer, sunlight, water, fertilizer, etc....I would then ask what they think that their brains need to grow? And this is where food, water, sleep would initially come in, and I would then discuss some aspects of neuroscience and learning and how the brain develops further when we challenge it, make mistakes and learn new things."
students need to understand the purpose and reason behind the formulas
I like to use a rainbow of colors...go light on the red
I also like this idea.  Maybe relating to something they have had difficulty with in the past but then had success-will definitely think how I can use this!
I like your ideas very much. I'm going to use it also. Thank you for sharing.
"This must already exist, but a poster of great mistakes in history, such as penicillin."
Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
I'm looking forward to this course because I **LOVE** Math.  I will be taking it from Vienna VA.
I agree that we need to let kids explore and make a mess if need be in the process.
"Just a suggestion for the \student\"" course: you should explain how to move to the next step. After the video it wasn't obvious that you had to click the little right arrow to get to the survey."
"I see one each \leg\"" growing by one each time."
I think this should be required viewing for all math teachers!
I'm anxious to apply these new perspectives and teaching strategies too.  There has been a lot of good information in these sessions.
"Thanks for sharing that, I had never heard it and it shows how to demonstrate our confidence in people"
PREFECT for staff meetings!
"I never really thought of the world being so geometric, but he is right it is all around us"
Like the analogy!
I'd like the message to students to be - mistakes make your brain bigger so make a mistake today!
"Well said, sounds like a poster in the making!"
I was shocked by hearing a student saying that math is like a tree... How creative this expression is!!! The students looked more mature and enthusiastic about the subject.
I think they are important because they illustrate there is more than one way to solve a problem.  It expands our thinking so when we are teaching students we are better able to differentiate instruction.
I WILL TELL THEM TO REPEAT THIS :
"I like your emphasis on using mistakes as \guides\"" in learning. Mistakes = Guides that gets brains growing.  :)"""
I liked their enthusiasm for decompostion and the ease with which they used the word.
I am not surprised by the data. I too had a horrible experience with math.
I wonder if telling students that there ARE two forms of math or two ways of viewing math - applied vs. pure - would help them see it as an even richer and more complex world. I don't think I knew about the ideas of pure vs. applied mathematics until I was in college with engineers and math majors!
I like the image of the brain grower bigger and bigger. It is something my students could visualize.
"I want to be \an agent of growth\"". Yes!"""
The one young boy seemed to be really bright. I think that the other two took their cue from him. Nevertheless they were acquainted with the decomposition of numbers and its use.
I know this isn't really the point but it seems no one changed the 25*29 into 25*(25+9) capitalizing on the fact that 25*25 is 625 and 25*4 is 100 and 625+100 is 725.  Of course you have to have had 25 square memorized to have it make any sense to distribute the 29 like this.
Thanks!
Mistakes are an opportunity for learning for all of us
Thank you for sharing!  Yay that you have found a fabulous Math teacher for your daughter! I would like to have the skills to clearly teach math to all students.
Ditto
"I,also, would like to see the data on this initiative."
"<redacted>--your two points: teachers and parents...a common thread. What are your strategies for the students that have \already give up\""?"""
I agree.  I made the same comment.  I want to hear it ALL!
Because everyone makes mistakes.
"I would like to hear from anyone who has gone from tracking to not tracking in his/her school.  My school tracks, and I have discussed this with my principal, as well as the research, and one statement I received was,\ You can find research out there to back up anything you read.\""  I know this is somewhat true, but I see year after year what the kids think and know about being tracked.  How do we get away from this??  I wouldn't know where to start!  I have about 2 weeks to get ready for this new school year coming, and I can't help but think I should be spending my time trying to do something about this--but what??"""
Very nice! Great visual!
Nice. I am joining your class :)
It's great that the kids recognized that Nick's way of teaching helped them.
"Hi Anna -- I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Connecticut and I have two children who aren't really comfortable with math. I worry because I was that kind of student- wary, shy, uncomfortable. Now I'm an elementary math tutor and I work with students like me. I get it, and I want to help my students and my kids. My daughter has just graduated High School, and my son is a Junior in High School."
"Maybe, or perhaps just implies that you can move from group to group?"
"Many parents lack confidence in math and share that with their children. Peers also influence negative math influences.  Girls, in particular, are at risk for negative math messages. Math is seen as a boys' domain."
"Actually, I have done some MOOCs with Stanford before but without using the EdX interface. I just thought they were having teething problems. Sometimes just waiting resolves the problem. Does not help with being able to speedily do the work of course."
"I would love to teach my math class like this. I teach math at high school in Canada. If I do like this, I only can complete 25% of my regular curriculum. Plus, I teach the same course with other teachers. We need to keep the same pace. If I do like this, other teachers will not happy with me...Any suggestions?"
"I agree with your comments, Jenne, but I have graded numerous answers from my peers; yet NONE of mine have been graded!  This is also causing me to lose participation points in module 1."
agreed
I agree
Look into '3-Part Math' as an instructional approach to teaching math.  It's an ideal way to teach for a growth mindset.
"I plan on comparing brain growth evidence to muscle growth, explaining to students that you don't get stronger by lifting weights that are easy for you to lift.  You need to work your brain in the same manner, doing challenging problems.  This means that you will make mistakes along the way and it is expected because the problems are not going to be easy."
How long did it take to get your real progress?
"My father used to sit with me after I got a bad grade and try to tech me. He was very impatient - almost narcissistic about my failures. He said to me once - \You're smart, you have good genes, why don't you understand?\"" I was too petrified with shame and fear to be able to think while he looked over my shoulder. There was an implication that because we were a smart family, math should be easy for me."
"the book is \What Does Math(s) Have To Do With It?\"""""
Beautifully written!  Are you sure you are not a writer in disguise??!
"Another 6th grade math teacher here! I am in Reno, NV and look forward to collaborating with all of you, especially the 6th grade crew!"
"It was clear that everyone in the room felt \safe\"" to share their thinking. I agree that the lack of inflection often kept the conversation moving."""
Sounds like you are on the right track. I learned math when it was all memorizing. I love teaching this new approach of having the students discovering the answer.
"I agree.  Don't feel badly.  However, I'm glad I learned my multiplication tables back in 4th grade (or whenever that was).  It makes math in everyday life a lot easier!  I guess it's just not so important that it's a timed test."
"I think tracking in math is counterproductive.  We do not do it in English courses at the small private school where I teach, and all the students seem to thrive.  Why is this not so for math as well?"
"THere are many good books out there that help with ways to differentiate the math curriculum.  One that I felt helpful was called \Great Ways to Differentiate Mathematics Instruction\"" by Marian Small.  Hope this helps :o)."""
"I said the Colored Squares were on the \border\"".  Also, do we really need students to come up with 3 different ways to represent this always?  I think it is important for them to see multiple methods, but it would take alot of time for all students to come up with 3 ways and many students would have trouble coming up with one way."""
applying math to daily life and taking the time pressure off
To make a mistake is the best way to learn! The brain grow every time you learn from a mistake. Everyone can learn math!

Still fighting my fixed mindset too!!!
I so agree... I was amazed that they so easily decomposed numbers and understood what it was they were doing - seems like a very high level of understanding.
"I second that! Definitely going to start using the word \yet\"" more! I also like your concluding questions at the end of each class. It encourages reflection."""
"I had my students come into my math class telling me that their language arts teacher said that she wasn't a math person either, she hated math."

Wisdom is learned from failure!
"Mindset interventions likely impact girls and students of color most because they have been the most discouraged by the words used to describe their work and work ethics. I think that the high achieving girls develop fixed mindsets most often because they see themselves as talented but also has hard working.  They know the number of hours they put into their studies and the choices they make.  They struggle and persevere in silence to maintain that \SMART\"" label that is pinned to them from an early age..."""
Hi everybody.
"When students want to give up as soon as they are unsure of something it frustrates me because I am a person who has been determined to achieve greatness my whole life, so I will stress to them the importance of never giving up and persevering through the tough times."
"Yes, they were so strong in their self competence.  It was wonderful to see."
So many students are getting this message from their parents.
"Hello! I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from the southwest of Sweden! I have taught math in grade 1 to 9 for the past 12 years and have recently finished my education as a special education teacher. During my years as a teacher I have often been surprised at how much we (=teachers) take for granted about the way we think our students think. It fascinates me every time I get a student_s perspective on a problem, which can be totally different from my thinking. I learn new things in every conversation with my students - they help me to become a better teacher. This is also why I signed up for this course - in our discussions we can help each other become a better support for our students!"
I loved the descriptor 'free.' It opens the possibility of creativity in math!
I agree that we need to promote a growth mindset to focus on what they CAN do.
Hmm....
Hello! I really love the course and have learned a lot. I know grades are not the real focus but I notice that my progress does not show an 85 average. I completed the lessons and am wondering why? Is there a way to find out why weeks one and four show a lower average?
"\You're a jock so it just not your strength.\"""
"As math specialist working specifically with helping teachers, I am curious to hear everyone's thoughts about the Common Core, how to best implement the standards, and how these standards have changed how we view math (if it has changed our views)."
I'm sorry the higher students didn't get some supervision as well - many need it.
Like this idea. Special needs students need this.
My children have had teachers who state that they don't like math and are not good at math. Unfortunately this does not set your child up for a very good year.
I agree with you. They need to know the basic before being involved in more complicated problems.
"\In fact high achieving **goals** are all from the worst hit by fixed mindset thinking\"""
I do agree that with students who have been damaged by grouping and lack of flexibility that making sure you challenge without overwhelming is very important.
"Hello all, i currently work in Corporate finance and i am looking to make a switch into education. I have an academic background in math, and i am always looking for new ways to convey ideas, hence my interest in this course."

"The dot card took the number symbols away and brought it back to how we look at patterns to help us count. The drawings didn't capture it, but the first person did (3+2)x2 and the shape was duplicated."

"...and since maths text book problems are never relevant to 'real life', the least we can do for our students is to let them re-invent the hypothetical scenarios (\own the problem\"")."""
"Big idea- math is part of everything small idea-be able to \feel\"" it, have feelings, math is adaptable"""
"I am with you that failure has to be an option if a student is to succeed.  Certainly we supply the way, but they have to take it."
Patterns and the different ways people perceive patterns are useful as they encourage creativity and tolerance to other people's ideas
I have no trouble using my ipad.  Have the best luck if I download videos before viewing. Good luck!
This is going to be one of my goals this year is to look for and create those kinds of problems.
Here is my math poster
Check out the show Team Umi Zoomi though...very simple show for youngest kids but it has a math is cool for problem solving/patterns theme!!!
Right!
I believe that the methods are outdated.
I think I'll come visit your class at the beginning of the year
thanks for the tip!!
"Kids and even adults hear that math is  difficult  from everywhere.  I washeard my young hairdresser say it as she  spoke of her  current classes at the local Junior College.  \ I am not good at  Math\""  was what she said.   I have heard  parents say such  to their children \""  You good it Honest I was Not good at math either\""  Non  encouraging words are heard by children and they take o this philosophy"""
"I thought it was really interesting to see the wide variety of methods that people used.  Even though this was a relatively simple question, there were several different techniques - just think of how many variations there would be for a more complex problem."
12 x 12 = 144
"I do believe that in younger age to put kids in ability group will set kids to failure. We need to challenge kids, but in high school, what we can do? If kids have poor basic math skill, how can we help them?"
"I'd like to see how a class like this work, too. If you can share more I'm very interested. Does the teacher present material to the whole group? Are they all working on projects together or independent work?"
"the fact that a child's future options could be constrained by external decisions from the very beginning is frightening ... and very telling.  What can we do to get this into the public dialogue?  I know the research has been around for a very long time.  Is it a question of \will\""?"""
Great quote
"I am in a unique setting.  I teach 12:1:1 and these are the students who cannot keep up in a higher ratio setting or a general ed class.  Within this group, I have varying abilities. I try to vary my grouping, sometimes allowing them to choose.  I do more teacher conferencing than student pairing, because often behavior gets in the way and nothing gets accomplished."
I went on line and looked up quotes on mistakes.  This James Joyce one is the one I like the best.
"I think I also did this when I was in school.  In fact, it wasn't corrected or pointed out as erroneous until I was a freshmen in college."
I agree. . .they have been the most effected by FM. It follows naturally that those two groups will see the biggest changes in their mindset when educated about the two.

"Here's another similar activity. Fawn Nguyen shares the [Foxy Fives][1]. She has student's show their work on large white boards, and sets expectations on how students should report their answers."

"For years, I have told my own children about successful people who achieved success in their field through hard work, perseverance and taking risks. We have talked about famous people like Michael Jordan, Albert Einstein, Lucille Ball who achieved success because of the above traits. Nike had a MJ poster with a caption \first on the court, last to leave\"" that same work ethic can be applied to math. Kids need to realize that hardwork + persistence = success. "
it's basically 20x5 minus 2x5  so 90
I love this idea of adding colour to algebra teaching and learning.
That will be my ultimate message at the start of term for all my students
I think it's similar with the concept of trust applied in Finnish education.
I had this eraser too!  Great way to present it.
I too go back to school in 2 weeks and want to finish this before then.  I hope the wait between sessions 5/6 and 7/8 is not as long as the wait we had for 5/6 to be posted.
"I was disappointed when I saw an advertisement at a Math Learning Center that read:  \Warning:  Your child could become crazy about math\""  Why a warning?  The underlying message is that no child genuinely loves math."""
"I think that I actually had a few teachers that talked about Math being hard, and \let's hurry and get this over with so we can do something fun.\""  I have plenty of parents that I've heard say to their children that they can't even do the Math we're doing in class, and that \""our family just isn't good at Math, it's not in our genes.\"""""
I like this idea. 
We have been given the opportunity to teach with iPads this year.  I think it will help a lot with skill building because the apps provide immediate feedback.  I am looking forward to using class time for more problem solving and sharing of ideas while having students work on their individual skills outside of class. I am hopeful that this will work well.
I will make it tomorrow when I get to work and have my supplies!!
What you have forgotten to say is that order of operation has narrowed the answer to 43. But all these outcomes are possible answers with these mathematical manipulations.

I was a creative type and that released me from being good at math.
"From their parents, old siblings and other children at school, I myself sort of believed that one had to be smart in order to be good at Math."
"Seems to take awhile to receive peer feedback, well over the 3.0 day estimate."
"Please explain what your definition of algebraic thinking is because I don't see it in your example; but this does not imply the absence of it in your example.  Yes, students can get this problem correct--I've seen them do it--by doing it the way you described.  Also, while I am really getting a lot out of this course so far, I sometimes wonder if the teaching of algebra will become \lost.\""  Perhaps I am being premature.  I have not yet learned how the reform school would have me structure, say, a unit or chapter on solving equations in one variable, by methods that are not traditional.  What I mean is this: Just what topics get taught as pure algebra and which others do we stress getting the answer \""any way you can.\""  Do you see where I am coming from?"""
Wow! You are an inspiration!
Hello - 
Our Math Department read Lockhart's lament last year as a part of our professional development.  Very worthy!
Jumping in late - just finished Session 1 and loving it!
"This past year my district used NWEA software that allowed us to demonstrate growth for students that were not yet up to grade level, but made good progress this past year.  I really like this type of testing."
Worksheets are typically tasks that are fixed mindset thinking.
right on!
"Hi! My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, and I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the comments! Wow! I am a special education teacher (mostly inclusion) for 4th and 5th graders at a dual language public school in Washington, DC. Jazzed about what all we can learn!"
"Apart from television, the most influential sources for these messages are their peers, with parents being a more distant second influence, especially as they get older. It becomes \cool\"" to hate math or to claim not to be good at it, so the social construction of math non-ability is perpetuated."""
"I believe it is a combination of both A and B.  In my experience as a Special Educator, I see students come to me at the high school level without the basic skills. I also know teachers at the elementary level who admit their lack of comfort in teaching math, which then impacts the student development."
"TV, movies, comic books, peers, adults in all forms."
"Hi to all,"
"I think that it is all reasons, except they don't have the ability. Some student might not the ability, but that can change by shifting the mindsets of thee troubled students. However, Algebra is the first abstract mathematics course that students see. Some students do lack the foundational knowledge to do mathematics successfully. A big foundational skill is that some students cannot read. That is a fundamental problem."
"\Coasting\"" is what I call this behavior. Some students do it all of the time, and all students do it some of the time."
I agree.  I would have introduced this with a real world example. <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>
"Hello, all.  My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, and I live in Somesville, Maine.  I am an ed tech in a very small school, and this coming year will work with a new age group (eighth grade males) who are tagged as high risk for dropout.  I would love to absorb any ideas to keep math interesting and worthwhile."
Heartburn...I totally have that right  now from these problems.
Sounds like they will be back up early next week (just saw the note in the Course Info tab).  Should be interesting to see if work done in those sections is still there :)
All of the above!!!!! WOW.
"In my last school our 5-6 year old ESL students were divided by ability groups not just in the class, but across classes in our 1 hour per day literacy lessons.  In some cases this did seem to provide students who were new to English to learn some basics, but beyond the lowest group who did need an opportunity for additional support, it did not seem to support the needs of the students appropriately. At managements direction we had to swap students around due to their test scores and at the end of the year I had a the deputy head come to me and say that a student in a higher level couldn't have a low score in a summative assessment in his final report because he was in a high level!  "
I wonder how your students responded to this. This statement seems appropriate for what we have observed on the videos so far.
Thanks for the video link - loved it!
I found the survey by going to the gray bar above the video with all the little symbols/icons in it and then I clicked on the second symbol/icon in the gray bar.  That took me to the survey. The professor mentioned that Google Chrome or Firefox (I think) were best for this course.  I wonder if this has anything to do with people not finding the survey.  I'm using Google Chrome.
"As a teacher at secondary level Engaldn ( 11-16 years old ) I do understand where this perception arises. However this is much more down to the teachers individual skill. In some cases teachers accept the first right answer and then just move on because they are ready too, what some teachers don't do is check for understanding amongst other students and therefore questioning becomes like a ping pong match between two people with the rest of the class excluded. More adept teachers will pass the question around the room and may accept an answer but the use other students to confirm the answer or disprove it..."
"I hear that from parents a lot, I wasn't good at math so my child won't be good at math either since they are just like me. Which is a very negative message for the students to overcome and realize that they can do math."
That's what I thought of right off the bat.  Am I right?
I agree. It is one of Finlands secret to success.
link also pasted below vvvvvv
The error message is: Error occured while performing this operation
"I was not as exact in my answer, but came up with a similar solution...Phew!"
Not to mention the Slinky and Silly Putty! Where would childhood be without these diversions!
"This one sentence conveys connection and relationship, positivity that makes it easier to be open to a challenge to your thinking or effort, and the expectation of excellence. It causes questioning, reflection and evaluation even before reading the comment to follow.  There is a lot to think about in less than a dozen words."
High school lends to easy tracking because of different interests and college intentions.  I wonder if the tracking and grouping is especially harmful in the elementary years where students kind of can get on a track for life.
"Ugh....I have been trying to end the tracking (or decrease it) as much as possible, since I had the low level class a few years ago.  Up until then, I thought tracking was the way to meet all of the student needs.  Maybe because I was tracked in school."
Expect not to know how to do everything in math.
This sounds intriguing. What grade level was this?
"When I was in high school my math teacher had each student draw a picture of what they think a mathematician looks like. The majority of students drew a \nerdy\"" type character with glasses and spots etc. This led to a discussion about how there is not just one stereotypical type of person who can do math and how it is important to be aware of this."""
I agree. There is a safety in numbers mentality and how harmful can dots really be?
"I am having the same problem, I am hoping to get some response and solution soon!"
Great idea!
I like this very much..
Good extension of division!
"Yeah, this study seems to directly contradict the point she was making. What I suspect is that anxiety impacts long-term performance (students learn to associate math with feelings of anxiety and discomfort, give it up eventually) but is not correlated with or actually stimulates better short-term performance."
"forgot to say, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from PA in the USA"
I find the discussion very helpful.
I agree.  It's a visual approach that allows for communication and critique of the reasoning of others.
I Love mistakes.  They are important tools for learning
I think that teachers and parents have to work together to counter students fears of math.
"I am curious about your phrase \I was always one math class behind\"".  Would you mind giving me some more insight as to where that feeling comes from?  I ask because I teach 9th graders Algebra, and there are students in our school who take Algebra in the 8th grade and then Geometry in the 9th. My Algebra freshmen sometimes come to me and ask me about taking Geometry in Summer School or doubling up on math classes as sophomores taking both Geometry and Algebra 2 simultaneously.  When I ask them why, they tell me that they are behind and won't be able to take Calculus their senior year.  Usually when I question them further, they can't even tell me why they think they need Calculus before going to college.  So is it less that they are truly \""behind\"" and more that they see someone getting \""ahead\"" of them?  Where are they getting this idea that it is a competition?  Or do you think it is just human nature to look around and judge ourselves based on how we compare to those around us?"""
"...I should add, I'm taking the class remotely also."
"Look at the second tab when you view the lectures, you will find the questions there.![enter image description here][1]"
"Thanks for pointing that out, Sanne, but I don't think it's incorrect.  Right before the equation, the text says \assume X and hat f(X) are fixed.\"""""
"One of the most exciting parts about hosting an online class is having the opportunity to meet participants from all over the world. We would love to hear about where you are from, what you do, and what your interests are in taking this course! Feel free to share below. "

Hi all
"Experiments are fun way to learn! Its a great way to learn about the body by makink it experimental, Thanks for using this approach."
I think that in the cases where the disease in question has fever as one of its symptoms cold exposure may have a more dramatic effect. As the body temperature is already higher than usual because of the disease the difference between exterior and interior temperatures will be greater which i think is one of the parameters for calculating heat loss. Fighting against the disease is itself a metabolic activity. Fighting against the cold at the same time will hinder the first. Unless of course the source of the disease (virus or bacteria) is less resilient to cold than human body is...

"Good morning, "
then I would look at other people that stayed in the water same amount of time they would be shivering intensely trying to get warm. while im in a state of Nirvana and just walking around naturally high from the experience and my whole body feeling normal.
I had a rowing coach who swore that we should alternate taking cold baths/showers with hot ones and then back to cold as a way of flushing the lactic acid out of our system.

"i agree, i never would have figured that out on my own about moving making you colder. When i am on a bike ride and am getting cold, i stop momentarily to warm. I always thought it was wind chill alone causing the increase in the cold. Riding harder to get home i see now was making it worse! Maybe eating cold food uses resources to warm the core against the cold cereal."
"Myself I was always told to keep moving around and not sit or lay down. We had to cross a body of water in late fall early winter after walking around three miles. We were eventually helped out and no one got hypothermia, which was a very good thing! So I believe moving around would be a good thing but at the risk of burning more energy and it becoming very tiring. So I believe it is the situation that dictates."
Hi! I am a junior in high school and anticipating a career in nursing; physiology could potentially be a core component of what I study in college (which can't come soon enough!!!).

"Hi, my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I'm working as a physiotherapist in out patient clinic and I'm really intersted in this course. I hope to improve my knoweledge and get many practical informations about dealing with stress :)"
Hi Nabeel. I live in a rural part of the UK and my broadband speed is very low so I sympathise with your situation! Watching videos on YouTube is really frustrating.
very intresting :)
good to know
"Hi, I'm a doctor from Romania, and I'm working in public health field. I am the Head of Children's Health Department in the National Institute of Public Health."
I never get used to the cold :)
"Hi Nguyet, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>!  Are you still working in Hanoi?  I taught in Ho Chi Minh City for 6 years before moving to Mui Ne."
"Hi Wendy!  I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>.  I have a strong interest in martial art as well.  Sometime over the next two years, I hope to be teaching English in Tokyo in so I can practice judo at the Kodokan and aikido at the Hombu dojo.  Hopefully at some point I'll be teaching martial arts as well."
Thank you for this post.  I had not heard of Tim Noakes and 'Central Governor Model' before.  I checked it out....interesting concept.
I think he's referring to workout clothing. I always wear cotton when not working out.
"Hi everyone! my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>. I am a recently graduated Physiotherapist, interested in sports, outdoor adventures and everything related to the human body."
"Hello, my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>. I¡¯m an assistant professor at the Medical University of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The country lies between the strongly contrasting continental and Mediterranean climatic zones.  It is assumed that Bulgaria is in the moderate climatic zone with four distinct seasons. Temperatures range from 30 C in summer to -25 C in the winter. In recent years, the transitional seasons (spring and autumn) are shortened and adaptation between high amplitude temperatures is quite difficult. I hope this course could be helpful with different perspectives on the problem of adapting to the ever-challenging environmental changes."
Understanding the Physiology of Cold is great knowledge which can be applied for future developments in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering. Don't you think?
Hey! This is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>. I'm also from the Philippines. I'm actually a Biomedical engineering major.

"I love the Standford online public courses and this one is perfect for me!Thank You!!! I will be getting WFR certified and a re-cert in CPR for my kayaking, ice-climbing, rafting guide job in Alaska this summer that will be a challenge for a Texan like myself, but a little less so due to this class. I will be in all these extremes so its good to see exactly what happens in them!"
"Be aware that if you are using an iPad, all the items on the modules do not appear. I completed the cold lesson yesterday and went back this morning to make a post. When I tried to post with my iPad, something made my iPad crash. I borrowed my wife's laptop to post to the discussion board, and after I made my post, I checked the progress link. It showed that I did not answer some questions from the modules. There are items that show up when using a computer that do not show up when using an iPad. I think there should be some warning, so people do not waste their time. If all you have available is an iPad, you might not be able to complete the entire modules. I am not sure if Dr. F is aware of this."
"Hello, Larry, nice to meet you. Hi from Ukraine :)"
Con / Improvement idea: it would be great to see how long are the videos in each section directly in the navigation fee (for example next to the little clock sign). This would help to estimate time I need to spend to go thru the material
Thank you Rich. Let us know if you continue to have problems accessing the survey.

"Hi! My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I live in Brooklyn, NY.  I am a Civil Engineer and am currently staying home to take care of my toddler daughter. I have taken one Stanford course online before to keep learning while I'm not at my \real\"" job.  I also bike and run in the warm and in the cold, and I have some friends who are pretty serious cyclists, so I am interested in how the body responds to temperature changes,etc. I want to keep us all safe! Finally, I don't really know very much about how the body works, so I'm taking this course to learn more.  It's super interesting so far, and I have been doing well on the quizzes, so I guess I'm learning!"
"That might be an issue with your laptop and/or speakers then, because I can hear the entire video just fine. Thank goodness they have included the subtitles for issues like this!"
"My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I am a school director in Germany. I am taking this course just for fun. And it will be a great challenge for me, regarding my skills in English language. And by the way: I am more the \couch-potatoe\""-type, but maybe at the end of the course I will get better along with my body and my age. Nice to meet you all :-)"""
"I'm finding this cold section interesting because you can definitely relate to it, more so I imagine that the heat/altitude/g-force etc sections. It brings to mind a 100mi bicycle time trial during which it rained very heavily about 65miles in. I had to do the rest of the race soaked through, on a very cold and windy day; needless to say it was freezing! While I was cycling the acute responses described here were present, the most inhibiting of which was the lose of motorskills... I simply couldn't change gears by the end, my hands just wouldn't work. Learning more about what was going on in my body during this time is fascinating and really makes you respect the human body; I was working hard on the bike, but my body was working just as hard to keep me alive."
Hello 
hi Joe i hope that we all enjoy the class :)i'm interested in how the body handel the stress as well because i usually get stress attack that i don't understand them so maybe now it will be more clear
hi catalin hope we enjoy the course

"Although hitting the wall (in Sapanish, p¨¢jara) apears mainly in runing and cycling long distances, my last experience with it (or her) was in mountain skying, and what I felt was like when you are in high altitude (lack of oxigen to burn your glucogen)."
Hello - I am from Wisconsin and prior to that California.  I currently am a multi-sport coach and personal trainer. I grew up a competitive swimmer and runner and have spent the last 4 years as a very successful triathlete.   I am hoping to use the knowledge I learn from this course not just for my coaching but also for my own training.
I work with the elderly population and I am eager to learn anything I can that has to do with the health.  I never realized some tjings about the cold. This was very interesting.
Hi Everyone  My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> I live in California in the central valley where we grow a lot of sweet potatoes.  I like extreme sports and thought this might help me to adapt better.

"Hello, Geetha.  I am in Fort Worth, Texas, in the U.S.  We have 2 seasons here - hot and one week of winter.  I used to be very hot all the time, but now at age 41 I find that I cannot tolerate the cold well at all.  I will be wearing 2 or 3 layers while my family is very comfortable. I enjoy our 100+ degree days.  Someday I hope to experience the heat of southern India for myself."
"Hi everyone.  My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, I'm an Occupational Therapist working in Canada.  I'm taking this course because had done a number of exercise physiology courses during my undergraduate degree and felt that I was losing what I had previously learned; thus, I wanted to take this online course as a review and make sure that I'm up to date with my knowledge."

Same here!
I wonder if it's similar to some buddhist monk's ability to change their body temperature through meditation. http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html
I remember my grandmother used hot bricks for her feet when she felt cold. She would place a cloth over them and rest her feet on them. I felt she also did this to relieve pain caused by chilly weather.This probably acted as a crude Avacore device.
Survival of the Fittest by Dr Mike Stroud is also excellent
"Hi everyone,"
"I am fully retired, in the sense I no longer work, but I am otherwise occupied with household chores, reading , walking and of course accessing the internet, using Skype and doing this course. Like you I too feel it is better late than never in getting to know one's body and getting the most out of it as well. This course is really very informative. Very challenging too."
"Kiwirip, "
"Hello everyone, I am located in Philadelphia, PA, USA. After taking a few physiology classes as an undergraduate, I realized that physiology is probably my favorite area of biology and I have been wanting to learn more physiology ever since. I find exercise physiology and the physiology of extremes to be particularly interesting."
"Having watched this, I am fairly certain I was in the latter stages of mild or possibly the very early stages of moderate hypothermia after doing Tough Guy (the original Tough Mudder) in January last year."
I think that hypothermia might not be the main cause of your shivering. Did you have received any kind of anesthesia ? Was it a complicated delivery ?
"Sorry about your troubles hearing the videos! We hear your feedback, and plan to incorporate it as soon as possible. Unfortunately, due to the lag in video production time, we won't be able to start boosting up the audio until the third week (Physiology of Aging). In the meantime, if you computer sound isn't loud enough, headphones or earbuds will help out a lot."
"If you navigate to where the videos are (or would sit if you could see them), you should see a button that reads 'download video'. When you click, it should automatically start downloading. Post again if you continue to have trouble."
Hi guys. I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Indonesia. And exactly I'm still a high school student. But I take this online course are for learn more than what I've got and meet new peoples from all around the world.
Excellent. Great to have you Jane.
"Seconded. Also, for anyone who is interested, there's an interesting article about  what it feels like to be overcome by hypothermia: http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/As-Freezing-Persons-Recollect-the-Snow--First-Chill--Then-Stupor--Then-the-Letting-Go.html?page=all"

"Yes, having hypothyroidism, I can confirm that. Living in a cold environment I felt very cold before I got treated with Levaxine."
"I haven't been playing soccer, but this happend to me several times. Now it happens when I go jogging. It is time for us to buy a pair of gloves, friend =)"
Hi Everybody. I am from South Africa and wish you all the best the course!
"Yes, there is a limit of five submissions."
"The first introductory videos reminded me very much of a Canadian researcher, Gordon Giesbrecht,  who studies hypothermia and the effects of extreme cold temperatures on the body (which earned him his nickname, Professor Popsicle).  "
I don't like the cold at all
"Hey all,glad to see so many people following this class,definitely I am not the one who likes biology...enjoy your learning!"
I hear people mentioning feeling a more lasting intense cold in humid places like Seattle than in a dry winter climate like Idaho. Is this similar to the effect of having wet clothing in the cold or is it caused by something else?
"Hello, everyone! I'm Kim from Southern California. I'm a stay-at-home wife and mother of three. I'm taking this class because I pride myself in being a constant learner and find myself curious about everything. Wishing everyone success in this course!"
Hello everyone! I am a cycling coach from Oklahoma; I enjoy learning more about how the body functions and cant wait to get started.
"My thanks to the entire team at Stanford and especially to Cory for being the \volunteer.\""  As someone stated in previous post, it is refreshing to see that people from all over the world are tied via wonderful interest in the human body."
"I would  guess he didn't warm up quickly on the treadmill because he was still in a cold room, and the exercise was pulling heat away from his core to allow his peripheral limbs to function, causing his core temperature to drop. I'd never thought of that before - I always assumed you'd warm up if you stayed active (i.e. if lost in the wilderness). Good to know!"
I've always found heat easier to handle than cold despite many people feeling the opposite. Now I know why!
"Hello!!  That was exactly my same thought, though I prove myself wrong.  I was in NY last week (the coldest week in NY for years) My first reaction was to keep on walking. There was no way I felt better.  My feet were really chilled, and I never felt warmer."
"Hi Jamie, "
"Alcohol can make you think that you¡¯re warm but your vital organs aren¡¯t as warm as you might think they are. Alcohol dilates the peripheral blood vessels near your skin, and that takes blood and heat away from the core of your body."
I feel like my past experiences in the cold are making sense in the physiological sense!  I am so glad I took this course.
"Aloha! My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>. I am originally from Hawai'i although I currently live in Tucson, AZ. I consider my heart and home to be Hawai'i as I move around a lot due to my husband's career. Professionally, my background is in accounting and auditing. However, I used to be a certified group exercise instructor as a hobby for 5 years (Zumba, Yoga, Pilates, and Cardio Kickboxing). Even though I am not teaching groupex anymore, I still enjoy being active - working out, dancing, snowboarding, traveling, and just being outdoors with my little one. My interest in this class is driven by my love of fitness and being active. I am excited to learn practically and academically how the body reacts to various environmental stressors. Not to mention, Corey's videos of real exposures was a huge draw for me to enroll. Thank you for taking the time to put this online class together."
I can imagine!  I would rather be hot any day!  :)
Hello Everybody
"Chris, sorry about the confusion. The video participation is for the story videos. The reason there are 8 is that there will be 8 video stories in the course, and you have currently watched the first 2 in the Physiology of Cold. If you have credit for 2 video participation and 5 CFUs and one exam, then you have completed the cold section. An email and update have been sent out covering this issue and other common issues."
The ice packs are definitely key for TT warmups. Makes sense - they are ready to go from the gun. Thanks for the feedback.
I was really surprised to learn that as the subject began exercising that he became colder. The assumption was that exercising would help warm the body.
Hi everyone. My name is Edward and i am from Malaysia. Have a nice learning!
Haha! Glad you figured it out. Yep. Gotta love those fire lenses. Great picture as well. That picture was actually taken near Revelstoke in Canada. One of the great benefits of the projects we've been working on-adventure and travel!
"Same here, would I knew then what I know right now."
Hello Everyone:
Interesting thought about emotions playing into body temperature...
"I would suspect that the after drop would be more precipitous for those lacking more insulation therefore being linked to body weight. Also, I would expect more wind to drive the warmed air away from the person's body leaving cooler air to claim more of the individual's warmth. Thus I would link after drop directly to all of those factors."
"Hello! My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, I am the head coach of a USA Triathlon High Performance Team, which means that I get to work with youth and junior elite athletes with the goal of helping them become professional triathletes, and represent the USA in international competition. I also work with some adult athletes individually on the side. I have wanted to go back to school for so long, and this class is just what the doctor ordered - I'm loving every bit of it so far!"
"My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, this is my 2nd Stanford online course and I have learnt a lot from my first tryout class so I am back for more.  I am interested in knowing my own body and this cold lecture has given me a lot of information and and knowledge.  I am happy that I signed up for this class."
"It was really surprising to me that I always thought that if you are cold, exercise will warm you up but just the opposite, the colder you are the more station you need to be.  I was telling my friend about after drop  and everyone was surprise."
So what I get from this lecture is people have more fat does not mean they are better insulated.
Hi everyone!
Hi. My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I love to study!  I have a degree in health promotion and love exercise.
"I had a similar experience last winter in a bike race. It's was about 35 f and raining. By the end of the 50 mile race I was shivering almost uncontrollably didn't have the dexterity to shift gears and no energy to chase down the winning move. I got in my car stripped all the wet clothes off turned up the heat to max, cranked the seat heater and sat there covered with a fleece blanket.  It took about 45 minutes to get to the point where I could get dressed and get ready to head home. I don't really want to experience that again."
I am also thinking the severe cold shock must require a quick exposure... Like you fell in vs meeting your brother's to slowly walk into the cold lake.
"Hi,"
"Hi all, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, I live in Santiago de Chile, I'm medical student at the University of Chile, I'm in fourth year. I enrolled in this course by the desire to learn more about human physiology and to better understand how the human body behaves in extreme situations and how he can stay the internal environment. Nice to meet you all"
Wow this is really cool!  To learn about what happens and every little detail to why exactly it happened!
I've actually started doing that back in late summer as a 30 day challenge type of thing(Random I know). I'm not sure about it necessarily helping your metabolism but I did find that taking cold showers and switching from hot to freezing cold water has me more acclimated to the winter weather. I'm definitely not as cold compared to previous years. 
"Hi everyone my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, I am from Australia. I am taking this course as I am changing careers from managing workers compensation claims to nursing.  I am looking to increase my knowledge of different types of environmental effects on the body.  Thanks Stanford for making this course available."
"Hi, Im <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Guatemala but leaving abroad in the Philippines, I have always had a hard time in the cold, and had the chance a few times to almost become hypothermic while swimming (not even in freezing temperatures), even though most of us are prone to suffer in the cold, there are people out there that go beyond the normal limits, here a nice article of a world record in the cold."
"I too am interested in the heat response as I am from Melbourne Australia (home of the Australian Open) and it is very hot here at the moment, 43 deg Celsius. Common sense has prevailed and play has been stopped.  Most people do not go out after mid morning to late afternoon if they can help it,(too hot) so to play on those hard courts reflecting the heat is not healthy.   In Australia we are experiencing some of the  highest temperatures on record this summer, and everyone is being warned about hydration and keeping out of the sun.  However I believe we need to look to the subtle signs that the body is not coping with the heat and what we need to do about it."
"Hello, everyone! I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, and I live in Los Angeles. I'll be doing some extended traveling in a couple of years, and I want to learn as much as I can about the human body, so I can be as prepared as possible for whatever elements come our way. It would also be nice to figure out why I overheat so quickly! Nice to meet you all, and good luck with the course!"
"Yeah, that is my life and I happen to have the luck (and sometimes the misfortune) to regularly alternate between the deserts of the Middle East and the snow frozen steppes and mountains in Central Asia -which I visit in my spare time there for adventure and leisure-  in fact it happened in a certain occasion that sudden traveling made me change from +35C to -20C in the 5 hour interval spent onboard the plane without anything on the way of appropriate multi-layer clothing."
"Interesting riddle. Here's my thoughts. Your base layer was cotton, which doesn't wick sweat away from your skin at all because it is hydrophillic and easily absorbs water. Your second layer, wool, was a good insulator (a common insulator like fleece) to the point that it caused you to perspire. Your perspiration could not be wicked away from your skin. Both the moisture trapped on your skin as well as that moisture being exposed to the air lowered your body temperature. When you removed the sweater, you were no longer so warm that you perspired leaving no moisture directly on the skin. So, even though you had a loose cotton T-shirt as your base layer, there was no moisture trapped on the skin being exposed to air. As such, you felt warmer without the wool insulator. My last thought, if you felt warmer without the wool vs with the wool but still felt cold overall, using a better base layer than a cotton shirt would have made all the difference. I know a lot about snow-sport base layers due to snowboarding but was surprised that there are base layers made specifically for motorcyclists that are both wicking and tight fitting, which would keep moisture off your skin and increase that air pocket you were talking about."
"Hi fellow course mates on this remarkable journey of self discovery, I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Chennai, India where it is hot for most of the year. I just can't imagine living through one of those North American winters. I did experience a fairly cold winter in both Melbourne and Canberra but that's the limit of my encounter with cold. I am retired from college teaching but not from learning and hence you find me here. Age is just a number!"
Hello everybody! My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I'm from Russia. I live in amazing city - in Saint-Petersburg and stude at University. 
Having suffered a cervical spinal cord injury am taking this class to better understand the adaptive nature of the body. I now feel cold a lot more sharply and shiver more often. Use layers of clothing to help the body regulate temperature.
"Hello everybody! I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Greece. I 'm a biologist with a master in environmental engineering. Unfortunately in the university we only had one course of physiology so now i'd like to acquire some more knowledge about the human body firstly because it's fun and interesting and secondly to support me in my activities (mountaineering, skiing, climbing, MTB etc)"
"Hello. My name's <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I am an enthusiast from Spain.  I'm mostly interested in the effects of space flight/orbit time on the body, but this course addresses extremes which will translate well I think to my interests."
do you wear gloves and layer the socks? need to keep the body extremities well covered.
"Hello! I used to be a winter swimmer (it's not so extreme here because i live in crete but it's really cold when the snows melt!) and I also swam a lot in rivers. I did those things combined with training in cold weather without wearing proper clothing until i visited a physiotherapist-chiropractor-osteopath who told me that i am damaging my skin that way. He also said that my lymphatic system was also blocked. He realised that from pressing some trigger points which tortured me. So now i m confused! i miss swimming and would like to try that \brown fat adipogenesis\""! What are your views on that??"""
"Spent 3 mos in Finland, it was cold, windy, snowing.....even inside I was cold all the time, when everyone was in t-shirts"
"Hello, "
"It's probably similar to when I am trying to read a book in a cold bedroom and my hands being the only parts of my body exposed to the cold, as the rest of the body is covered cozily. Soon, in this situation, I will experience difficulty to hold the book comfortably and resume warming up my cooled off extremities separately. I can imagine, that one's ability to play a video game with success would have suffered in such circumstances as well."
Hello people! My name is Art. I am from Russia.
"Hi everybody, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from New Zealand. I experienced hypothermia first-hand last year during a 100 km walk, so it is extremely interesting to learn why. I now know to wear several lightweight, non-cotton layers in order to create warm air pockets/limit sweating, and to spend a few weeks prior acclimatising myself to cold extremes. Gotta compensate as much as possible for my high surface area to volume ratio!"
I was amazed to find out about the different fibers and how they are employed to make such a difference and how they are used by the body. I am ecxited about learning more about the human body's reaction this way. This will stick in my mind effectively forever!
"From my understanding, people who have more subcutaneous fat, i.e. fat directly below the skin (as opposed to visceral fat, that around organs) are better insulated."
hello all from sunny singapore! used to be a keen endurance runner until i had a cervical spinal cord injury. am still working on my recovery - and have a goal of getting back to 'run' a full marathon some time! was very keen to join this class to learn how the body adapts - and hopefully use the lessons in my own recovery journey.
There is an interesting video about an attempt to induce suspended animation for medical purpose. It's fascinating how human bodies react.
Same here with Guyton's
"Hi, I am Brazilian, I live in Rio de Janeiro and I am a Physical Education teacher! My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> de <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>."
Don_t forget the autonomic nervous system. The effectors are Sympathetic system(increases muscle tone and peripheral vasoconstriction) and parasympathetic system (antagonic to sympathetic). I think we will see in stress
"And brown adipose tissue helps--not by being an insulator, but by generating heat internally without muscle activation (either actual work (i.e., movement) or shivering."

Hi everyone! My name is Cori and I'm currently studying nutrition. I'm taking this course to learn more about the human body and am so far fascinated with the material.
this is a great module! to understand what happened with the body in a cold situation is great.
"Hello everyone. My name is <redacted> <redacted> and I live in <redacted: [Colorado town]>. I was also wondering about the makeup of this course. Thank you for posting this. I am currently unemployed and in the process of changing careers. For nearly 17 years I worked for <redacted> <redacted>. This company is the largest manufacturer of hard disc drives. My background is Mathematics and Statistics and was employed in this area working directly with engineers from all disciplines studying drive performance and reliability. Drives are tested all throughout their manufacturing process. So, there was always data available for analysis. We also performed and analyzed design of experiments (DOE). In fact, while at Seagate I earned my Six Sigma Master Black Belt certification and became the focal point for Business Excellence which included developing Business Intelligence dashboards for engineering and management. This allowed me to use my MBA. I am taking this course to brush up on my Statistics again and update my resume for a career in Big Data. At this point in time, I am unsure if I will end up back in high-tech, or will be able to switch to something new like academia, market research, or.... It's very exciting to think of the possibilities. Good Luck."

"Just saw a BBC documentary on TV on hypothermia. They referenced a case with an Norwegian woman, Anna B_genholm. She got caught in cold water after a skiing accident and had a core temperture of 13,7 C (55,4 F) and was in cardiac arrest for three hours! "
Hi everyone! I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and i work as physical therapist in France. I'm here to learn some more about how our bodies work. I'm really exieted to be here. Have fun to all!

I live in Florida and cold is fairly rare so I quite look forward to it. At the moment it is about 50-degrees Fahrenheit at noon and that is a little unusual. It's sunny so I'm keen to be outside cycling. It was good to see some of the positive features of cold and I loved the rather poetic view Jill Homer has of being out in extreme cold.

"Hi, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>.  I live in Austin, Texas.  I'm passionate about participating in and crewing ultra marathons.  I'd like to meet others who are also endurance athletes of all sports, cycling, running, swimming, or others."
Hello everyone and Happy New Year.
This is fascinating and very informative! Thanks for this detailed answer!
Living in Florida certainly has its own set of challenges doesn't it? I live in Tallahassee where the temperatures don't climb as high as other portions of the state but the humidity is BRUTAL! I'm really looking forward to applying some of the info from this class to my real world training. Extreme environments is such a cool topic. Cheers
Sorry.  I just found how this works.  There ARE sub-forums. :)
"Thanks, Nashiwa. :)  I couldn't find replies to my post and, therefore, didn't see yours until after I'd posted my apology."
"Hi,"
That's a good point. I never really thought about the mylar blankets after a race. They never help me keep warm. I always strip off my sweaty clothes and put something dry on.
"I rub my hands together vigorously causing heating due to friction, open and close my hands quickly making my muscles do work, blow hot air into my cupped hands to trap hot air, put my hand on my clothes so it will have less surface area, put my fists between my arm pit and the side of my chest."
Water has a high heat capacity ( the ability to absorb energy with little rise in temperature )
"I don't know about Reynaud's, but occasionally my fingers turn blue with cold for absolutely no reason I can detect.  I figure there's a problem with blood flow and found a fix.  It's a high dose of niacin, not niacinamide; both are called vitamin B3."
It's an amazing story that truly underpins the truth that nobody is dead until she/he is warm and dead. It also reminds of the importance of basic CPR.
"Even it was the first week of the course, it was really fun and I hope it goes on like that"
Hey everyone! I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Texas. I am taking class because I love learning about the body and the response it takes in different environments. Good luck.

"The body is an awesome mechanism, its interesting to learn how the body reacts to cold. I had no idea that goose bumps were warm air trapped under the skin."
"This is so helpful since my two kids play Golf at a competitive level and they have to deal with some times extreme weather , so to learn what happen to the body and ho you can help yourself to make it less miserable I love the course.. its awesome."
"I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Washington, DC. I moved here 6 years ago from Iowa and have noticed how my body has acclimatized since I arrived. I'm more sensitive to cold, but have an increased tolerance of that famous DC swamp humidity. While I don't currently compete in extreme weather sports, I might in the future. I am extremely adventurous and knowing how to adapt or how my body adapts in certain situations will be very helpful on assessing risks."
Can anyone recommend good books on run techiques for VO2 improvement?
"I have always been a small person.  At 40, I weigh 102 lbs and am 5'1\.  An avid swimmer as a child, I would end up with purple finger and toe nails after much time in the water and covered in goosebumps even though it was 85' F.  At least I understand why now!"

"Hi, I'm from Toronto and especiAlly this year we are no strangers to cold. At one point it went down to -38C on the windshield. Also, having grown up in Sibiria I have experienced cold all the time. Thus, I'm more excited & looking forward to lectures 'bout heat and hot places:)"
"That's what I mean - great, isn't it? Next week, as mentioned above, we will see topics more familiar to us. Great course!"
"I'm guessing, but when you're doing something where you can control your direction in relation to the wind, try to go into the wind before you sweat so you will be returning with the wind at your back and blowing on less exposed skin. The activity of mine that came to mind was when I used to do some recreational cross country skiing, I would start with the wind in my face and work my way through the countryside so I was mostly going with the wind on the way back. Of course, part of that was for the wind assist! lol"

"Excessive shivering causes hypoglycemia. It uses the fast glycolytic pathway to generate heat but depletes glucose. The brain needs glucose, so it will very quickly stop the muscles from shivering when it deems it's supply is in danger."
"I often workout for hours at a time in the cold (in a sport that involves fast movement and therefore increased wind chill, too) down to single digits.  I dress properly and stay warm but not sweaty at any point during my time outside during a workout.  I am pretty comfortable out there.  When I get in, take a warm shower, dress in layers, etc., though, I often times have a chill that lasts the rest of the day."
"I remember a guideline for kayaking in cool weather that if the ambient air temperature and the water temperature did not equal 100, your risk of hypothermia if you end up in the water were very increased. I don't remember the time frame. Has anyone heard of that?"
"How to explain the ability of fibers like \Heattech\"" (sold by Uniqlo) to keep the body warm? These products, which are really very cheap, have helped keep me so very warm - much lighter than the cotton shirts I used to use (and I have not used them in a situation where I would sweat, so the cotton shirts were never wet and clammy). I'm guessing because they trap heat next to my body?"""
It's amazing the compensation mechanism of the body and loss temperature. Absolutely amazing our physiological adaptations to the environment. The loss of motor coordination due to changes in the types I and II muscles is amazing with *pros and cons!* The human body product of natural selection and adaptation to the environment of millions of years is incredibly spectacular! **strong text**

I used a lot of these techniques when umpiring baseball in  the cold months as well as in the summer.  Learned a lot on how to keep the body regulated.  Dressing in layers is also a great way to prevent hypothermia.

It's amazing how the thyroid affects people. My wife has hypo/hyper depending if her medication is not constantly checked.
"From what I understand, a lot of research is going on in this field right now- how to make additional BAT, how to change beige adipose to brown, etc. Researchers have succeeded in growing mature human brown fat cells from preadipocytes that were taken from a fresh sample of brown fat from a patient having neck surgery. From what I have read, researchers haven¡¯t found a way yet to essentially ¡°make¡± more BAT. "

"Thanks for the answer. Well, Guyton writes a bit about adaptation to cold, and aknowledge that the behavioral adaptation is way more important than peopole used to think back in the days. But he specifically talks about the increase in tiroxin and the discoupling of the respiratory chain, also increased metabolism makes people feel more hungry and more often. And just remembered this, he says we have a lot more of cold sensors in the skin than heat sensors, but i think this makes sense since we're tropical animals, and really need to feel cold before it gets into our heads."
"If possible, it would be very useful to have slides of the text that appears in the videos. I am happy with the videos and I can take notes, but the slides are cleaner that my writing.  I love the course. It's really great the way the Professor explains phisiology. Thanks a lot for this course."

"Greetings from Maine! I am employed in a family practice medical office, but am working on a number of online classes to prepare myself for applications to grad school having finished a biology bachelor's more than 20 years ago. This class looked interesting and fun, and follows on the heels of a general physiology class I took with Duke this fall. I signed up in part because I was curious about the Stanford edX format as compared with the other online course structures (so far very similar to the general edX). It seems like a good pick, and fortunately not quite as time-demanding as my Medical Neuroscience class. I'm looking forward to learning with everyone!"
Hi!  I'm Liz from outside of Newport RI.  I'm interested in taking this class to learn more about our bodies and how different environments and factors effect it.
"Yes, I heard that too. A quick Google highlights a report of this here: http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/17/medicalresearch-humanbehaviour - referring to a study published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. Unfortunately I cannot access the BMJ article."
"Hi every one. This course is very interesting for me, as I learn many new things and also find the reason of ancient suggestions!!!"
"This module was very interesting mostly because this winter is one of the worst winters Canada has ever seen. The city in Canada where I live is experiencing temperatures as cold as the planet Mars. I would like to understand the role of iron levels in the blood and how that effects a persons ability to adapt to the cold. Typically, women have lower levels of iron in their blood, therefore become cold faster in certain conditions, but why?"
"Doesn't consuming food also draw blood into the core?  So perhaps eating while sitting waiting for the rescue plane would be a good idea in the cold, but maybe not eating while you're walking around shivering?"
"I wonder if this works in Fiji, because getting \cold\"" there is relatively warmer than getting cold in Alaska. So it might be a very valid way to warm up!"""
"Yes, I have experienced it.  I habitually walk and run barefoot and, as with others who do likewise, have noticed this phenomenon: On a very cold day my feet will initially get very cold and white (vasoconstriction). After a few minutes there is a surge of heat and they become pink and warm (vasoldilation). My experience in fact is that the effect is broader than that: I feel warmer throughout my whole body when barefoot in the cold than when wearing shoes and socks.  It's almost as if an internal furnace is turned up, triggered by a thermostat in my feet!"
"Thank you so much for validating the use of case studies and scenarios in high school biology and anatomy classes. I really appreciated the information about how we link learning to emotions. This is information I have heard before, but it really helped to encourage me to start each unit with a story, or aha moment and add content from there."
Please tell me where the due dates for assignments/ quizzes are located.  Thank you.
I don't really think that temperature is so important for its main purpose which is keeping the insulin levels in the periphery in check. It's another question where these devices are having their sensors mounted. As if it's mounted somewhere on the arm for example when your vessels constrict restricting the access of blood to the hand it might cause the device to get false results as conditions in the different parts of the body would be different in this case...
It's really really a very good example! I liked! Thanks...
"My husband has just about no fat on his body.  He went to a major research center a few years ago and all they could tell him after all the testing and review of the literature from everywhere was that it was probably his metabolism.  He's always figured he can't fill the fat cells he has; his metabolism is too high.  If he doesn't eat almost constantly, he burns muscle (he lost nine pounds in five days in the hospital when they had him on restricted diets -- not good for someone in his 70's who can't build muscle so easily).  Some people want to **gain** weight!"
"Hi, I¡¯m from Southern California. I¡¯m an outdoor enthusiast and some of my hobbies include mountaineering and scuba diving which exposes me to extreme environments.

In Africa e.g. in Johannesburg and in the Sahara when the temperature drops I feel it in my bones, my bones ache. The outside temperature will be maybe only 4c but I feel profoundly cold in the core of my bones. Conversely in Europe I feel the cold in my skin and soft tissue rather than my bones. The temperature is often much lower than I've experienced in Africa (i.e. below 0c). I would be very interested to understand why this occurs and the scientific basis of this. Is it due to the higher levels of humidity in the air?"

"As a pilot I know the instantaneous effects of what we call Density Altitude. Which is an altitude corrected for non standard barometric pressure  and temperature, with these factors we could determine the true altitude(msl) and ultimately calculate the performance of an airplane engine.  Point is that air density plays a gigantic role in the creation of energy at least in combustion engines. How does air density affect Vo2 given the variables, barometric pressure, temperature and altitude. Seems like these variables would have an instantaneous affect on V02 when ever conditions change. For example traveling to Death Valley in the winter to race (very dense air)after training in Denver during the summer(Low dense air). Be fun to do these studies using a Hyperbaric chamber."

Been over 25 years since I studied anything formally so thought I would really struggle but in fact found the complete opposite. Think having a genuine interest in the topic really. helps. 
"skin area, skin exposure (more likely for head) and temperature differential.  The body tries to keep the brain warm, leading to relatively high scalp temperature when it will sacrifice blood flow to extremities.  I have no idea if the 40% is right (sounds too simplistic to be true at all times), but there is much more going on than skin area."

The temperature at 3:30 in the afternoon, during our cross country skiing lessons, was -40 degrees! FYI...At -40 degrees the Fahrenheit and Centigrade scales briefly converge.

Instead, I'm filled with awe that this young woman had the grit to undertake those potentially life threatening adventures in conditions that would keep even  hardy people from going to their mailboxes."""

"That's a commonly reiterated admonition on Les Stroud's Survivorman TV show. If he's working hard and working up a sweat (e.g., while building a shelter), he will strip down even in a frigid environment, lest he be caught in wet clothes when the cold of night hits."
"Hello, I write from Arequipa Peru, in my country there are places at very high altitudes, the temperatures are below zero but there are still so hot springs near these areas, wanted to know what would be the risk of finding a person with hypothermia in these places and just enter to warm in the hot springs?"
"I had experienced the sensation of hypothermia while racing one year. Started the day with 40F in the rain. Going toward the south wind at the back was OK! The turn back to the South was when the temps dropped and by the last 10k of the race my fingers, shoulder and legs felt like slogs. Took a few hours to warm up. Great information."
I have similar feeling as <redacted>.  Would appreciate that our request can be honored.  Thanks.

Surviving the Extremes: A Doctor's Journey to the Limits of Human Endurance
"I find it really interesting how everyone has different limits on how much their body can endure. There are some people who can swim miles in freezing cold water, or stay out in the snow for a whole night. It's amazing how strong the human body is."
"Hi all, my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I'm from Australia. I am a primary/high school teacher and have taken this course out of pure personal interest.

"I find the concept of habituation interesting.  My Finnish Grandfather, aunts and uncles frequently would use the sauna in the winter, then run out and roll in the snow.  He would walk outside barefoot in the snow, too. He would tell me to \harden myself\"" against the cold so I could survive it.  He would poke me in my round stomach and say that I should be thankful for the adipose tissue around my internal organs, it was my \""blanket\"". People from very cold climates should be interviewed on their ways to cold adapt."""
"I imagine this goes against \general common sense\"" as most people will just tell you that you'll catch a cold.  While probably not completely uncorrelated, it probably is enough of a deterrent for most folks.....beyond it being just incredibly miserable."""
"I don't think that you catch a cold from being cold.  The cold virus, like influenza, flourishes in colder weather.  You catch colds mainly from touching surfaces that an infected person has touched, and then putting your hand to your mouth, eyes etc; or from being sneezed or coughed on by an infected person."

Same thing happens in patients with low oxygen saturation - they refuse oxygen mask even if they are not confused. Only those with previous positive experience with oxygen take it at once.
"When I run outside, if I start out in gloves they are usually in my pockets within 10 minutes and my hands stay warm the rest of the run, sometimes hours, unless the wind picks up a lot or it starts to rain.

I strangely don't mind running in the cold but hate running in the rain.
For the last few months I have ended my showers after washing etc. with 30 seconds as hot as I can stand then 30 seconds ice cold three times each I find this very invigorating and also seems to help with muscle recovery after a tough gym session and particularly after a game of rugby. Not sure if there is any science to back this up but it works well for me.
Our body is an amazing mechanism! I really enjoy this course!
"I am one of those who take cold showers and don't put the heater during winter. I've noticed that my body produces more heath while i sleep, as per my wife testimony. I've read articles here and there talking about the benefits of Cold showers for the immune system, blood circulatory system, muscle recover after exercise, etc..."

"When it's below 40F, I wear a wool headband and gloves while running to make sure all the tender bits are comfortably warm once I warm up. Then fewer clothes are needed on the rest of your body."

My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from San Francisco.  The San Francisco Chronicle had an article which provided a link to the on-line class.
I have always felt the cold more than others around me. I have a circulatory problem called Raynauld's where the blood vessels constrict the blood supply to the extremities mostly fingers for me. For this reason I am careful in cold weather.  I was interested in the effect of wind on the core temperature particularly when combined with dampness or wet clothing. I was surprised to know that in relatively mild temperatures there is a possibility of hypothermia.

"Hello,"
"Hello: I had particular interest in the Cold chapters as I have been experiencing Raynaud's condition primary one symptoms for a few years. From what I have researched, this is more common in women and can occur with just a small drop of temperature. I have paid attention since I am very active outdoors and also sail in cold waters. I manage this issue by making sure I have warm socks and hand covers, hotties for warming up and basically making sure my extremities are covered in an overkill fashion BEFORE I am starting the activity! I was surprised this was not mentioned in the Cold chapters of this course.  I do now understand it a little better and the physiology behind the blood flow, energy and body function priorities, but have had to do much of my own research on this. Any additional comments would be welcome. "

Hypothermia should not be overlooked in geographical areas with temperate climates. Using a screening prognostic criteria based upon clinical and some laboratory tests may identify hypothermia patients with increased risk of death.
I have also been diagnosed with RA.  I have found a difference this winter with the extreme cold we are having that even moving around out in the cold (working by shoveling snow) my joints (hips and feet) get stiff and are very painful.  Not sure why this is the case this year and not in the past.

Whereas on a recent trip to Boston - where I used to live, I was the only person running around without a jacket.

Interesting. I've only started the Heat section but I love it as it ties into several classes I've taken from Stacy Sims and thermoregulation. I would not have thought about swimmers. Good point.
Getting cold is NOT correlated with getting a cold.

I have a strong interest in teaching science through storytelling and in finding ways to help adolescents learn about human biology. At that age, most young people are very anxious about human biology, but VERY interested in issues of survival and testing the limits. I suspect that environmental physiology may be a way to get them excited about how their bodies work and what human beings are capable of."
new modules are posted every week on monday as far as i know.  you can also find an overview in the course info. the module about ageing will be uploaded on the 27th.
Completed unit 1 and came away with the conclusion that Bear Grylls rewarming method after cold water immersion of wet clothing removal followed by vigorous exercise may not be the way to go due to the after drop factor.  Think the curling up in semi fetal position in front of a warm fire is now the better option.
Bear in maind the amount of fat as insulators that those mamifers have. The fat is the best insulator y colder environments

"Stress on the body by cold, heat, exercise, emotional stress, etc. does compromise our immune system and can make us more susceptible to picking up a cold, other viruses or infections. I don't know all the science behind it, but I have read studies regarding such."
"This is a really common misconception, Boipelo.  We don't catch \colds\"" from exposure to cold temperatures.  As NinaS1 stated, colds come from infection with a virus.  Exposure to cold temperatures can, however, make the severity of a preexisting or just emerging cold worse because any time the body is stressed, it impairs our normal body defenses and our abilities to fight off a disease."""
"or fear, lol"
"They might be using your age to figure your maximum heart rate.  A 60 year old female would have a max of 150 according to one of the formulas.  But each individual is different so your max might be much higher.  My max heart should be 171 but I can't get it above 155.  I do have a resting heart rate of 40, a little below the average."
"It is not just less blood flow, as the brain is not really peripheral circulation, but rather the reduced temperature as the body's core temperature drops that impairs mental ability.  As hypothermia advances, disorientation, confusion, and delirium are rather common as the brain becomes more impaired.  Cooling of cells causes them to work more sluggishly (metabolism drops)."
"I had taken a Wilderness First responder course, when we covered *Hypothermia* the instructor cautioned us during our initial assessment of a practice unconscious victim. A quick check of the ABC's - Airway, Breathing and Circulation -  may inadvertently lead a rescuer into thinking the heart has stooped, when it actually is still beating at a very slow rate. The take away was if Hypothermia was suspected at all, to check for pulse for a much longer period before attempting rescue CPR."

"It is a very interesting topic, especially if one day you decide to climb a mountain very cold."
"One thing that I have experienced exercising in the heat is getting a bloody nose.  This seems to be a common theme for kids around 10 to 12 years old, as I take them hiking in the mountains quite regularly.  I have seen this in many boyscouts and also all three of my kids.  If it is above 90 degrees and we are going up, I hand out the tissues to the ones in need.  I assume this is just vasodilation and the dry air combine to stress the nasal vessels, but would like feedback since it is so common."
excellent explanation of the cardiac output and VO2 max
Thanks for the book apriori...!!All d best everyone for the learning sessions..!!
Videos are stored in YouTube. For instance Lecture 2.1 is:
"I really didn't have my temperature measure, but you can imagine: it was winter, I walked up at 5:30 a.m., it was missing electrical energy in my apt, so I had to take my shower with cold water, right after wake up, with an outside temperature near to zero degrees Celsius. Yeah, it was pretty cold. The worse part is that I couldn't stop shivering even after leaving the shower, just like the guy in the lectures. Really crazy experience. And I guess I'd be almost ok if they haven't taken 5 months to fix the electrical issue of the building!!!!"
After drop is an interesting response.  I have observed it in hypothermia victims and is difficult to handle in rescue scenarios.
"Hi Ryan, I'm outside<redacted: [Massachusetts town]> area. Drop me a line."
"As a competitive masters swimmer, I find that it takes me some time to really start to feel 'warm' in the water. I would think that swimmers have to work comparatively harder to achieve the same 'heat stress' on the body than athletes in air. I also find that it's not until I stop swimming that I actually start to feel hot. Maybe really excessive training may result in heat exhaustion in very warm water, but I think the coolness of the water is generally enough to remove the heat effectively. However, in this type of exercise, there can be no evaporation as the main cooling mechanism (as shown in the graph) because the environment is 100% humidity."
"Yes, but I don't think many people would actually exercise in water above body temperature, as it would feel hot. However, in the closer the temperature of the water to 37 degrees C, the slower the cooling of the swimmer."

Hello ! my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> . I'm from Moscow Russia.
That's true! the audio is very low!
"Dear colleagues, "
"In my experience, watching other runners do just what you suggest, to push the pace in a long race early on when the weather is cooler.... they ended up having trouble finishing the race.  You need to manage the race distance. Starting at a faster than race pace to make up for needing to go slow in the heat later on does not work well.  Picture that the weather stayed cool all day: then perhaps you could slow down and gain benefits from it in the second half of the race, since the weather is still reasonable and the slower pace gives you a break.  In your scenario, you do not gain any benefit from the slower pace, it is instead forced on you because of the heat.  After overtaxing yourself early, you would have a much harder time coping with the heat and finding a comfortable pace to get yourself to the finish."
"0.05 at the left side, 0.05 at the right side."
"Sorry, I meet the same problem as above classmates. We're not able to access Youtube resources. Could the administrators help us out? Thanks!Jerry"
"It'll be very helpful too in China, also very low speed and exhausting problem to online learning. Thanks!"
"Even in High Definition mode, and with the video set to display at Full Screen, it is difficult to see the lines at the bottom of the window where each operation that you talk about is being shown."
"One of the acclimatizations to heat is the increase in blood volume; all else equal, would we expect to weigh more in the Summer than Winter?  If so, how much would the difference be?"
"I was thinking of the hypothetical scenario of needing to help cool down a persons body suffering from heat stroke, I was wanting a more accurate idea of how cold the water should be to have maximal effect in cooling down the person, but not too cold to induce localized vasoconstriction. I have seen ice packs used, but is this not potentially too cold? Also am I correct in thinking that, running cool water would be the most effective form of coolant, as apposed to cold compress and ice packs?"
"I also have minor problem with slides / playing video - in Opera 12.16 (build 1860 windows 7 x64) the \Fill Browser\"" button incorrectly scales video player frame: it became even smaller!"
"Dear colleagues, "
agree with  that also
"Hypo or Hyper? I was wondering if some people who lives in the really hot areas could suffer a sweat gland loss of function too, even if they arent exercising or something."
Hi. In line 35 of the downlodable R code for chapter two (ch2.R) appear written **pwd()** that actually looks much as python code. It should be used **getwd()** instead of pwd() as It does not work in R.
"Same as the other students, but I'm here in the States.  The connection is unstable, runs for about 18 seconds and ends.  I would like a download link too as I've used it for other courses like Coursera to get around the connection."

"Me too. It would be very helpful to apply the download link for materials like video, slide. For part of us, the video file format \mp4\"" would be convenient for download. Thank you!"""
"is there not some evidence that while women may be most senitive to chill, there are also less likely to succumb -- be incapacitated or die? it would be interesting to see a comparison covering both psychological factors and the phyiological ones (energy production from shivering, metabolic rate, heat loss factors like fat distribition, mass-to-surface area, etc). Are psychological factors indeed largely irrelevant?"
Thank you sir for opening the course. looking forward to the next lectures.
pretty sure 50% overall
Me too. It would be very helpful to apply the download link for materials like video.
"I imagine mental training can overcome many physical problems but we need to make sure that there is logic to the training. If we push ourselves **beyond our actual limit**, as appose to what central fatigue makes us think is our limit, we run the risk of physical damage."
Is there any quiz from chapter 1?
"Is there any spanish speaking people interested in creating a group for discussing, just in case, different topics of the course in our mother tongue?"

Will we receive a personalized certificate in case of satisfactory work?
"Speaking of sound quality: I notice that I have to turn up the volume to listen to the mini-lectures. Of course, that's not a problem. What is a problem is that the volume seems to shift from one section to the other in the same lecture. A constant volume at least during one lecture would be good. I'm easily distracted and find I need to go back during the lecture to make up what I missed while noticing that I once again have to adjust the volume."
I use a Nuun tablet dissolved in water after I run say 6 miles or more.
"While I was in Jordan I saw Bedouins wearing black robes in the desert heat. Doesn't this seem counter-intuitive? They said it didn't make any difference what color it was, it was better to be wrapped in loose fitting robes than not."
"I experienced the same thing.  (At least it will keep  my winter heating bill down.) Also, my doctor has noticed that she has to adjust my blood pressure medicine in the winter and in the summer.  I live in Chicago and the ambient temperature can be well over a hundred degrees different in the two seasons."
I entirely agree!
Three things we all should remember going forward:
"As was discussed in the previous module on cold where it was noted that Inuit populations who are chronically exposed to hypothermic conditions have developed more of a \Hunter's Response\"" and habituation to cold disconfort, is the same true (albeit different physiologic responses) for populations in chronically high temp/high humidity environments? Since evaporative cooling would contribute little effect in such a climate, how does the body cool itself down? Or is it just a function of habitually exerting one's self less?"""

"Hi Joe! I'm from New England as well and have begun participating in many different kinds of athletic events since I turned 40.  This weekend I am participating in the \Winter Wild Event\"" at Sunday River in Maine, USA which involves running 4 miles, both up and down the mountain.  I am so glad we started with the cold section because temps this weekend are supposed to be subzero and the race begins at 7am.  I am concerned about how my body will react to the cold, but feel better prepared after completing the first week of lessons.  Good luck to you! I hope you learn all you need to be a successful athlete! :)"""
"Shouldn't we also use low-tech aids, as well?  If you're an athlete, should you drink ice-cold water (or electrolyte sports drink) to cool the core? Or is it bad for your body to drink ice-cold drinks during your performance? And -- if you're hypothermic, shouldn't you drink a hot drink to help warm the core?  Thanks in advance for people's feedback!"

"In Florida, during the summer the temperatures will soar to 100 - 105 degrees,with a real feel of 110 degrees.  As a triathlete, and coach for USAT, we have t coach on the heat as much as we do on technique, and we have to deal with CORE temperatures going to 104  - 105 for competition.  Acclimization obviously is a big factor on adaptability, but it also helps if one learns to use wind variations to help the cooling process.   Even water temperatures in the summer, in open water, will hit 88 - 90 degrees, and has been seen as high as 94 degrees.   One may ask, if the water is that hot how can you swim in it.  Short distances, but not long ones as it will cool the 98.6 temperature.  Great class!"

"As a swimmer, I can relate. Although, I feel that it is directly related to the water temp. I went swimming in a public pool where the water temp was 85.

This never happens when I swim at my lap pool where the temp is 65."

"I've swum quite a bit in Florida's warm waters and find that hydration is as important in swimming as it is in running. You do not think you are perspiring but the weight loss at the end of the race is just the same in water as it is on land. And a final point, just because you are in water does not mean you will not get sunburned. Lots of hydration, lots of sun protection. In short, the same rules and common sense on land as in water."

I am glad to hear that I am not the only one who has this problem.  I tend to soak in a cool lake up to slightly above my knees after a run or a hike.  Ten minutes in the cool water helps to pull down the swelling and to cool down the knees which tend to take the most abuse.  It's become a part of my cool downs after a run.

"Hi! My name is Edward, I'm from Moscow"
I like your comment.  I feel better swimming in cooler water than in warmer water.  I have done both in types during a triathlon and it feel so tired when swimming in warmer water.  I love the cooler water swims.  They make me faster.
I like to use clothing that fits closer to my body on warmer days.  I feel that the wicking material pulls the sweat away from my body better and faster than looser clothing. I have seem sun sleeves used by some athletes in the summer to keep the sun off their arms and to wick away moisture faster.  I use arm and leg warmers on cooler days so this same idea makes sense for hot days.
"*after an hour and fifteen of  singles tennis on a hot day,  why  do I feel even hotter just after I stop."
"I can appreciate the difference as well.  The humidity in Texas makes it much hotter in the summer, and conversely, much colder in the winter.  When in Utah, with the dry climate, it is actually very comfortable at 50-60 degrees.  During the summer the sun can be very intense, but as you suggested, shade in a dry climate is much more valuable.  Another interesting aspect is when running in Texas, one sweats profusely to keep cool (evaporation) but not as much in in a cooler dry environment."
"Texas is awfully big!  What part are you in?  I am in Fort Worth and I think it's very dry, compared to growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, which has humidity similar to Houston.  A friend of mine from El Paso thinks Fort Worth is terribly humid!"

During the competitive season in Texas we trained in hot and humid conditions then travel up North to compete and would do fine but returning back to Texas to the heat was very difficult.  Our bodies would have to adjust back to the heat and it would take a few  days.

According to the modules wouldn't this just decrease their core temperature and increase the path to hypothermia. I guess they could train their body to react differently but I wander if this would just increase the drop of their core temperature?
I would think it replenishes the glycogen stores for quick energy in the muscles.

"When it is cold, my mother loves electric blankets (either to pre-heat her bed, or to keep her lap warm) and she also uses a small space heater under her desk. I think that an elderly person is more likely to sustain injury if feeling very cold and stiff, and then suddenly standing up and beginning to engage in exercise like brisk walking. If one is a bit warmer to begin with, then one can immediately begin a brisk walk or other exercise, hopefully with less chance of injury. When one is very cold, one cannot feel the extremities well."

Agreed. I like a balance of Potassium vs sugar vs sodium. It's tough to find the balance and it works differently depending on how much rest/sleep and my nutrition overall for that day or week.
Could it be there is more than one correct answer and you have only checked one of them?  ;)
It provides glucose which is readily to be used as fuel to generate more energy (ATP) at cell level (cell respiration).
Salt (Natrium) replenish the mineral lost in sweat. 
"Other than losing water from the body and thinking that it's calories, the plastic will keep the sweat from evaporating. Since this will keep the body from losing heat, the person will sweat more and cardiovascular drift will occur sooner. That is a very dangerous idea."

Hello All!
"About 10 years ago, I began an experiment for HIIT by nose breathing which required an intense focus on deep abdominal breaths rather than panting which is generally 'chest-centered' breaths. This allowed me to increase my periods of high intensity work load and my heart rate to 230. I alternated these with 1-2 minute lower intensity 180 heart rate. Even though I sweated profusely, my skin remained cool. I made sure to drink lots of water. Although trainers cautioned that my heart rate was dangerously high, my body did not feel stressed, and the only consequence was my age 50 EKG showed \ abnormal bradycardia\"". The post-exercise euphoria was more intense with this practice."
"Ol¨¢,"
this is an interesting addition to what I always thought was a major component of long-term cardiac drift- actual blood plasma volume loss through sweating. Cardiac drift during extreme heat exposure like corey experienced seemed to affect drift much faster than one would experience during reasonable exercise heat and gradual loss of plasma volume.

"Different individuals have different sweating rates.  I got to see some folks torture themselves in the Gatorade sweat tank -- a stationary cycle in a small sweat box so they could see how much you sweat and the composition of your sweat, such as how much salt you sweat out.  You may just be very efficient in your sweating or other means of getting rid of the extra heat.  It's a good thing, because that means you're probably less likely to suffer the negative consequences of dehydration."

"Ya, I also learned that taking hot shower on hot days and cold shower on cold days your body helps you keep cool/warm.  When you take hot shower on hot days your body wants to keep it cool so they generate cool temp in the body and during the cold temp taking cold shower helps your body generate heat because it understands your body's temp decreasing thus, tries to increase your body temp."

If it matters to someone tracking this kind of thing, I am using Windows 8.1 on MS Surface Pro."
"Not a scientific answer, but I think it has something to do with iron being need to carry oxygen in the blood.  Seems reasonable that if you are not pumping enough oxygen due to low iron levels, you cannot regulate body heat efficiently."
I wondered about that too.  May have to do with increasing your surface area?
"Early in the getting cold module, Dr. Friedlander talked about both local and central control over vasodilation and constriction. Whenthe core temp rises high enough, a central response dilating the AVA will override local signals for constriction to dissapate heat. Cross country skiing is a demanding sport with high exertion levels. What you experienced is the effect of vasodilation and shunting of blood to the palms to help cool the core."
I used to download video and watch them latter. I do not have proper internet connection at home. So I use office computer to download teaching materials. Could you please provide an option to download videos.
I am also looking forward to this class. I am a Econ major at Cal state Fullerton so this class will come in handy later in my studies. I was especially attracted to the part about predicting market behaviors.
"The AVA's and venous plexus areprimarily located under the palm surface.  If you examine the palm, you can see the red dappling that is the high concentration of these structures. If you look at the back of the hand, you see larger vessels without the benefit of the dense bed of plexus.  There is some added benefit to whole hand imersion. But Grahn and Heller have shown there is a significant benefit to heat transfer when the vacuum is added in most situations."

"Altitude is something the body adjusts to either by speeding up or slowing down heart rates in order to get more oxygen circulating. Higher altitude in the heat, combined with low humidity makes heat more tolerable, or so it seems. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it!

After 17 years of high altitude living, moving to sea level took my body 6 months to acclimate and stop swelling, go figure."

"Hi! My name is Dave and I currently live in Palm Springs. I retried from 30+ years as an EE/Systems Engineer working on displays for fighter pilots. Living with chronic fatigue, I am relearning my body so I can train for and run marathons again. Understanding the boundaries and limits of my body are as important now as they were before: by going out & doing, I hope to encourage my family and others to find their own limits as well."
cool
Thanks :)
I do not think that's the case. In wikipedia $y$ is just some function. Here we think of $y$ more precisely - $y$ is a function (a sum actually) of some other function ($f(x)$) and independent random variable ($epsilon$).

"During my summer holidays we had yoga sessions at the beach in Greece. During that week the temperatures were at 40 degrees and with the humidity at 60% was making the lesson even harder. Although, every partisipant of the class was happy with their performance and they said that they managed to do exercises that they couldn't do the previous sessions. Our yoga instructor told us that it was due to the heat!"

Hi all!
Thank you BabolatGirl for sharing these two videos.  They provided the info on how Avacore works.  Avacore apparently can replace performance enhancing drugs in reaching the athlete's maximum athletic capacity.
black absorbs vs. white reflects
I believe the controversy is more related to the approach to warming and cooling. For decadesnresearchers have focused on general surface cooling and heating. To be effective surface cooling and or heating takes a lot of energy. AVAcore's research showed significant core temperature changes and performance gains for with relatively small energy input or extraction.
"Maxed out the volume, tried different browsers.  Still no luck.  Fortunately the text of the lecture is provided so I am reading that, but it would be nice to get the audio.  I can hear the lectures on YouTube, but they are not all there."
"Thanks, smgross. I didn't even notice the page numbers on the slides."
"A warm footbath is great, too. Warms the whole body up. The presence of venous anastamoses in the hands and feet makes this make sense academically, finally. I always knew about keeping your brain warm by wearing a hat, keeping your core warm so you don't need to vasoconstrict the periphery, but I never understood why having warm hands and feet does seem to warm your whole body up. Even without the pressure differential in the Avacore devices, which should only increase that effect. "
Final answer is counted.
"Hats (\^\"") are generally used to represent fitted values.  For example, $hat{f}(x)$ is our fitted regression function (as opposed to the true regression function $f(x)$)."""
"I've experienced cold shock in the Arctic Ocean - I dunked in to get that coveted \Polar Bear Club\"" membership, and was surprised by my body's reaction - gasping for air, holding my heart feeling like I was going to have a heart attack for a moment - it was intense! I was in shallow water so it was quick to get out, and the 40¡ã breeze felt warm by comparison. "
"I thought it was psychological - like when I have to pee when I see and/or hear water running. The increased pressure in the core causes the peeing - amazing! I'll have to try a bit harder to keep my feet, hands and head warmer in the future if for no other reason than to keep from having to pee so often."
"What's up Corey, Anne and the EP101 team! My name is Alex <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I live in Los Angeles, CA.

I'm running in my first marathon this March and thought it would be cool to get some deeper insight into what my body is going through as I run. I'm a strong believer that gaining experiential knowledge is the only way really learn something well. Thanks you all for putting this course together. The videos and questions are a lot of fun. I actually feel things clicking in my mind! :)"
"I live in a warmer climate(California) and I travel to colder areas to enjoy snow sports often, I find that my cardiovascular response to the elevation keeps me warmer even when sleeping(and increased breathing for oxygen delivery) and the cold doesn't seem to impact me. Moving to California from Colorado was easier than going back to Colorado to visit- once \un-acclimated\"" to cold it is never comfortable. Any idea how long it takes to develop the acclimation? a month? 6 months?"""
"I enjoyed the expert interview with Jill Homer, the cold weather adventure racer, and had to check out the Susitna 100 - their \Race Conditions\"" page is great, good \""supplementary reading\"" for the Cold section of this course!"
I can not open the R sessions chapters. Is anyone else having this problem?
"Hi, all! <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> here. I received emails about this terrific online class from both Stanford and Branson.  I attended Stanford undergrad (ages ago) and my daughter currently attends Branson (a high school in Marin County, California). Apparently, both Stanford and Branson are promoting this class to their students, alum, and parents. This is my first online class and I'm loving it. The videos, quizzes, and variety of teaching methods are delightfully engaging. The interviews transform the course material into something truly dynamic and memorable. After hearing the interview, reading the course information makes so much more sense -- it's like having the coursework put into a real life context before I even start the learning process. I love being able to pause the video while I digest what has just been said (or look up a new word), and I love the closed captions on the side which aid in my understanding and help me to anticipate what might be said next. Well done, all around! This is a terrific class."
I am really excited about the course.
Mine are opening just fine. You do need R installed on your system for these to open up though (these are code documents...)
"Agreed. This question should be changed to reflect the fact that you should \check all that apply\"", like all of the other questions for which there are multiple answers."""
I would think that in general variance is worse for inference simply because more bias and less variance usually means a simpler model.  For prediction you'd probably want as much variance as still yields good results on the test data.

Hi !
"Hi,"
"Hola todos,"
Thank you. Looking forward to fortifying old learning and learning anew.
I've posted an announcement in the Google Group regarding tomorrow's meetup:
"I am a runner.  I ran my first and only marathon a few years ago. It was in early October so long runs were in the hot summer.  I could have used the knowledge of  the heat modules back then.  I have not competed in a running race since that marathon.  My husband on the other hand, runs one very year for the  past 8 years. How's your training coming? Training alone or with people?"
What are the specific numbers outside of the normal H and H ranges when performance appears to be impacted?
Came across this:
"It's said to be cooled with cool water and not cold water. That makes a big difference. Nevertheless, I like your approach."
"Wow! That's amazing. It's a concept I often share with others though. Our bodies are extremely amazing and sometimes we underestimate them because we are afraid of death and other complications. However, if our body is put to the test, it's very likely that it will win."
"I'm a physiotherapist living in tasmania, australia which is a temperate climate but pretty cold (by my standards) in winter (average temp 0-10 degrees C), with antarctic winds which are very cold."
I am in NE Denver and would like to meet with others to study.
"Thank you for the course. I'm taking it because it's interesting, and maybe I'll find ways to use it later. Last year, I downloaded and started reading ESL, but while I could conceptually understand the presentation, I could not do the exercises. Most of the math was too advanced for me as I've tried to learn math on my own as a hobby. With lectures and a forum and the new ISL, I hope it will be enough for me keep up with this class, and I look forward to the challenge."
"Hello Professors and TA's,"
"Yes, I am in Highlands Ranch"
"I think that is what happened. In the first week, it had a note to \choose all that apply.\""  This week, some did and some didn't. I have to be more careful in the future. Thanks for responding."""
I've always wondered about doing yoga in a 110 degree room and if it was really good for you to do something like that. Does it increase risk for injury?
I am a midwife and my understanding of the research is that the risk of NTD is associated with more prolonged elevated core temp such as with a fever with the flu. This risk only applies to the first 4 weeks after conception[ 6 weeks from last period] as this is the time during which the neural tube forms and closes. So if you have a fever early in pregnancy try to bring your temp down with Tylenol and cool showers. Avoid hot tubs and sauna during the 1st 6 weeks too and limit them to 10 minutes the rest of pregnancy. In a sauna and steam rooms the core temp will rise faster as you are in much hotter ambient temp and steam room has high humidity[for real!] which makes heat dissipation more challenging.

"I'm certainly not an elite or marathon runner. The best I've ever done is a mile run at 6:50. But it sounds to me like gatorade, which has no practical use during a mile run at 6:50, has enough electrolytes and salts to retain an appropriate balance for a marathon run."
"Maybe it's because you stop moving around, so there is less convective cooling and/or suddenly you are not thinking about the game anymore, so you can think about how hot you really feel!"
"And also lots of other professionals such as road constriction, etc.. Don't forget to include those in your solute as well"

I run marathons and am completely agree with the later comment. One can't outdo himself on the part of the race because the last part is usually the hardest one regardless the weather or temperature.
Hi. <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Chennai.
"The data sets are available on the book site, along with PDFs of the charts [ http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html ], but I don't see any code. It shouldn't be too difficult to recreate the figures. Have you used R before?"
"Great lesson on physiological cold response from the body.  I live in Southern California, but recently attended a football game in Green Bay, Wisconsin during the \polar vortex\"" about two weeks ago.  I was amazed at the reactions I had to even temporary exposure, while the wind chill drove the temperatures down to -35 F."""
"Hello to all,"
"Interesting that you ask Karl. DrF is quite involved in learning about how to become a better teacher, and has conducted (and is conducting) research at Stanford asking related questions. One such study compared students in her physiology course at Stanford in two conditions 1) receiving traditional video lecture 2) receiving story based lecture. We have received all the data for that particular study and will be looking forward to the results. Examples of some outcome measures we are looking at are performance, engagement, and subjective enjoyment as reported by the student."
" TWillard, it would be an honor to be able to play a role in getting your students excited about learning and the human body. Lets chat. Please send contact to <emailRedac> ."
"Hello to all,"
"I'd consider myself a \cold\"" person, too. It would be interesting to learn what causes me to feel cold all the time, including as I type this!"""
"I think it should be fine, remember it is mean of the squared errors, I am also getting something along these lines."
"I have the same problem, too."
"Thanks Julzybear, I wonder whether it is due to muscular/tendon contractions and therefore loss of flexibility and accompanied reduction of space between joints that limits movement therefore makes it painful especially when the joints are compromised by injury or medical conditions such as arthritis?? Not sure how to put it technically. I would expect that given the anecdotal evidence this would have been researched extensively?"
maybe even blood constriction plays a role there
Thank you.
"Prof Frielander's story about being told to run her hands under the water fountain reminds me of reading somewhere that if you're too hot you can cool yourself down by running cool water over your wrists.  The idea was to cool the blood in the vein near the surface. But your hands obviously have all those tiny blood vessels.  I wonder if there's any research about which is more effective - running cool water over hands, or over wrists?"
"Hi,"
Dear staff
Thanks for bringing all these stuff together in a user-friendly course! It seems that we're gonna have fun with statistics all over the World :)
"Water cools people down twice as fast than the air does, then why still so many people go swimming in winter?"

"By the way, notice that cheeks are getting red not only in cold. "
"I live in Indonesia. Here, we only have 2 season, its dry and rainy season. Due to this global heating, we who live in Jakarta, usually got 40-45C in the afternoon, but many of us are still doing exercise in the middle of this heat season. As what I've learned from the local newspaper, I've red a lot of people that got stroke in the middle of their exercise. I didn't understand why are those people, who exercise regularly, can get a heart attack? This lesson surely made me understand, why those kind of things can be happen."
Dear StatLearners
I was told wrists too. My logic works like this - the skin of the palms is generally 'tougher' than that over the vessels in the wrists making temperature (cold) transfer more effective at the wrist. 
i couldn't agree more
"Hi everyone, my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and i am from Argentina; I am a psychiatrist. My interest in the subject is as much professional as it is personal since i've always loved sports and the outdoors."
Thanks for this great course and ISL book! It'll be useful to flourish our statistical learning knowledge with applications. Also I'm hoping that you will offer an advanced course based on ESL soon.
I would appreciate it as well. So I could watch the videos during my train rides.
"Thank you.  Now I see that the 'next' button, which looks like a right-pointing triangle below the video, is enabled and takes you to the quiz as well."
Brilliant explanation!

"Ah! When I first read this question, I thought \how am I ever going to figure this out\""... but as soon as I read your hint, it clicked. Thank you!"""
Simple and beautifully explained. Thanks. Got it right on the first try because of you.
"I am aware of an increase in blood volume for those who train/exercise regularly; but is there an even further increase in blood volume for those who regularly train in hot environments? It would make sense that it would, to help offset the drop in blood volume, but is there any actual data in support of this."
Good question.  Same issue.  And in my experience I don't think I was dehydrated when they kicked in.
"In Florida, during longer runs (9 - 12 miles) in the summer, I lose consistently 7 - 9 pounds of water weight.   For every 1 - 3% dehydration, an athlete will lose 5 - 15% energy.   However, if training is ongoing, the body will acclimate to this water lost, though it may take 2 - 3 days to regain the water weight lost.  Also, as a coach, if after a long run like that, one can lose the weight, drink two bottles of water immediately and \falsify\"" the indication that hydration has been restored, as the urine will now be clear.  Thus, the need to know how to drink more slowly allowing the absorption rate to do what it is intended, especially for endurance athletes."""
"An athlete has a greater capacity for  heat storage  before fatigue and sweat rate is lower  i think when an athlete is in the  open atmosphere running they have on garment but thin one with a short pants , while they running they would feels the heat of the atmosphere and also have a small amount of air brushing their body and i think that is one reason the athlete won't sweat that much and feels the heat."
"I donate blood as often as possible because I know it helps someone somewhere. Unfortunately I always pass out right after doing so. Can someone explain to me why when passing out we feel extreme hot and cold sensation accompanied with sweating and why nurses place cold compresses/water in the locations they do (on the chest and back of neck, etc.)?"
Thanks guys! I am a big fan of hiking but I have the same sausage finger syndrome. Fortunately I can try out your idea because I got poles for xmas! Happy trails ya'll.
Any news on this yet. Would like to print them all out at work.
We're told that training in heat causes a person to be acclimatized faster in heat than in normal (whatever that is) temperatures.  Why?  Thanks!
"Hi, my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>. I am taking this class just for fun as it looked interesting and something I would enjoy learning more about. I am a recently retired airline pilot that learned to fly in the U.S. Coast Guard, and was based at one time in Kodiak, Ak. In retirement I drive school bus and enjoy my summers boating.  I currently live in the Madison Wisconsin area, and if you've been following the news you know we've had some pretty cold weather lately.  Thus, the very first lesson here about cold really hits home!"
"Yup! I understood that if you wanted to capture 10% of the neighbors of a given data point in a 50 dimension space, you would need to include almost the entire space!"
that is not strange because it is optional and none of the questions are worth any points
Worked for me. What a great tool!
"That's not particularly helpful; the OP wants the `auto` CSV file which comes with the **ISLR** package, not a Windows binary for R."
"You may find some of these definitions in the section titled Cold Glossary, along the left side of the made course page.  (At least I wish I would have knew about that earlier as these terms were being used!)"
Great Explanation!
I am an Ironman triathlete but I have never done a 'solo' marathon. Only half marathons. But as Spa describes above I experienced the same. I am not performing well below 18 degrees and had my best race results around 25 degrees. I managed to beat some usually faster girls in an Ironman race where we had 38 degrees and lots of athletes dropped out but I didn't slow down much at all.
I believe that g(x) is often used to represent one of many theoretical *candidate* functions that we might look at the select a final f(x) that we use for our actual model.
I'm excited about this course - thank you so much to the professors for offering it!
First try.
I also had some problems with the volume.
"The adaptation response. The body adapts quickly to exercise too to optimize energy use. Since a heat response would use energy, it only makes sense that adaptation would happen quickly here as well."
"I have the same or similar problem.  With R open and at the \R Sessions\"" page of the course in my browser, what do I have to do next.  I have found ch2.R in my downloads but opening it with R pulls up the R editor which just sits there."""
"Yes, we see that the focus is poor in the R sessions. Sorry about that. I think they get a bit better in later sessions. The R scripts are available (click on the R Sessions), so that you can have them open alongside as you watch. Even better, if you have a big enough screen, in a separate window run RStudio and execute the same commands from the script as you go along."
Thanks for clearing that one up mayer. (Its great to have so many smart people around answering these questions for us!)
Very interested in learning the application part of these course. Especially that R will be in use. But reading the theoretical part of it is my problem. But i will try
I feel the same way that the body response to cold is different in different places.  
"I'm a long time runner and triathlete who loves running in the cool and suffers badly in the heat. I seem perform best at around 0 to 20C, though as summer progresses I can do ok up to about 30C once acclimatised. Above 30C I slow down a lot, though since I don't get to experience those sorts of temperatures often, I don't get a chance to acclimatise."
On Windows 8.1 (Surface Pro) if that gives anyone any ideas...
Thanks!
"Hi Bhabani,"
"hi Chitraka,"
I'm from Sweden and goes reguarly to the outdoor sauna every winter with following cold bath in the sea for over 25 years now. Usualy we go for three dips in the ice cold water (about 0-7 C or 32-44 F). The sauna is about 90-100C (194-212F). 
"Yes, I agree, the first necessarily leads to the second, nice point. I guess in my training the emphasis was squarely on the first meaning, so when the quiz asked if the addition of parameters to a model could do anything about bias, I thought, \No, of course not!\"" Wrong."""
I agree with you that it is strange!. Black definitely absorbs more heat. Any Bedouins on this course?
It's similar to the sort of technique used by jockeys to get their weight down before a race. The weight loss is through sweat.
"There's a lot of overlap between Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Mining, and even Artificial Intelligence. To some degree, researchers from each of these fields discover some of the same methods and give them different names. We use different vocabulary, but at times talk about the same things. Take a look at Brendan O'Connor's blog, [Statistics vs. Machine Learning, Fight!][1], for a few more equivalent glossary terms from the two fields."
"Feel free to use any software you want, with the caveat that the course is designed to teach you R and that is the only language we will support."
"Just a minor nit-pick:  Prof Hastie would not refer to a model as being \qualitative,\"" only variables.  The dichotomy being drawn is that the variable can represent a number (quantitative, as in height), or a grouping (qualitative, such as color or binned height)."""
"Throughout the course, if we discuss the variance of a model we mean the variance of the fits.  This is consistent with the variance mentioned in the bias-variance tradeoff."
"Think about what it would mean if the point was in the boundary \for all j.\""  This is not the boundary being described by the problem, but would rather correspond to something like the corners of the hypercube."""
I see now.  Thanks.

"Thanks for the pole tip. I too, get the sausage fingers when hiking in the heat."
"The higher efficiency may have to do with lower sweat rates in females, that is, the same rate of evaporation can be achieved for a lower sweat rate (see Gagnon & Kenny J Appl Physiol. 2012. 113(5):746-57). This might be due to peripheral effects like lower sweat gland sensitivity to acetylcholine (see Gagnon et al. 2013. J Appl Physiol. 114(3):394-401) rather than hormones, which are associated with changes in the sweating onset threshold, or surface area/volume."
"Perhaps you have sufficient water intake, but not enough magnesium, potassium or calcium?"
"Even when males and females are matched for surface area/volume, females show lower whole-body sweating sensitivity (Gagnon & Kenny. J Physiol. 2011. 589(Pt 24):6205-17)."
"The videos are on youtube. WIthout revealing too much, it shouldn;t be difficult to get the video url and download youtube videos."
"Is it possible to get answer sheets for the book exercises each week, for those of us who want to practice more(especially in R)? "
"I see that the interview is with Ken Zemach who competed in the Badwater.  I live in Tucson and Pam Reed, also from Tucson, won that race some years ago. She is a tiny woman! Given the hot dry climate I can imagine the ONLY way to cool is through evaporation. I don't know how anyone can drink enough to stay conscious over 135 miles, particularly through Death Valley. I hike in Tucson in the summer and it's challenging to stay hydrated."
Thanx for the link to the article!
This may be related to training adaptations for performance gain.  
"Hi y'all! The way I see it, your body adapts to training by increasing plasma volume and sweat ability. Your body also adapts to heat by increasing plasma volume and sweat ability. If you train in heat, your body basically has to adapt to a greater stress (training + heat)."
I *love* that blog post! Thanks so much for the link. My brother and I have been having this debate for years.
"In the video, it briefly mentions the effects of drugs that target dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, with regard to hyperthermia. Would this include anti-depressants? I take Effexor, an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitor) drug, and one of the side effects I have trouble with is night sweats. Regardless of the temperature of my room, what clothing I sleep in, or the number of blankets, I wake up very often drenched in \cold\"" sweats. Sometimes it's my whole body, other times it's just my knees/thighs (odd spot to sweat so much that there's wet spots on the sheets). I've just had to get used to it but it's such a nuisance to wake up to."""
"Sali, the evaporative process happens regardless of the temperature of the water being used. Sweat certainly doesn't come out cool but it sure makes us feel cooler. Ice water might be refreshing to one person but shocking to the next. Personally, I prefer cool to room temp with an occasional ice cube rub when needed."
Hi everyone! I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Canada. I'm a masters student in Kinesiology and so I definitely have an interest in this material. I just came back from climbing Mount Kinabalu and would love to learn more about the adaptations to altitude I experienced during and following the climb.

There have been multiple queries about this. Short answer No. Someone has started to compile answers.
"I often hike on hot summer days wearing a white hat, white long sleeve shirt, white socks and shoesÿ with as much made from cotton as possible. This is very helpful because the cotton holds sweat for extra evaporative cooling, the white color reflects the radiant heat, and has the added benefit of keeping insects away (dark colorsÿ including dark hair will attract mosquitos and flies). Of course, an old wool pullover tied around my waist or stuffed in my daypack is added insurance in case of a sudden drop in temperature and a summer thunderstorm. One little trick with the hatÿ soak it in a stream or with a little water from your drinking water and it will add to your evaporative cooling. A bandana works well for this too."
cool
Thanks. It was really a useful information :)

Tricky question!
Both happens due to cold. Does physiological ray aids phenomenon occur. And who are more prone to it ?
I try to figure this out
"In my case, my hands and feet are always cold, but the rest of my body keeps warm. My sister says that I radiate heat and when she's cold she always comes to hug me, haha. But having the hands and feet cold is really annoying."

Hi Bhabani
"I'm taking this course too now.  He moves fast and assumes a lot so its good stuff, but not for the uninitiated.  Actually, taking both these courses together is a great bit of luck.  This course is far better in that there is a textbook, many more video's and more statistical concepts which is missing from Peng's course.  Peng assumes from the pace you've been using R before."

"I find it interesting that most people seem more able to adapt to heat than cold while exercising. I'm from Alberta, Canada and find that I can handle exercise in the cold far better than in the heat. I do most exercising outdoors, year round. Granted, it seems to be humidity that bothers me most, but I'm curious of the extent to which perceived adaptability affects one's ability to adapt. Or even the effect of experience (i.e. growing up in the heat v cold) on adaptability."

"Your heat threshold adjusts as you are in warmer temps.  We keep our home around 78-80 degrees and we do not sweat or feel warm in this temp.  However, when people come to visit who routinely keep their homes at 72 degrees, well, I have to crank my thermostat down to accommodate them.  This shows me that our bodies adjust quickly to heat."

My husband is one of those people who handles heat and humidity very well.  We were in 7 degrees North Latitude (Costa Rica) at the beach (sea level) in August.  He was very happy in heavy dungarees and a long-sleeved shirt; I was miserable (I can't handle heat and humidity).  Working in the heat is something that's meaningless to him.
"It was interesting hearing the mentions of cold water shock, here in the UK we have rather chilly seas which we play in so cold water shock is something we have to learn all about when doing marine first aid training. Cold water is classed as anything below 15  centigrade (59f) in this context, the year round average sea temperature here is 12 centigrade (54f)! Currently most of our coastal waters are well below that http://www.thebeachguide.co.uk/sea-temperature"

"So many of the women's heath issues are so deeply rooted in their culture. Acceptance of domestic violence, lack of status, genital cutting, depression and arranged early marriage are all so prolific that it is 'normal' in their world. That is why human rights, including women's health education is so very important in the quest to change these practices. The grassroots efforts and women's groups that are growing around the world, focused on teaching human rights and instilling worth to women are imperative to the effort to empower women to want and demand change. My mind is abuzz with all of the information I just read about. I am so excited to get started with this course. There is so much to learn and so much to do."
"I have used sun sleeves during Ironman events and find them very helpful in keeping my body temperature down as well as preventing sun burn. It seemed that keeping them wet with cool water was most effective. The wind ads another level of heat dissipation with a wet sleeve. In theory, the fabric wicks moisture from the skin to the surface of the fabric then evaporative cooling keeps the sleeve at a lower temperature. A white fabric does not absorb as much of the sun's heat than your arm alone also providing a cooler surface. I wonder if a warm wet sleeve will inhibit the peripheral cooling of the covered area."
"In some countries or where I come from, not only culture causes hindrance to access to women's health but religion is sometimes the barrier. For instance, Reproductive Health, I believe that RH is a vital information to every women but then religion is hindering, making it a bad thing. That's why learning about International Women's Health and Rights is very important."
"Use the k-nearest neighbor as an example, the model will be very flexible if you choose a very small N.

"I remember when I first moved to Southern Georgia from Japan in June, it was so much hotter than I was accustomed to and I was profusely sweating for the first few weeks (it has been so many years ago that I don't remember exactly how long). I was first wearing socks and sneakers, and remember it was quite uncomfortable because my feet got soaking wet. Soon I started wearing sandals...but then later on I realized my body was no longer sweating as uncomfortably as I first thought. That was very unique experience in my life and that's how I remember about it."
"Though I am acutely aware of the fact that an unfathomable number of women in this world live in great peril, it is still quite shocking to see how a lot of countries view the mistreatment of women as nothing out of the ordinary. Very disheartening, indeed, to be informed that the road to female empowerment and full equality is long ahead of us; how the exact opposite of those things are so deeply instilled in the heart and mind of people across various parts of the world. "
"Great information.  In my 4-times a week spinning class there is always a conflict between those of us that want it cooler (with lots of fans blowing) and those that want it warmer (and keep their warm up jackets on the entire class).   I'm leaving for a class in 10 minutes, I am going to take the suggestion of the cool wet sponges with me and instead of using it on my legs, try it on my hands, face and arm pits where, based on the info I've learned in these modules, the capillary network is greater and see if this cools me down and allows for improved performance (measured by calorie count or miles).   <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
"Similarly, in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, the majority of the population have very severe mental health issues, due to the trauma of ongoing occupation and periods of political violence.  For women, this is compounded by patriarchal structures that promote discrimination against women and, in some instances, condone gender based violence.  Meanwhile, many men are affected by the pressure to provide for the family and the inability to do so because of the lack of opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship.  I think both sexes have mental health issues that are caused by the gender roles and expectations of their society, which can have different, harmful consequences for the two sexes."

"Different people need different levels of insulation as will the same person at different levels of activity! If you are total beginners at skiing there will be a lot of standing around and not much activity at least for the first day or two while you all find your feet. For that you will need to wrap up warm and I'd suggest wearing a helmet rather the a woolly hat!. If you are wearing a helmet that will keep you warm enough most of the time, if you get cold add a thin beanie hat under the helmet. A buff round your neck is a good idea as well, makes a handy mask while you are sat on the cold cold chair lift!"

Women the world over face horrific circumstances and have been taught that it is their lot in life, which I feel only adds to the tragedy. But what has shocked me recently, is that even where I live (in the US) among my classmates and peers, people don't want to talk about women. Women that I work with don't want to have the conversation because we have been taught to be silent. I can't even begin to list the reasons that men don't want to approach the subject. I am happy to see that course breaks that silence and faces the harsh reality head on."

"I liked this chapter. I believe we need to empower and educate women more. We definitely are essential to human life as we bring life to the world. Men often abuse this. I wish contraception could be available to impoverished women, but would that help if they have abusive and manipulative husbands? Men need to be reminded why women are so important. Women need to be reminded of their basic human rights. This high school girl who had only been living in the US for a short time had disposed her 7 month gestational aged baby in a trash can at a local high school by me. She was from Haiti. Do you think, despite all the resources available to her at the high school and in our city in general, that her deep rooted helplessness and ignorance of her basic human rights and special care as a woman impeded her from making a better decision? Women need to be educated and reminded of their rights. Basic human rights. Women's rights = human rights -- men need to understand that and shed that understanding onto the women in their home, city, state, nation, country, etc. Why focus on women? Well, we underestimate and second guess our rights as humans. I don't know why, but I'd like to find out through the course of this book study and discussion."

"Hello fellow students!  Have you noticed that when you first get in cold water, it definitely feels cold, but after a few minutes, it can start to feel warm?  Especially relative to the air temperature?  I particularly remember swimming in the ocean in the summer in New England:  First I was hot standing on the beach, so I went in the cold water.  It was difficult to submerge myself, but once I had been in for about 10 minutes, the water felt warm.  When I got out, suddenly the ambient air felt terribly cold and I just wanted to get back in the water.  What is the physiological mechanism at work there?"

I think that is a very important point. What is truly a religious teaching vs what people do in the name of a religion may be very different. As a Muslim woman this point is very important to me. There are many misunderstandings of the religion that have a negative impact on the wellbeing of women. These are cultural practices not found in an educated view of the religion.

Those who did speak about liberation of and equality for women were laughed at back then (called \women's libbers\""). Even now in the U.S. the term \""feminist\"" is made fun of by some people.

I couldn't remember what it was called when it is preferred to have boys...just reread --The son preference. Just incase you all were wondering :)
On Windows you need to include the file extension to open the file.
"To add to your great point that son preference is prevalent in America today- my father had three girls and then remarried and had 3 boys (and 4 more girls). He refers to his oldest son as the \crown-prince\"" and the only thing he ever called my sisters and me were: \""furlough, recall, and strike\"". Also, his side of the family always encouraged me to have 'lots of beautiful babies'. Luckily, I was raised from age 14 on mostly by my mother. But I still envy the 100% supportive dads that some of my friends have."
The volume of a cube is (side length)^dimension.  In this question we're asked to find the volume of a region that is left over when you subtract one cube from another.  So find the volume of the two cubes and subtract.

"Years ago, while traveling in Italy in the heat of a Mediterranean summer, someone told me to put cool water on the back of my neck to cool off. It worked! Now I understand that even running cool water over my hands or exposing my skin to cool water will have that same effect. Good advice when traveling in places that don't have a/c or easy ways to cool down."

"The first chapter really did, as so many who've commented below, open my eyes. The impact of women on the world is hampered every day by differential access to the rights enumerated by the convention(s). The most shocking thing for me (though one thing amongst many including literacy levels and access to trained professionals during labour) is the power men have over women's *access* to healthcare. That and the short discussion about agency - how women have always been actors but were denied their history and the chance to interpret until recently really engaged me as did the paradigms of either/or vs. both/and and the societal values put on statements such as \it's a girl\"" vs. \""it's a boy\"". I'm lucky to live in a personal world where the former statement is not as much of a determinant and brings joy and expectation but this chapter was a useful reminder that so many others are not so lucky."""

"I likened the web-click scenario to the Netflix example. The web site operators ought to have some data collected from existing users, which can form the same sort of sparse matrix described in the Netflix challenge. The goal must be to predict what sort of behavior is exhibited by users most likely to click some button."
Thanks <redacted><redacted> for your reflection and for a new word - I hadn't heard of the term femonationalism before. I struggle with this component as well and try to stay in dialogue about how to ensure that getting involved in the work is not from a savior complex. I also agree that the feminist movement has really left out many communities. I have been lately enjoying reading more about Third-Wave Feminist movement which attempts to consider how race and class specifically (but I believe is expanding to LGBTIQ identities) must be interwoven into discussions about equity and equality.
"Hello . I am a family planning nurse with nearly 30 years experience  and very interested in the fact that few consider how the advances in women's health over the 2Oth century has improved their lives. It should be  relatively simple to improve the lives of very disadvantaged women by applying some of the knowledge we have about this but religion and politics, stigma and tradition create barriers.I am interested in breaking down these barriers through education to change the predominant discourse about women."

I like to attend bikram yoga classes every other month to help with stretching. I run a lot especially long distance. In hindsight I can see why it was difficult for me to hold the standing head to knee pose. I can do it without a problem but in the heated room I struggle big time. Are there any adverse effects? I don't do it often but like I said I like to throw it in there when training for my marathon. Running the BK half in NYC this year this section is very helpful. Thank God for the water stations I toss a cup directly on my head to cool me down.
Travel well intituitivo.Thank you!
The U.N. declaration of Human Rights  was adopted in 1948 and could really use updating...families are no longer seen as the only group unit in society although I would say that many still consider it to have preeminence in social standing.
"The reservations are fascinating - particularly (for me) regarding pensions and social security and that discriminatory contract clauses are void but don't void whole documents. Also there are points on religious denominations and orders, adoption, combat effectiveness and issues of succession e.g. monarchy and inheritance of titles (though that's now changing in law). Reservations are clearly used to reassert sovereignty even where no objections to the substance."
Thanks for posting this link!
"Despite knowing that women in less developed areas were discriminated against and less likely to have their daily needs met, it was still sobering to see the true scope of the issue as displayed in the table of statistics and described in the introduction. Regardless, this having already taught me how little I truly know, I am very excited to begin this course fully and increase my understanding of the position of women throughout the world as well as learning, hopefully, how I can contribute to their futures. "
"Thanks, smgross. I guess the MOOC isn't quite there yet on homework. It's good to know that I shouldn't wait for more R exercises to come up in the course."

"I think R is more comprehensive than Octave. Octave has matrices of numbers, but R can do a lot with different data types in its data frames. They can be strings for categories, or use date-times for indexing. R can be like working with tables from a database, where you can select entries based on criteria. R data frames can have column names, and has string features like grep. Does Octave have features like these? I've worked with Octave only a little."

"Hi Rito,"
"Women have always been excluded in the society. When the global sector is emphasized on the issues and problems, women issue and development came to be weaken and consider at the second place to think about it. However, women are the one who have targeted for illness, disease and poor conditions even in the better society. Human Rights sometimes missed out the issues of sexual and reproductive rights as human rights. After reading Chapter 1, i have gained some ideas in which women role is higher to be related to global issues. Women issues are not personal issues;whereas, these issues can challenge the world. Therefore, the more education you get, the more chance to change the world view on women."
"I am a Certified Nurse Midwife from the US living in Costa Rica. I have a small homebirth practice and am active in the (oh so slow) movement to humanize birth. Maternal and infant health is the lens through which I have viewed these issues. The way birth is practiced in most developed (including the US & Europe) and lesser developed countries is possible only because violence against women has been normalized and institutionalized! Reading the Data Sheet was just plain depressing because I have been an aficionado of such statistics for a long time. As a 70s feminist, I truly believed that the world would be a better place for women by now. I hope this class broadens my perspective and gives me ideas, inspiration and tools for moving forward."

"As discussed in the first chapter too ofter women have been as the proxi of someone else, daughter of / sister of / wife of / mother of. when 30% of households are headed by women, it is of the utmost importance that voices are raised to recognize the leadership role women play."
"I look forward to reading more of Anne Firth Murray's book which explores the challenges women and girls face globally from birth to aging and also profiles some of the hopeful solutions and responses she has encountered in her travels and her work with the Global Fund for Women.  As I reviewed the statistics about women's health, abuse, and opportunities, I was overcome with grief and sadness particularly in terms of how women in some parts of the world view themselves and their rights and place in the world."
"I¡¯m grateful for the opportunity to take part in a course that focuses on such an important, but often overlooked topic.  I have just returned to New Zealand after living and working in Papua New Guinea for more than two years.  I¡¯ve seen firsthand how often women are treated like second class citizens and worse and yet I was often inspired by the tenacity of such women to continue to make the best out of very difficult situations.  "

Yes! violence against women has been normalized...and the scary thing is that it seem to be the women that unwittingly perpetuate the culture.  More awareness building have produced some anger that now needs to be channeled in such a way that both men and women are empowered to make positive change. I believe the human rights lens is the lens we should use to highlight change (I was abut to say capture the change....violence)

The content of the course is well thought through as per today's times. Both of you have set the bar pretty high for MOOC courses for other  professors. Kudos to you for such a brilliant job done for teaching and sharing knowledge across the globe. BIG thank you!!"
?i everyone!I am looking forwrad to start this amazing course!I have attended a master in Women and Gender studies in 2003 but I can't wait to keep up with the latest data around the issue. I was shocked by the data that appeared women to agree with the violence towards themselves under certain circumstances-for example when they disagreed with their husband. That means that injustice has become second skin for these women and is needed a lot of work to be done to make these women feel that they deserve a better life. What else had shocked me when I first came throught it was that women were fond of the rituals of genital cut because that was a step that made them  women officially.
Thank you for your help. Sometimes a good example is what it takes to understand  difficult concepts (for me anyway)!.
What a great opportunity this course is! I look forward to learning with you all on these important topics.
Hi everyone!
"Unfortunately anti abortion movement has taken the road of anti abortion law vs anti abortion education. I believe that a woman would be allowed to make decisions regarding her body and her health, provided of course that she is capable of doing so.  The responsibility of communities is to educate so that the decisions can be informed.  It is a highly disempowering move that these decisions be taken from women in an assumption that we would make poor decisions if allowed to decide for ourselves."
I agree that they are doing great work...We need many more drops in this bucket.
It was very interesting to read this chapter. It was very informative to know the situation of different countries. In Armenia we also have many problems with women's rights issues.

But perhaps not. I'm a disciple of Prof Tim Noakes. Tim argues that humans are well adapted to exercise in the heat and that hyperthermia and not dehydration is the major risk for ex in the heat. He believes that humans can experience significant fluid loss without danger. In recent times the guidelines from scientific bodies such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) have changed to more closely reflect his views.

"Reading the Forward and Prologue really opens your eyes to the gender related issues across the globe and helps you to understand the wide spread issue, understanding that this isn't only happening in our individual places of birth. The very first sentence in the Prologue \Being born female is dangerous to your health. This reality may not be true for many readers, but for most women living in poorer countries around the globe, it is devastating,\"" paints a clear picture of the real problems faced by women. The topics highlighted throughout resonates with me, having grown up in a third world country where females are constantly abused, degraded and seen as less than that of their male counterparts. The statistics are glaring, but familiar because of my experience in criminal justice research- trying to understand the hidden population of women in prison. I look forward to going through the various topics in the course and welcome the discussions that will ensue."""
"I agree with <redacted>. Statisticians prefer R. For me the availability of additional libraries/extensions for R is unmatched by any competitor. There are libraries for everything. When a statistician publishes a paper nowadays about a new algorithm, the first thing he/she does is make a library available to the public. In this course we will use many libraries to perform different tasks. "
"I wish we were free to use whatever language we want in those online courses. As a computer scientist, I prefer Octave to R because I use another full programming language and I don't need all the bells and whistles of R."
"Despite how startling these statistics are, and their ability to \outrage,\"" I appreciate the fully developed approach to this course. It is inspiring to learn of the strength of women across the globe who unite and confront these issues, when many challenges they face seem wholly insurmountable. I look forward to learning more about the health and human rights issues faced by women across the globe, and hearing more about their perseverance in the face of it all."""

"The comment in the chapter about us all being interconnected globally struck home to me and is a fundamental truth that guides my life. When asked to identify my race, for example, I reply, \human\"". I think it is important as we explore the realities that affect the lives of women around the world that we do not forget that men are also a part of the human race. I once considered myself a feminist (back in the 70s and 80s) but now reject the term because it implies that we can somehow separate the concerns of women from those of the society as a whole ... or that women's issues are more important than those of men. To me (and I realize I am perhaps being heretical here) it is a term that comes from a position of weakness that I refuse to own."
"The term library refers to repositories of R packages. There is one main library, CRAN, that is mirrored all over the world and it contains over 3000 packages.

I agree.
"I would speculate the the US's \allergy\"" to CEDAW is still in effect.  They have signed but not ratified it's passage but yet have not make any formal reservations or objections.  This seems to me to be, in our country's case, not a failure of resources but an act of avoidance.  I would also speculate that this is probably related to the tension of the abortion rights debate in this country.  If they ratify this, what would that look like in terms of enforcement? Would states argue that it impinged upon their religious freedoms? And do religious freedoms get to impinge upon the human rights of others? I personally say, no they do not."""
"The section in the prologue where Anne Firth Murray discusses consulting with the small, grassroots organizations in each area experiencing hardships is a very important piece to focus on. "
"Hello All, "
"Wow, already so excited about this course. The textbook looks fantastic! I've seen some of the statistics before in the Data Sheet, but generally I was surprised by some of the stats... like the first one, where almost across the board, women supported wife beatings more than their male counterparts! So many attitude changes to be made, and this course is an incredible start. Excited about the next chapter!"
Well said!
"Hi, everyone. Thanks for the code which I agree in all of its parts. I am so happy to have this opportunity to be part of this course."
"I'm really encouraged that this course has started with a focus on human rights. It reflects my personal preference to consider 'gender justice', rather than 'gender equality'. Moving from broad, instrumental strategies to individual, human approaches provides real potential for transformative change. "
"The sales numbers are not dollars, they are thousands of units (i.e. count of actual products sold).  See the caption of Figure 2.1 in the textbook."
Most women who believe this were taught so in religiously oriented education programs and saw strong support for the teachings in their homes or communities.  Religion and culture are difficult to separate - in some regions more than others.
"Hi Tara, my sense is that shifting to a human rights or social justice lens helps to frame issues that affect women in a way that emphasizes their rights (and, in some ways, their existence) as individuals that a development lens does not.  For example, looking at something like domestic violence through a development lens acknowledges the affect of domestic violence as a general problem on the economy of a country as a whole, but does not necessarily include any mention or imagination of the lived experience of being in a violent relationship.  A social justice or human rights perspective, I think, helps readers or listeners to see women as individuals, and hopefully as agents as well, rather than as one homogeneous group that is important mostly in the way they affect their country's economic development.  Maybe seeing women living in poverty as individuals can also help people in positions of privilege to identify and empathize with what they are going through, and to look for points of similarity as well as concrete ways to work in solidarity with them.  That's my hope, at least!"
Well written Jencin! I'm also very excited to learn from this course. Good luck from the Netherlands.
"Hi Ruth, Bev and Francisca,"
"The introduction to the course serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of gender inequity as it is experienced by women over the world. Moreover, being born a woman is not something experienced in isolation; women often face the multiple burdens of racial discrimination, indigenous disempowerment and poverty. Therefore, any discussion of global women's health must recognise the multiple levels of discrimination women face daily and not simply address gender in isolation. This is why the concept of gender justice appeals to me. It captures the innate human need for fairness and humanity, and seems more encompassing and responsive to individual needs compared to traditional public health and development models."
"I've read that the coldness of the water causes the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in your body to turn the energy in the food you ate to heat, which equates to burning calories. There is a lot of reasearch backing this. Look into it. I personally turn the temp down to freezing during the last 30 secs of my shower and let the water hit me across my shoulders and neck. Also, the research indicates that the lower your BMI, the higher your BAT. All the more reason to lose weight."

"Truly fascinating how the severe psychosocial stressors in these women's lives manifests as headache, insomnia, \high blood pressure,\"" weight loss, and body pain.  After participating in a medical mission trip to rural Haiti and prescribing almost every adult paracetamol for \""headache,\"" it really makes me question if those headaches weren't identical to those described by the women in this article, rather than the simple headaches from chronic dehydration and untreated hypertension we assumed we were dealing with at the time. It forces me think about how foreign medical assistance would need to do much more than provide medications and education to address the root of these somatic symptoms.  I'm struck by how well it illustrates the importance of autonomy and gender equality for improving overall \""health.\""  The general way \""health' is defined and discussed in the course readings lies in sharp contrast to the very specific physiologic and quantifiable way I have always conceptualized it."""

I found this to be a really important discussion/overview on some of the problems that are so pervasive right now around the world. I really liked how changing language and putting an emphasis on language was discussed.

True. The staff have replied elsewhere that you can use other programs.

"I am a journalist and previously taught journalism to female college students in the Middle East. These issues are close to my heart, and I am so excited to have the opportunity to both better my understanding and become a part of a community of women who are determined to make a change."
"I am thrilled to be taking this course! What an informative class already, and just the prologue. I was surprised at how little research and scholarship has been done on women's health, as mentioned on page xix. The aspect of mental health seems to be such a prevalent piece of what is making women throughout the world \unhealthy\"" in other ways - early marriage, partner abuse, sex trafficking, et cetera. While looking at the PRB statistics it seems almost absurd how many countries offer so little opportunity for women. It appears that in addition to creating more opportunities for women to become educated, have access to health care, and provide an equal voice in the home, populations must educated men in a different light so they are capable of appreciated their female counterparts."""
"I want to begin with a brief examination of the language used in the ¡°United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.¡± I believe that language matters and that the way that issues are spoken about has demonstrable consequences on the way we think and act within our social worlds. While the UN Declaration attempts a holistic and just approach to human rights, I find the language inherently problematic due to its preference for masculine pronouns. In Article One, the document stipulates that all humans ¡°should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.¡± The use of the word brotherhood struck me, as it presupposes that the audience is male and that the primary mode of kinship and understanding comes from typically masculine relationships. Compassion or empathy could have been used in its place, but instead brotherhood gives precedence to a male-oriented way of approaching human life and human experience. Similarly, throughout the document the author(s) rely on the male pronoun. For example, in Article 25, the document states, ¡°Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health of himself and of his family¡± (7, italics added for emphasis). Again, the authors are employing a male perspective in a document that is meant to be read and applied universally. The authors could have used gender-neutral pronouns, or switched between male and female gender pronouns. Instead, the male pronoun is privileged and the female one is absent, a small linguistic example of how deep the preference for patriarchy has been ingrained into international politics and power relations. "
"The author of the poem, I am guessing, is Buddhist. According to Buddhism, all life in this realm, the physical world, is characterized by suffering. This suffering is an escapable and an essential part of this life. Buddhism teaches that you cannot escape this suffering, but rather that you have to acknowledge and live with it if you hope to move into the more important, spiritual dimensions that they believe in. This is why a lot of Buddhist practices involve rituals of self-abasement and pain; a practicing Buddhist actively participates in the suffering endemic of this life in order to make peace with it. Only once you have made peace with it and found a way to reach a meditative state despite the suffering, throwing off all attachment to worldly possessions or materiality, can you move into a \new\"" life. I hope this helps clarify a bit."""
"In general, those that live in rural areas, rather than urban areas, tend to be of a lower socioeconomic status and rely upon farming or subsistence agriculture or other forms of manual labour to survive and provide for their families. This makes people, especially women, more economically vulnerable, since we know that women have more difficulty finding jobs in the work force, and this problem is only further exacerbated in rural settings. The sexual division of labour often places women at home, where they have to tend to the children, prepare meals and clean the house. Often times the women have to fetch the groceries for meals, which could involve long and arduous journeys while tending to their children. Because rural families are more economically vulnerable in certain countries, they may not have enough food to feed their whole families. Men and children tend to eat more than the women, even if the mother is pregnant, nursing or ill. More often than not, the woman or wife is economically dependent upon her husband and may have been taken far away from her family after marriage. If she is domestically abused or assaulted, she may not have the financial means or social/family support system to escape her violent home, and thus may have no choice but to stay in a dangerous and painful situation. Some women think that their only option to escape grinding poverty and abuse is through suicide, even though many cultures condemn suicide and the families may be subsequently shamed. "
"From my understanding,the importance of a human rights lens, in combination with a developmental one, is that it compels states and politicians responsible for their nation's well-being to consider the ways in which the government can and should actively intervene for the rights of people if they are being violated. Dr. Murray gives the example of domestic violence to show that under a human rights lens, it is a public, rather than a private issues, as it has been so long understood. When domestic violence is understood as a public issue, the police and the state can no longer turn a blind eye to the women being abused within their homes by spouses or intimate partners; instead, the state is compelled to act and defend the victims. The state then becomes the ally and the enforcer of rights, rather than a bystander, as it may be under a developmental framework."

"I second LJK85's point. Blaming women for their oppression also puts added pressure on the women who are oppressed-- from the people who are trying to diminish or eliminate that oppression no less! I'm not saying that the decisions that people make when faced with oppression should be free from criticism or even that culture should be free from criticism, but let's not lessen the choices that women make while operating under these constraints either."

"I chose my birth country as opposed to the US, where I currently live. Bosnia and Herzegovina has signed the Optional Protocol and has ratified CEDAW (according to peacewomen.org). According to the United Nations Treaty website, Yugoslavia (the former state to which Bosnia and Herzegovina once belonged to) signed and ratified CEDAW. The CEDAW report also claims that B and H took over the convention of CEDAW in September of 1993, though I am a bit unclear as to what that means."

"I've been working in the domestic violence field for 5 years and I agree with you both that women need to be instill with a sense of self-worth and that both men and women need to understand that violence is never acceptable in a partnership. However, I think we have to also note that there may be women in domestic violence relationships that have a very high self-esteem of themselves, but also out of shame or a sense of embarrassment do not want to admit to being abused. They are so many reasons why domestic violence continues and it'll be interesting to further discuss this topic and see the differences and similarities of what it is still so prevalent globally."
"As a yoga student of 17 years and teacher of 12 years, I've seen many pros and cons to hot yoga.  There are a lot of factors to consider whether or not practicing in a heated room is right for you.  I use my own breath to heat up my body, so I don't need the external heat.  Heating myself up from the inside out leads to a gradual increase in the warmth of my muscles, so I am at little risk of overstretching.  I also have low blood pressure (usually around 90/60).  This makes balancing and inversions in a heated room almost impossible.  It also leads to nausea and dizziness."

"I don't really know how to tactfully comment. I am merely here as a guest worker. But I believe there is still rampant discriminatory practices against women, although think that some in power want to change things for the better. When a woman does not have freedom to determine family size, that seems to be a glaring problem. Furthermore, the \one-child policy\"" with its many variations of implementation is enforced differently based on SES and the wording in some places make it clear that boys are still favored and thus with giving birth to a girl first, you can have a second child, etc."

"In any conflict situation, it is often the women and children who suffer the most - during or even after the conflict or wartime situation. In most ethnic communities in Philippines, for instance, women occupy low status which limits their chances to participate in various spheres including political participation. Likewise, even as violence against women (VAW) has gained visibility as a public policy and public health concern in the country, VAW cases continue and remain under-reported and unreported. Women are constantly subjected to harassment, especially in war conflict affected areas, as a result of continuing war between government troops and rebel forces. Upon return to communities, after conflict-displacement, it is the women who suffered most from loss of property and livelihood, absence of potable water and health services, and the disruption of their children¡¯s education. Rido (clan wars) between families or clans is a constant source of violent conflict in some communities and at high risk in this ritual revenge are the female members or children of the family involved who may be kidnapped, raped, or taken hostage as a way to dishonor or get back at the opponent¡¯s family. "

We now know better."""
Thanks sallysue.
"What attracts me most about this course is its recognition that health care, education, employment and all that are vital for a decent life is a human right, not because women are bearer of children or nurturers of future generations. I have lived and worked in rural Bangladesh in the late 80's. Since then, (and even before) I had always reacted to the reasons of Governments, Donors and the society in general regarding the rationale they provided about the importance of investing in women's health and education. Not once, publicly, have they recognised that women are entitled to services of various sectors simply because it is their right."
"hi,  i am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from kenya. this discussion is very important to me because it it will give me knowledge on how to work towards promoting women health while enhancing the rights of women in my society where gender discrimination is rampant."
"As indicated in the PRB statistics, my research in rural Bangladesh also shows that women think it is okay that their husbands are physically violent with them sometimes, e.g. if the food is not ready in time. A significant proportion also felt that it is a sin to refuse sex when the husband wants it."
"WHO identified 4 areas for women's health to improve.  Women are competing for resources. This leads to gender inequality and lack of empowerment.  There is a lack of access to services and health. Care and education. Society still has attitudes towards women,there role in society and the family.  This then affects their education level, marriage,poverty, literacy and opportunity."
The fact that some men want to be seen as being in charge and having power over women to gain fame in the society will make them beat a woman even on small arguments for people in the society to see that he is in charge. This is especially common in Africa especially on the rural areas

"Indeed, Women rights is the human right. talk of all human degrading acts, it is the women that are at the receiving end. Chapter one of this book has got me thinking what i must do to help the suffering poor around me.when a woman is giving the right to education, equal right with the men in the society, you can not begin to imagine the success stories the family will tell, the children will be well fed, well attended to medically and well educated too. if all in a community will have the idea to treat women the way men are treated, our communities will have less riots, sicknesses, criminals and all sorts bad things just because there are educated women who know how best to train their children. permit me to say that \if you educate a woman, you educate a community\"""""
"Hi, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Italy. First of all I want to thank all those who made this course possible and so accessible. I'm really eager to follow all the lessons and to discuss with all the participants. It's challenging and exciting to have the opportunity to share views with such a big community. I also want to thank all the participants who will share their own experience with us. As for this introductory part, I have to say that the general approach to the topic seems to me very interesting because it tries to link theory and practice, talking about real women who are struggling worldwide. Sometimes, when I start talking about women's rights with some friends I have the impression that many do not really get the importance of the issue and how it affects not only women but any society as a whole. I also think that even if women are the first victims, the unjust system reproducing oppression on women makes it difficult even for men who would otherwise genuinely support the struggle for human rights, to join the cause. That is how challenging it is to seriously try to address gender based discrimination. Involving men is probably the final step and the most challenging. But in some cases it is not possible to address some issues without trying to use this approach. Teenage pregnancy for example, is not only a problem of women's access to health (although of course it is also); too often it has been considered as a problem of girls' behavior while in reality, it is also the result of the lack of men and boys involvement in reproductive health programs (this is also the position of UNFPA in its latest report on Child Motherhood). "
"It seems that statisticians put more weight on evaluating the accuracy of a model, which can sometimes get really mathy, but those who are from CS field(and who are more likely to use the term 'machine learning') care more about topic-specific algorithms. It also seems that most of the commonly used machine learning(or statistical learning if you like) algorithms are introduced by CS people, and stats guys then delved into the mathematical properties of these methods and also came up with evaluating and selecting schemes. Besides, some of the popular machine learning methods have solid statistical background, like Ridge Regression and PCA. "
Hello from Trinidad and Tobago. I'm looking forward for the cross-cultural discussions.
"Countless women and men risk their lives specifically to work for women's human rights and gender equality. As women work to reclaim their rights, they often have to challenge social conventions and deeply entrenched beliefs, risking their own alienation from colleagues and even family and friends. Much of what has been gained in regards to women's human rights has been thanks to the efforts of women themselves. They have achieved dramatic changes in laws, policies and practices even though they encounter additional risks as activists and human rights defenders because of their gender and due to the issues they address. All women deserve a life with the opportunity to be educated, to work, to be healthy and to participate in all aspects of public life. Yet in every country in the world, women and girls live within the confines of rigid gender norms, which frequently result in disproportionate access to essential services and major violations of their human rights.For women and girls to fully participate in their communities and enjoy their rights, they need a life free from gender-based discrimination- a life with the opportunity to be educated, to work safe jobs with adequate and equal pay, to be healthy, and to participate in all aspects of public life"
PHILIPPINES:
"Security Council Resolution 1325 was passed unanimously on 31 October 2000. It invited Secretary-General Kofi Annan to carry out a study on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, the role of women in peace-building and the gender dimensions of peace processes and conflict resolution. Resolution (S/RES/1325) is the first resolution ever passed by the Security Council that specifically addresses the impact of war on women, and women's contributions to conflict resolution and sustainable peace. The Security Council was concerned about civilians in armed conflict, particularly women and children, who constituted most of the victims and were increasingly targeted by armed elements. This in turn had an impact on the possibilities for peace and reconciliation. Women played an important role in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and therefore it was important that they were equally involved in the process of maintaining international peace and security. It was also recognized the need to adopt a gender perspective in peacekeeping operations and the training of personnel on women's rights."
The empowerment of women is becoming an international burden; today more people are aware of the injustices and inequities between genders than any time before this. It's heartening and encouraging to read of the different results of women in various nations coming into consciousness as Gerda Lerner puts it.

That's why it happens a lot accepting the beating, and even worse, blaming themselves for that, tough he's wrong. And lots of women don't have courage to fight against it, and call the police, because society makes her believe that she deserved, that men is always right no metter what. "

"The preference of a boy to a girl child has been a very big challenge to women. In ibo land in Nigeria for example, women are sent parking for not having a male child, though now they seem to be enlightened but this outrageous treatment still goes on.

I hope to be a STRONG women and Child's right advocate. My mother suffered hardship and sometimes at midnight she would cry because of the harsh treatment she got from her husband. awareness should be created in rural as well as urban towns, to educate women and men, to equip women to be able to stand and defend themselves.

Hello everybody happy to take this course! I agree with the code
I am always amazed at the similarities across contexts and geography when it comes to issues of human rights and in particular the experiences of women. I am not suggesting that there are not vast differences but so many stories shared in chapter one echo strings of stories that I have heard in my work in southern Ontario Canada at a rape crisis centre. I am clear the intersections of social identity inform one's experiences of human rights but there is this thread of humanity both when it exists and when it is absent that connects us all layering our stories over geography and time. And a thread of resilience. I am really excited about this course. It has been ten years since grad school and though I have been working on the ground in the arena of human rights it has been awhile since I have had the time and space to explore the issues in an academic sense.

I think it is so incredibly sad that the United States refuses to sign and ratify either treaty in part because of the far right's condemnation of abortion.  It is such a small aspect to a huge overlying issue and should people's personal opinions on it should not stand in the way of important rights for women and children.
I have found myself hesitating to comment on something that jumped out at me at the end of the chapter as I was reviewing the organizations that were highlighted and the great work that they are doing around the world...

"It is no secret that an empowered, educated woman is the most effective and powerful catalyst for sustainable change, and yet women's health issues are so often ignored! It is appalling that the leading cause of death in young women aged 15-19 in developing countries is complications in pregnancy and child birth! This number could so easily be halved it proper attention was given to reproductive health education, especially sexual health - and contraceptives! In Nairobi's Mathare slum, approximately 40% of girls said their first sexual encounter was not their choice, which leads to a much bigger problem but also demonstrates how a woman's sexuality is consistently taken advantage of, and treated as an object."
"Yes, deadly indeed. Gender selection abortions is a HUGE problem in many countries, including India and China, and becoming increasingly common in America and Europe as well. Although it is difficult to get accurate statistics for people's true reasons for terminating a pregnancy, by looking at others numbers in addition to cultural views and personal stories it is rather obvious that boys are desired over girls. Women are made to feel responsible for the gender of the baby, even though the man contributes equally, or it could be said, more. When I think of the number of women throughout history who were executed for the \inability\"" to produce male heirs, before people studied the science of reproduction, the treatment today towards women has not improved even knowledge has. Even being shunned can have a huge affect on women's emotional and mental health."""

"I am greatly encouraged by the text that we will be using during this course.  It appears that the writer is highly knowledgeable and articulates the root causes of these issues effecting women.  I already have learned that mental health is a highly contributing factor to poor choices and poverty in developing countries.  I was surprised to read that many health issues could be prevented if we focused on mental health.  It was also interesting to learn that virtually no studies have been done on this, especially among women, until the studies for this text."
"Avotri and Walters¡¯ piece ¡°¡¯We Women Worry A Lot About Our Husbands¡¯¡± highlighted several key issues when assessing women¡¯s health. They identify the problem that women¡¯s health has almost been exclusively understood as synonymous with maternal or reproductive health, which is in fact only a small part of women¡¯s biological lives. They then reason that this reproductive health agenda often comes from assumptions about women¡¯s health, rather than actual needs assessments within women¡¯s communities. It seems like such a simple step, but it just goes to show how blinkered health services have been that they wouldn¡¯t think to ask women what health problems they are most concerned with. I think this failure to consult the women is but a further demonstration of the problems with Western and foreign aid, that, despite their best intentions, often end up speaking for communities and populations they know very little about, presuming, with a sort of buried ethnocentric mindset, that they know more than the communities they aim to help. One way that the authors could have elaborated further on this problem is by providing a follow-up study in which they consult the Ghanaian women they interviewed to find out how they think their psychosomatic ills and ailments can be ameliorated. "
"A woman's discrimination begins at birth, even before, as outlined in the feasting rituals outlined in chapter 2. Interesting that one mother interviewed did not feel any remorse - too jaded by the harsh realities of her own life as a woman to even consider the possibility of hope and change. These societies are so set in their male-dominated ways, and are convinced that a woman's value is not much more than cooking, cleaning, and providing a son."

It is a shame that it takes a concerted effort to clarify that women's rights are synonymous with human rights and play a large role in global stability. The notion that many countries are only tapping into 50% of their intellectual capital as they struggle to develop as a nation is telling of their slow progress.
"For this kind of problem, we require you only to provide the final result. For example, provide in response to (c)i. the numerical summary of the variables in the data set. It is good practice to include relevant R code as an appendix (or knitted into your document, if you are using R Markdown)."
"These statistics are staggering. Framing the context of women's rights in terms of an all encompassing definition of what health really is for every human being really opens the playing field for equality. It is always interesting how perception and globally accepted definitions effect progress. I love the concept noted in the lectures and reading that by simply getting those definitions out there to women in developing nations, these movements can grow and build their own momentum towards change. Education really is everything. People don't know what they don't know."

"I also noticed the country comparison and what was said about the US. Despite it not being what we would call the strongest example, I thought it was necessary for two reasons. The first being that it humbled the book so that it is not just another piece of literature created by people in the US that choose to overlook women's issues on the domestic front. It helps to work against the classism that can often happen when people write/learn about disparities in other countries. Again, I do think that there are stronger women's rights issues in the US that could have been used as an example, but I am glad that a flaw was highlighted as well. The second reason I thought the quote had merit was because it highlighted the fact that women's rights are no longer an issue that individual countries have to figure out. More and more the lines between countries and global health are becoming blurred. The country comparison helps to show that the issues are pervasive around the world and although all approaches to improve conditions must be culturally appropriate, they also need to focus on the improvement of women's rights and women's health everywhere."
"I think that this Chapter relates to Professor Stacey's point about how girls in many cultures and parts of the world as seen as \fungible assets\"" that can be exchanged like goods or commodities for monetary value or favors. With the increasing globalization and influence of capitalism in the world, more and more dispossessed and vulnerable communities are being treated as objects and commodities rather than human beings. They are valued as bodies which can be used and manipulated, rather than individuals imbued with dignity and integrity. The chapter also highlights the double-edged sword of antenatal technology and the emerging questions of bioethics. Though it would seem that new technologies like amniocentesis would be a great boon to families, and would help the wife plan for possible complications in her pregnancy and delivery, there is a dark side to knowledge about the fetus. It truly is an extremely complicated issue, as Dr. Murray notes: feminists and activists are torn between a woman's right to choose and the choose being dictated by cultural values that preference males over females. To impede or obstruct a woman's right to choose is a hugely politically and morally complex problem, and yet the choice may not be so much of a \""choice\"" if the woman's decision is constricted and limited by cultural attitudes towards women, especially if the woman is pressured by her husband and her family to abort. "
"The concept of the feminization of poverty was new to me as before reading this chapter I hadn't before considered the degree to which the lives of women are dictated and affected by poverty as compared to men. This concept seems especially important, and disheartening, after learning that \in many countries more than 30% of households are headed by single females.\"" I cannot begin to imagine the cyclical effect, the undeniable ripple affect, this has for the generations of women born into these impoverished, single-female-led households. While this situation causes obvious developmental and economic deficiencies, as mentioned in the chapter, I do appreciate the lens of human rights on this issue (re: ¡°human rights and public health are two complementary approaches, and languages, to address and advance human well-being¡±). Especially in a world that seems to systematically hold women back, especially women of lower socioeconomic backgrounds, I think it makes a big difference to consider this issue as one of justice, not just of greater economic gains, etc. Reading the examples of organizations that address the issues women face and help empower them was inspiring and an important reminder also that literacy (and education in general) is often the best vehicle with which to climb the socioeconomic ladder."""

"TowensO, your words definitely resonate with me.  I was born into a family of all boys (just me and my younger brother) and my mom too would routinely tell friends how happy she was to have boys instead of girls.  It always struck me funny when I heard this because I had a hard time imagining how raising a girl would be any more difficult than raising my brother and I, two kids who would constantly fight with each other and rarely do all the required chores without complaining.  In fact, I think it made me imagine difficulties of raising girls that were very likely conflated and imaginary, perhaps influenced by poor media representations as you suggest.  Its sad to me that this conscious or unconscious preference for more of my gender is a worldwide phenomenon as Dr. Murray suggests in her book.  My wife and I don't have any kids yet but if we're blessed to have some down the road, I want our only preference to be a baby that is healthy, regardless of gender."

I am really excited to take the class because I am a sociology major and I try to read about issues affecting women all over the world. I am looking forward to learning more in this class.

"The quote ¡°make injustice visible¡± resonates deeply with me because I have only recently been exposed to such statistics and to the study of women in general. In secondary school, we learned nothing about domestic violence other than that we must not let ourselves become victims to it. However, this prologue discusses the public and the private spheres where the rights of women and children as well as their sufferings were ignored. We did not learn about women as ¡°collateral damage¡± in war, indeed, there were very few mentions of women in any of those chapters in our textbooks. History below the collegiate level mentions very few women but how could human history have forgotten half of its population? Now, as the roles are evolving and changing and more light is shed on the female legacy, women¡¯s voices are growing louder. Many Americans believe that the women¡¯s movement belonged to the 19th century and that now everything is solved, but we are still going through a women¡¯s movement, nationally and internationally."

Greetings from Washington DC. I have been working in public health for over ten years. I have mainly focused on domestic and international HIV prevention programs. I am excited to delve deeper into women's health issues and continue reading the thought provoking books and resources.

"The United States signed, but didn't ratify CEDAW. It appears the US is the only country, besides Palau, who hasn't ratified CEDAW. This fact really hits the point home for me that there is still so much work to be done in the realm of women's rights here in the United States."
"The two articles are very much reflective of almost all societies including the Philippines. On health situation for instance, women and children especially in remote areas do not have access to quality health services including reproductive health services which also causes the deaths of many pregnant women and children. There is also a lack of age and sex disaggregated data which makes it more difficult to really plan and provide appropriate intervention mechanism. Still, there is also a lack of age-appropriate sexuality and reproductive health education. "

I'm so thankful for reporters like <redacted> <redacted> and leading maternal health advocates who have shined a light on the serious and life-threatening reproductive struggles facing women throughout the world. But the interviews with the women in Ghana exposed a reality that I'm ashamed to admit I haven't thought about nearly enough -- and that is the mental health battles being waged by these same women. Of course there are intense and overwhelming feelings of powerlessness and a persistent fear of failing to thrive in an expected role. It makes so much sense and yet it is so rarely discussed. What a powerful and important study!

"I'm so glad to have found this course!  I work in higher education administration and am also working to become a certified doula.  Given my current interests in learning more about maternal health and outcomes, I was most taken back by the statistics surrounding world-wide reproductive health.  I knew that U.S. statistics on maternal death were disheartening, but I hadn't seen any data that goes quite to the extent that this piece does in terms of a country-by-country breakdown.  It's fascinating (and sad) to see the variations in seemingly economically similar countries regarding birth support and maternal outcomes in live births.  While my own focus and goals are to help  lead women to positive birth outcomes locally, an understanding of global maternal wellness is important for my own education.  Discussion on these topics is so important to bring the harsh realities of worldwide maternal issues to light."

France signed the CEDAW in 1980 and ratified in 1983. The French government made some reservations at article 5 and 6 mainly regarding the joint exercise of parental authority. However the government withdrew these reservations in 1986 because of existing discriminations against women in the rules governing property rights arising out of matrimonial relationship and in those concerning the legal administration of the property of children.

"Hello everyone. First of Im thrilled to know that this course is available worldwide. My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> Rico, a student who wants to Major in Social work. Human justice is my passion. I love learning. Super excited to be in this online course. As a women i feel that womens health care is overlooked and at times ignored. Living in a male dominated society women are still not fully in charged of their health/reproductive rights. One of the main reasons i believe this is because not enough women are actively engaged due to the lack of public awareness/knowledge."
There are a bunch of threads already on the discussion forum about this. Please post in those threads rather than any random thread.
"But to form a CI you need the critical value of $t$. To get that you need the degrees of freedom for the distribution. An assumption is being made that either i) an approximate 95% confidence interval is OK, or ii) that $n$ is large. So whilst to get the Answer the authors want you don't need to look up the critical value of $t$, you do need to make an assumption that they want you to use 2 as that value."

"I appreciated Akila Radhakrishnan's discussion about women's right and access to abortion after rape and the way sexual violence against women is used to break down the fabric of a society in times of war. We've heard a few times now the phrase 'bodily integrity'. Especially after listening to Radhakrishnan discuss how language can be used to reframe sexual violence as less stigmatizing for the victims and as an important issue of basic human rights, I feel like I personally understand the phrase more fully. I also thought it was interesting to hear how the Global Justice Center is working with countries undergoing major political transitional periods, such as Burma, to set up legislative frameworks that allow women's rights to be addressed as fundamental human rights within a country. "

"I feel like all the problems surrounding women have been naturalized, if a woman suffers violence is because she \deserves it\"", \""she did something to get it\"" or she provoked the agressor. Being born female is a problem specially in developing countries, the girls are the ones who end up helping their mother with the other girls of the house while the \""men of the house\"" go to work and the boys go to school. There is always a disadvantage towards the girls. And if they go to school together, women will abandon it earlier because they end up getting married early, pregnant or their mother just need their help at home. All this problems lead to mental problems that aren't necessarily discussed when going to a doctors appointment, if they get to go to one. In Ecuador women of low resources don_t go to the doctor, they provide their own medicine based on ancient beliefs of their communities (because most of women of low resources are indigenous) and there is a high rate of death at birth because they have their kids at home. They belong to the man of the family and cant do anything without their consent."""
"I think it's important to think about the context in which women are giving birth when thinking about the safety of medicalized versus home-based practices.  First, among many home birth midwives in the US at least, I know that prenatal care and nutritional support are key, as well as screening for risks such as gestational diabetes and pregnancy induced high blood pressure throughout pregnancy.  Ideally, homebirth would be part of a comprehensive health care system that included collaborations among midwives, doctors, and other health care providers.  This is not yet a reality in the US.  "
What a wide range of cross-cultural perspectives we'll have in this course! I am so excited to be a part of this journey with you all and look forwarded to many more enlightening conversations!

"Hello!  My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I work in the field of higher education in Texas.  I feel very privileged and excited to be a part of this conversation.  Since attending a workshop several years ago at a seminary on the issue of human trafficking, I have had an increasing desire to educate myself about this and other women¡¯s issues globally.  My desire in participating in this class is to, not only learn more, but to also discover ways that I can practically make a difference.  I would also like to bring more awareness to my community, especially those in my church congregation.  A quote from the text that resonated with me was ¡°Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world¡¯s grief. Do justly, now. Love mercy, now.  Walk humbly, now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it.¡±  I often find myself feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed by the injustices occurring in the world and unsure where to start or what positive impact I can make."

"That number is insane 60% of women in Sri Lanka face gender based violence, and 61.7% of women in Palestine suffer psychological violence. Its a sad sad predicament faced by these women no one should have to live with that."

Looking forward to this course!

It was my understanding that funds for abortion in developing countries were non existent from the US during the Bush era but that this had changed as soon as Obama became president. Is this not true? I am very surprised to hear this.
"Before reading the first chapter, I had never really sat down to think about how fortunate I am to live in the USA and exercise my right to an education while also having the benefit of laws protecting my well being against violence. Professor Murray made a great point about the fact that as a human race we are all interconnected whether we are rich/poor, black/white, or female/male. Female rights are indeed human rights. It's great to know that this has been established as a global issues and that many organizations mentioned are taking the steps to correct the wrongs against women."
"The section of the prologue that talked about how following the news can be overwhelming and depressing rang very true. I appreciate the focus on grassroots and individual efforts to create positive change, rather than only focusing on the problems without solutions."

The picture in the background. Each week it has the same theme as the topic of the week. I won't say more so as not to give it away.

Thank you for sharing it!
Absolutely!  And there are 3 more things that participants have come up with as well.
"I appreciated that this chapter set the stage for the topics we will delve into later by first approaching the question of why a human rights framework is necessary. Despite the existing research and evidence that shows how helping women leads to better health/literacy/etc. within families and communities, we as people have failed to follow through and create big change in these areas. Part of the problem as I see it is that the personal is too messy. It is typically considered more \feminine\"" to focus in on the individual stories of people like Kamla. It's far more \""masculine\"" to take broad swipes at solving development issues. (I use the quotation marks because I do not believe that these are set, concrete gender characteristics but ones that have built over over centuries and are deeply ingrained). It usually takes a women-led organization or group to help tell these stories and capture us at an emotional level. Rather than numbers and impersonal data, the human rights approach can see success by giving us stories that we may be able to relate to and that bring the issues home, so to speak. I look forward to using this lens to learn more in the coming weeks."""
"What wonderful work! I haven't heard of your organization before but am now very interested in its goals. I could see how you would have to frame the work in terms of decreasing maternal and infant mortality, but it is so, so much more than that. Women deserve to be treated with dignity at that particularly emotional juncture in their lives. It is simply not enough to live through it. The outcome for mother and child will no doubt be better with well-rounded care that takes them into account as something other than mortality statistics."

Your silly jokes!
I'm glad the topic of language was brought up as it helped me understand that human rights approach better. It's mind-boggling to think about sexual violence being considered collateral damage when it so clearly is a crime against humanity and a gross violation of a person's bodily autonomy.
"Based on this very brief description, it sounds like a range of motion issue (sometimes known as flexibility).  In my work with clients (of which you are my target demographic), I emphasize three things:  strength, flexibility, and balance.  I think we need all three in mostly equal amounts to maintain optimal function in life as we age.  "
"It seems kind of petty I suppose, but I like to read along with the video.   There are many errors such as  periods in the middle of sentences and the wrong form of a word like \to\"" instead of \""too.\""  I find it jarring.   This last video was no exception.  :(  Having said that, I am loving the course for content."""
"It's refreshing to read/hear an interview in which there is so much candor about the state of human rights in the world. I'm not typically an optimist by any means, but can we see it as at least a small win that at the very least, nations are feeling the pressure to acknowledge the existence of human rights, even if they are unable or are unwilling to act on enforcing them at this time? It's not that long ago that many would simply deny many of these rights and that treaties and declarations of the sort mentioned wouldn't even exist. By signing them, there is at least an understanding that these are very real issues. We just need to apply more pressure where we can to make sure there is follow through so that they don't end up as empty promises."
"Belgium has signed the CEDAW on July, 17, 1980 and has ratified it on July, 10, 1985."
"My country, France, is part of those countries who signed but took good care of drafting quite some declarations and reservations so that the text does not endanger too much the \status quo\"" over here. "
What are some of the relevant metrics to compare the performance of classification and regression on the same problem?
"It wouldn't be believed because society tends to think of age in terms of a stereotype which is at least 50 years out of date. Assumptions are based on observations from a period when physical hard work was the norm, medicine was not particularly effective and not particularly affordable for most people. More recent data sets rely on data from a period when labour saving devices were available and affordable and a sign of good living for the masses, and convenience and fast foods were popular. So the stereotype combines a hard lifestyle which wore the body out, and a sedentary lifestyle which brought a different set of health risks. What the stereotype doesn't include is the more recent population who had no need to wear the body out to earn a living, recognised the danger of being sedentary, and had the physical, financial, and information resources to adopt a more active lifestyle."
"Many treaties, agreements, articles and so forth.  Unfortunately the only truth is the reality in the enforcement and accountability any nation has.  I believe it is terribly neglected in many areas, regardless of who signed what..."
"Very good idea! I mostly run and don't have a coach either. A PT helped evaluated my range of motion, specific running movements and core strength and we figured out the cause of my imbalances. The specific exercises she recommended absolutely kept me from injury."
"Hi,"
"I agree; men need to be part of the movement, but the direction and focus needs to come from women.  As Anne Firth Murray mentioned several times, the topics we'll be discussing are the issues that women themselves indicated were most important.  So long as the movement remains securely under the guidance of the women who created it, men's involvement is very important."
I am happy to be part of such great discussions with people from all over the world!
Hi !
As a fellow midwife - I would love to chat with you more  about maternal/child health care. I'll keep an eye out for you in the coming weeks :)
"Great question.  Although it can be beneficial in terms of longevity for animals to be calorically restricted through the equivalent of adolescence, they will end up smaller throughout their adult life. The same is probably true for humans as well: Maybe a benefit in terms of longevity and health (although that is unknown at this point), but smaller in stature as an adult. Do remember that CR is different than malnutrition, so kids that don't get enough food and nutrients are frequently both smaller and unhealthy."

Often in developing countries the term midwife may be used when describing what some people living in developed countries may call a traditional birth attendant. Often TBAs do not have formal training (i.e. from a recognized facility as those in developed countries have access to) Taiwo - please correct me if I misunderstood your comment but I think that's what you meant.

"I spent a good part of 2008 and 2009 working with organizations focused on freeing women from domestic violence and trafficking situations and helping with their healing and pursuit of a better life. From there I began my bachelor's degree focusing on art and film production, with the hope that someday I will use film to connect the world through our greatest source of justice: communication. Communicating the goals of human rights and cultural understanding through film and art is my life goal. "
I hope you can increase your voice for your lecture.
"It also stood out to me that women bear the brunt of poverty because of the enormous responsibilities that they are given (taking care of children, providing for the family, pleasing their husbands). In \We Women Worry a Lot about our Husbands,\"" authors Avotri and Walter argue that in order to improve women's health in the developing world, policy-makers must consider the woman's relationship with her husband and psychological stress associated with this relationship instead of solely focusing on improving purely \""medical\"" outcomes, such as child-birth. I thought that this concept was really interesting. Even though investigating the relationship between husband and wife is not a large component in health-policy in the US where I live, there are still efforts to look beyond the limited definition of health as being \""free from illness\"" and encompass a more holistic definition of health which includes happiness, social connectedness, and relationships -- things that should be emphasized when creating health policy in the developing world as well."""
I am interested to learn more about these issues to inform my work and my future. I consult to companies in the resource sector and see enormous opportunity for women and men to create long lasting changes in communities that depend on natural resource development. Looking forward to connecting with others.
"I'm not sure there is an option to accept a culture or not. A culture is what it is. While I believe that inhumane practices should be outlawed I know that laws do not change culture. The focus needs to be on doing what is necessary to change the culture. It requires not only educating the women but men and children, leaders and law makers. The entire community has to buy in to make positive changes."
Very smart of you!  Having a knowledgeable set of eyes watch you is invaluable.  I've had some of my least favorite positions become my favorite through knowledgeable instruction and through proper preparation.
"The theory seems to imply that reduced oxygen would come from the heat.  I guess I have a hard time imagining that you'd be oxygen deficient when running at that pace, even in that heat.  But it seems important and interesting."
Amazing how a country built on the freedom of people's can unintentionally backfire when it turns that attitude into pride.  Part of recognizing human rights is the ability to change and to grow.  The United States could definitely be incredibly influential in the area of women's health and human rights when it is willing to better itself.
"Hello! My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, and I am very excited to take this course. I am quite passionate about human rights, particularly women's, and am looking forward to hone my knowledge regarding Women's Health. Personally, I was not shocked with the information provided by the prologue, and I'm very glad that Stanford offers this course to help many people understand that women all over the globe STILL encounter many horrendous issues."
"I was very surprised to learn that the UK has actively resisted ratifying CEDAW, even though they have signed it. Overall the Uk with the EU has a fairly good human rights record, since 1945 at least. But there is still a surprisingly long way to go, which I don't think a lot of UK citizens even realise, never mind act upon. But I think UK citizens are aware of social inequality generally, and act upon that as they are able instead."
"The United States has not signed CEDAW as mentioned in the interview.  I find this a bit discouraging, however, I have not read CEDAW in its entirety.  I think that of the many things the U.S. has been willing to do, or at least consider, that treaties like this should be at the top of the list when being considered.  This would set a good example for countries who are looking to the United States when trying to better their governments."

My work has in the past taken me frequently to Bangladesh implementing a range of health and safety programs and though I am now retired I continue to work in a voluntary capacity. This is a wonderful opportunity to meet like minded people throughout the world. I want nothing more from this course than to increase my understanding and knowledge."
"Just as women will often promote their own abuse in developing countries, it is saddening to learn and read that women will also promote their own deaths, such as in infanticide.  In the first part of the chapter we read an example of a woman who felt she was doing her child a favor by murdering it, because she was saving it from having to lead that same life that she is. It shows that obviously the problem is more deeply rooted than simply men killing female infants or mother murdering their daughters because they don't care.  They live in a corrupt enough system that causes them to kill because they care.  How tragic."
"So nice to meet everyone. I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, a nurse-midwife in Detroit. Most of my patients are immigrant women from Yemen and other parts of the middle-east. I have a background in epidemiology and recently completed a doctorate in nursing practice and a fellowship in clinical ethics. After 36 years it's time for me to leave clinical care and share what I have learned through teaching, writing, and administration. International health and health disparities are a life-long passions that I am hoping to focus on."
"I liked seeing the break down of the PRB data because it really made clear that money, not necessarily regions or specific countries can influence health decisions and outcomes. I hadn't thought of those differences before- just assumed it was a region or country specific phenomenon."
How cool that you can take online courses while doing your Peace Corps service! I hope it adds an academic edge to all that immersion! I did PC/Madagascar and that would have been a great complement to help digest things that I saw everyday. Good luck!
"I was also surprised to see the statistics where a slightly higher percentage of women endorsed violence against other women compared to their male counterparts. Why would the women surveyed imply that the lives and safety of these other women are not as important as the men's lives and safety? Essentially that's what these statistics are insinuating-- that women's and men's lives are valued differently to some. I'm interested to see what factors play into these beliefs because I was pretty shocked to see these stats. While I recognize that everyone has different opinions, it is unfortunate to see such high percentages of people endorsing violence towards women."
"The athlete's heart has intrigued generations of cardiologists, exercise physiologists, and basic research scientists. Cardiac and cardiovascular adaptations to high endurance exercise enhance the Inotropic (contractility), Lusitropic (relaxation), and modulate the Chronotropic (heart rate pacing) properties of the heart. Maximal endurance exercise is characterized by a 5 to 7+ fold increase in cardiac output,a 3 to 4 fold increase in heart rate, a 2 to 3 fold increase in stroke volume, and a 3 fold increase in the A-V Oxygen difference.High endurance training is characterized by an increase in both left and right cardiac chamber dimensions, wall thickness and mass. Transient mechanical dysfunction of the heart with simultaneous release of biomarkers ( troponins - small structural proteins of the muscle contraction apparatus ) has been documented in different types of athletes in rather heterogeneous populations ( marathon runners, soccer players, cyclist and others )."
thanks for this
"I am currently taking prerequisites to return to graduate school to become a women's health practitioner.  Perusing the statistics in The World's Women and Girls Data sheet has reaffirmed my goal of taking the skills set I hope to develop in the next few years abroad.  The most alarming statistics coming from my background are the percentages for men making decisions about women's health care (though this happens in many cases in terms of legislation, my hope would be on an individual level decisions could be made more independently or in joint with a partner, though I suspect in some places or cases it may falsely appear that this is what is happening when really men are making the decisions).  The disparity in AIDS prevalence in young women and young men is alarming.  In Southern Africa the difference is more than 8%! Of course the women believing that physical abuse is okay in any situation, especially when she refuses sex,m is very unnerving.  It is reassuring that our text will introduce us to organizations and individuals starting to making progress at the grassroots level to induce change and move forward on such pressing issues. I look forward to learning from their experiences and allowing their theories to inspire me to find my own route to contributing to progress."
It's great to see other women's health practitioners in hither class.  I am taking prerequisites to peruse midwifery now.  Look forward to your comments!

"Hello everyone, I am very excited to have encountered such a great opportunity to increase my knowledge and exposure to a topic that is so relevant to me. First of all, I would like to say that I am thrilled to see people of many different nationalities take this course, and it makes me happy to see how many people are truly passionate about human rights and how many of you strive to create awareness and change things for better."
"My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, and I am excited about taking this course because I'm very interested in global health.  I am attending medical school in the fall and want to pursue a specialty that will have a strong international focus. However, even after studying, researching, and interning with a focus on global health and poverty, I still have so much to learn and am still trying to figure out how to help solve some of these issues in the medical field. For instance, I hadn't really considered the role of women's health and aging until it was mentioned in the prologue. Most information about women's health is from a maternal and child health perspective, which wouldn't account for all of the grandmothers in the world or other female community members. I am very interested to learn about that issue (as well as all of the other issues) and can't wait to see what else I will learn about international women's health."
"I had never considered the possibility that some countries simply would not have the revenue to implement practices/laws that would insist and support women's rights in their countries. The USA does not have that excuse, however, and it was quite disappointing to not see it as a more active participant in CEDAW."
"Hi everyone! I work for a rape crisis center and am very interested in women's rights and access to health care. I appreciated the WHO's definition of health to include other types besides physical. In my work, I see the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit and know that they are all equally important for a person's well-being. Having worked extensively with refugees, I was very interested in the statistics on women's health, specifically reproductive. Seeing that 1 in 10 women in Afghanistan will die from birth complications gives me such appreciation for the mothers who sacrificed everything to bring their children to a new country for a better, healthier life. "

"Indeed! I cannot even begin to imagine the pain these women face everyday, the fear of not having enough to provide for her children, or the fear that they next time her husband shows her 'love', she will be infected with a disease. These issues are not discussed nearly enough in western culture today. We have become too far removed from our brothers and sisters in other countries."
"I \know\"" that exercise will eliminate, help reduce, keep away various health issues, but just taking this module has really opened my eyes/mind up to the reality and truth of it and more importantly, the long term effect it can have. It's actually given me the motivational push to actually start being more physically active now. The way you presented this module really made me think more about what I need to do now and continue to do to make the inevitable aging process go more smoothly. Thank you!"""

"Questioning the change of narrative within language was an excellent surprise. Although the international overview was briefly touched on the response, I would like to add that there has been more developments regarding this issue in the U.S., than for example Latin America, where the narrative's changes are very slow and often span over to generations, and not because of a directly education-influenced decision, but mostly the change steams from being a survivor of abuse or a witness of it in the same family."
I accept the code of conduct. Looking forward to the course and discussions.
Internalized misogyny that's learned by institutionalized patriarchal frames.
"I respectfully disagree, though I can understand why a lot of people believe this. I think that by saying that women need a shift in their thinking, the thing that's actually shifting is on whom the blame of the abuse lies."

I note in our last CEDAW review they commented that women can access abortion because our law is implemented \benevolently\"". In other words an outdated law is flouted to ensure access and choice. There is no mood in politics to approach this issue so women continue to be infantilised  by the abortion approval process requiring two doctors to approve every abortion."""
"What emerges from this very interesting talk is the mixture of political strategy and economic interests behind governments'decisions to sign, and especially ratify and implement international human rights covenants in their countries. "
"Akila highlights something that is profound, that as long as we continue to look upon domestic violence as shameful , then it becomes difficult for women to stand up against it. Although in my country we have quite a good domestic violence piece of legislation, i think the human rights aspect of it has not yet been fully recognized. the fact that as a woman you have the right to be free from violence and to bodily integrity instead of continuously thinking that its your fault it has happened. great interview!"
"The stories of these women are similar in some ways to the stories of women in the west prior to the women's liberation movement. Economic disempowerment, limited role definition and rules for women, unrecognised hard work and depression and anxiety. Similarly they would have seen reproduction as a given and not something to be complained about as the centre of their distress. However the setting and the degree of disempowerment is much greater and in an enlightened world should be able to be better  helped."
"My country - Italy- appears to belong to the group of those countries which promptly signed the convention in 1980. It then took 5 years to ratify it, but anyway the good intentions, so to say, were there. Generally, I believe the attitude of my country is to join the international community in all those agreements which promote democracy and justice, mainly as a matter of good image and as a strategy of foreign policy developed especially after the shame of Fascism and the alliance with the German National Socialism during WWII. It should also be said, that as our Constitution was written after the the atrocities of the war, many \human rights\"" principles are already embedded in our Constitution, therefore it feels kind of \""natural\"" for the government of my country to comply with the UN treaties and confirm its commitment also in front of the world."

I run long distance (half and full marathons), and do all kinds of sports (ski, swim, cycle...).

"As you work your body produces heat. Some of this heat is lost through radiation, convection, conduction and evaporation. The rest is retained by the body and raises the body temperature. When you are pre-cooled, it takes more heat to reach critical temperature. More heat required means more work to be done."
"It's very common to project other people's issues onto self when enculturised to do so. If you've been raised to believe that it is  your fault if you are hit, then it takes a lot to break out of that."

"A Malawian woman I know asked her husband how much lobolo (bride price) he'd paid to marry her, paid him back, and said \now we're divorced.\"" She subtracted the rent she'd paid on their house throughout their marriage and the school fees she'd paid for her children. Those were meant to be his responsibility. It does happen!"""
yes this should be a real relaxed class that I will love to learn about

Interesting question.

Hi my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I live in Minnesota where it is real cold we are having a heat wave of 27 degrees today and we are suppose to get about 1 to 3 inches of snow tonight.  I am a single mom and decided since I am not working now that I could do these courses on line

"Hello everybody,"
This was a really insightful interview with Helen Stacy.
"Could not have been better put.(Outrage to Courage pg.9-10)-Points out that for decades we have been looking at the need for Women(our mothers,sisters and daughters) to access overall health and healthcare entirely in terms of them being tools and an end of Increasing economic productivity and reducing consumption of the wealth (which they created to their disadvantage)by provision of FP;and not as their human rights in what was intended as an equal partnerships in the perpetuation,development and sustenance of a better human race.The Title fits \OUTRAGEOUS\""...I am deeply moved by the new self awareness."""
"I agree with your comments, especially the last one about male involvement. Attitude and behavior change can be accomplished, with small steps, but it's very important to engage men, as they directly affect the well-being and health of women."
Per Marc's advice - definitely talk to your doctor.  I'm 55 and use a Polar HRM.  I've hit 180 a few times and was told to dial it back as that level of exertion can lead to congestive heart failure.
Thanks a lot for this module. It gave me inspiration and motivation to change my lifestyle and increase physical activity asap. I'm still in my 20's but now I see that it's better to start sooner than later. 
"Kindly accept my gratitude.A sobering appropriate approach to Human rights.Can longer label human rights advocates and campaigners as \Political Activists,Selfish attention seeking,rebels without cause\""-Gratitude once more i am now at peace with myself and my neighbors."""
"The US Constitution was ratified by all 13 states. Only 9 of the original 13 states needed to ratify the Constitution, but eventually all 13 did ratify the Constitution. The last state was in 1790."
"I didn't get the impression that she was \condemning\"" India for its reservation in the treaty; she simply noted that it is currently unable to implement an accurate census. In all instances, even for those emerging cold war countries, she appeared sympathetic to the difficulties of compliance. It was the wiggle room countries that she appeared to be judging harshly."""
"If you live in the US, you know we are fighting a daily battle against the far right and its imposition on the rights of women and other vulnerable populations. Women my age are marching/protesting against the same things we marched/protested about in the 70s and that our Mothers marched/protested for in the 60s. I wasn't at all surprised to learn the US has not ratified CEDAW given the strength of the far right coalition."
"TO;<redacted><redacted>-As you rightly put it,the in-depth historical explanation gives fabric and the right perspective."
"This is a great way to advance along the learning curve.  I have always found that side issues like the use of \(\"" vs \""[\"" vs what not have to be mastered before getting to the meat of a system.  Code School is cool for other languages, too."""
"Helen Stacy you are brilliant,step by step psychoanalysis of those who ratify the Convention for the sake of it."
"Are you sure it has not downloaded to a location of which you are not aware?  You might try searching your computer for \ISLR First Printing.pdf\"" or \""ISLR_First_Printing.pdf\"".  I was able to download with FireFox in the usual way."""

It is a text file. You can use any text editor (e.g. notepad) or you can open it in R by selecting File | Open Script and you will see a display of all the .R files in your default directory. If the file is not in that directory you will have to navigate to it.
I am starting to understand how the progress bars work.
"For some reason, I was not able to download the book when I used chrome. I tried using firefox after reading Phil's comment and it worked."
"I picked up on that one too, did you also see the moderately high number of parliament members that are women? I also looked for the lowest risk, it was Greece. I don't know where the US falls in contrast."
"Very clear lesson, however the UN system is more complex than that."
"Just explored more EC2 also provide some free trials, hopefully this will work!"
"Hi I am a midwife practicing in the Texas Hill Country, before that I worked in Nonprofit Maternal-Child Health and have consulted for a few Nonprofits/NGOs in US reservations and various parts of the globe - I would like to be more involved in maternal health issues in developing countries"

"South Africa is acclaimed to have one of the best Constitutions in the world, especially Africa. Has the fact it is not a signatory affected safeguard of women's rights in South Africa?"
"Well, coaches are generally focused on improving athletic performance and not the effects of exercise on aging.  Some exercise scientists may be coaches, so then it's an assessment of the individual's expertise."
"Hello All,"
Alcohol makes your blood vessels dilate and bring more warm blood from your core to your skin's surface. Alcohol also [lowers the temperature at which your body will begin vasoconstriction][1]   which means that you get cooler before starting to keep blood out of your legs and in your core.  
Hi Jessica!
"To paraphrase a favorite writer/thinker/teacher of mine -- Marion Woodman -- the out-of-balance patriarchy that has, out of still-existent tribalism and its fear of change, been as damaging for men as it has for women -- in different ways of course -- because it robs them of their central humanity which involves skillful providing and protection."
"My husband and one of my friends is like this.  I travel with my own, portable furnace. :)"
"You should probably be able to do this yourself, if not already certainly following section 3.R's video. As such I won't explain the code and what it does (watch the video and go through the R Lab in Chapter 3)"
"Hello, "
The UK signed CEDAW in 1981 and ratified it in 1986.  The state is therefore legally bound to implement the provisions of the Convention (even if this does not always happen in practice).  
"Hi Bev, The concept of divorce or separation is not straight forward and easy in most African cultures, and even then women's ability and capability to tell the man to get out or simply just leave is just an appendage. Unlike in the West, marriage in Africa is a communal affair, regardless on the socio-economic strata of the couple. Often men are the ones who seemingly have a right to kick the wife from home and return her to her parents/ relatives home. Most husband will demand refund of dowry should the wife leave for divorce by which time her family will not be in a position to refund and hence the pressure to stay on."
"This is probably covered someplace, but I can't find it.  Sorry!"
"I don't think \all hope is lost\"", it is just that the interpretation of the coefficients in the case of multiple covariates that are correlated becomes more difficult. Hence in that figure, subsets regression and the LASSO are consider more interpretable than the OLS method, as these methods aim to remove some of the predictors (or reduce their effects) giving fewer \""things\"" to consider at once."
"Again, I was very encouraged to see the WHO's wide definition of women's health and the particular and general problems that they face.  This serves to actively reinforce CEDAW and put it into action in a concrete way.  It  needs to be utilised to mobilise support for the actions recommended by the WHO so that all nation states ratify CEDAW and abide by the obligations stipulated within."
"I have been using EC2 recently to process machine learning algorithms for a Kaggle competition. It takes a while to get the hang of, but is very handy and a good learning experience. I would check the pricing on the Amazon Web Services website, tho. Certain, configurations might be $4.00 an hour, but I have been using a m3.2xlarge instance (8 CPUs 30GiB memory) for at most $0.90 an hour. Less ($0.20ish an hour) if you use spot instances for the same box."
How do you unenroll from this course?
nevermind found it under the bashboard
"<redacted> The courses uses \linear regression\"" and \""linear model\"" interchangeably. Also, re your point about not reading the course text, it *is* the course text and the video material can't possibly cover all of the things relevant to the course."
"I just received a confirmation from SCPD that my assignment was accepted. I think there may be a bit of a manual process to ensure your submission was acceptable, i.e. has cover sheet and is legible, so there is a delay between submission and confirmation."
"Hi, What do you think about diet and aging? "
"My country made a reservation about family name. I'm not even surprised, during the vote for the same sex marriage law, some are standing against it (:/) and are opposed because they don't want to have to take the woman name..."
let us know :)
"Repuplic of Korea has signed the treaty in 1983 and ratified in 1984 with the reservation of article 9, sup-paragraphs c, d, f, g of paragraph 1 of article 16. It withdrew most of the reservations in 1991 and in 1999 thanks to modifications in relevant international and domestic laws except article 9, which conflicts with domestic laws regarding children following their fathers' family name and married women being registered in their husbands' families. But I think there has been some progress in that because I hear that now people can choose between their father's and mother's family names. During my research I could see that the committee created by the CEDAW is very active, and the policy of having NGOs to send in shadow reports is effective - I could see a lot of women NGOs reports on the assessment by the CEDAW committee and their shadow reports. The main organization that works for gender equality in Korea, however, I think, is not CEDAW but another ministry under the president that concerns gender issues and family issues, although the department is not the most popular organization in Korea. :)"
"HI Anne,The non-ratification of CEDAW by the USA,to me  appears not genuinely an issue of their insistence that the  US supreme Court and their Constitution being superior but a strategic latitude to turn a favorable blind eye to non-implementing developing countries.Could it be a conspiracy between Investors from developed Countries(They have the clout by the large donations and sponsorship to political parties and presidential,congressional candidates)and the investors in developing countries to whom they trade with and outsource to hence corrupting/pressurize their Governments to ratify Conventions,yet both parties are aware of the inabilities  to implement and monitor the same.Purpose:to prevent adverse public boycotts of their products at home for Trading with non-Ratifying countries,black mail the producers to sell to them at the lowest price hence encouraging Women Rights abuse in those countries including forced underpaid WOMEN and CHILD labor working in inhuman conditions,while the developed countries retain the capacity to deny awareness of such malpractices,apologies to its customers for the oversight and laying the blame solely on the once overzealous,favorite trading partner?."

Greetings from the States I agree with the code and am excited to be studying with everyone!
"Just an addition to what's already been said: I think that if you work for a social justice organization, and specifically talk about your work as \rights based\"" then you link your work to the legal framework that already exists (either in the international community, or because your government has signed or ratified a specific convention/document). This means that you can use this established and recognized legal framework to hold your government accountable (if they've ratified it) to what it has agreed to do. Not only does this perhaps set a tone of urgency to the issue at hand, but it also compels the government to act. In that way your organization can \""help\"" or force your government to deliver on the rights that it has signed/ratified. There is a perspective of accountability. But I think the aforementioned example given by aparnaj was really interesting to read as it explains how the developmental argument can really make more sense in some places, than a rights based one. This was eye opening to me, thank you!"""
"I agree with jond. You have to do work that is capable of stressing your body near VO2 max to have improvements. You should feel very out of breath  within 1-2 minutes of working at VO2 max, and usually involves power output that can be maintained for only a few minutes."

How can one find out whether Australia ratified their agreements. They did not ratify their agreement made in Beijing on women's rights.
Ironic how Mexico ignores the femicides in Ju¨¢rez but manages to sign and ratify the CEDAW without any observation.
"I started a movement in Mexico, a condom delivery service. It has been a big deal to me to work on the field of HIV/AIDS prevention in a country where one of the biggest barriers is the cultural one. Getting to separate the moral and the clinical is very difficult. I believe the same thing happens in the majority of the countries but it is possible to achieve change. Technology had been our biggest ally to reach half of the population, and the other half (the half that cannot access to technology) is the most difficult to reach but again, we're passionate to do so. We are working 24/7 to achieve our first goal, to donate the 1% of the condoms that the government donates but in a metric-based, smart, follow-up way. I believe small efforts with smart applied resources will change the world as long as they're scalable."

There are groups of women trying to get it passed in the US but as long as the Tea Party holds a gun to the Republicans heads nothing progressive will occur.
"Hello! One of my favorite courses in grad school was Gender and International Development, where we studied the differing impacts of economic development policies on women. I am excited that this course focuses specifically on health. I have been out of school a while, but I am trying to maintain my critical thinking and reading skills. Looks like this online course will be a fun challenge! "
"That formula was started by Johnny G of the Johnny G spinner fame in the 1980's.   As a point of reference, if you used that formula, or, any of the others, most athletes are operating in their running formula, about 10 - 15 BPM higher than their cycling effort/speed, though Borg's Rate of Perceived Exertion may appear to be the same.  In other words, to equal the HR on  the bike to that on the run, you have to push even harder."
I found the whole interview very interesting. And even went and looked at internship opportunities on the Global Justice Center website. 
"Hi Everybody! My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I was referred to this class by Midwife International, an organization that promotes holistic maternal/infant health and midwifery education. I just completed a year overseas with them addressing women's health issues specific to midwifery in Uganda, Cambodia and Guatemala. What a year! I am also an OB nurse and I'm fascinated by just about anything that pertains to infants and women in the childbearing year. I'm exciting about digging into everything this program has to offer and hearing all the different perspectives!"
"Please tell Agnes how inspiring she is! I'm 50 and recently began to run again after a couple of years of being chained to my computer for about 45 hours a week.

I think the questions are defined a bit ambiguously. This question asks us to find a range of acceptable values for the slope. It does not actually specify if we use a one-sided interval or two-sided one. You would have to know that parameters of linear model follow a normal distribution.
"I really loved this interview because it helped me see how sexual violence is a weapon. I had never heard it called a weapon of warfare and I find it incredibly accurate. Like Akila was saying, the threat of sexual violence is used against people--primarily women but men experience sexual violence as well--in order to move people or get victims to do what perpetrators want them to. I also thought the idea of \bodily integrity\"" is really important to understand when discussing women's rights. Overall, I found this video extremely informative and enlightening!"""
"Yeah, the lack of representation of women in our government is embarrassingly low. And I think it's really important to analyze what makes the US a \developed\"" nation and still have such high rates of gender inequality, whereas other \""developing\"" nations seem to show more of an effort to include/involve women in their country."""
"Hello <redacted> <redacted> and greetings to Joyce, with thanks for her reference to Marion Woodman.  Yes, <redacted> <redacted> you raise some very complex and difficult questions, and I scarcely know where to begin.  First, I would like to say that discrimination against women in its many forms affects women in all countries.  This course happens to focus on women in \developing\"" or \""resource-poor\"" countries.  But such issues as violence, reproductive freedom, and economic independence affect women in all countries, certainly including \""richer\"" countries.  Having said that, we wonder where this discrimination came from and how these outrages can be addressed successfully.  Culture is strong, and men's dominance over women seems to be universal.  And yet we do see changes on an individual level and in some societies as access to education increases and an ethos of peace becomes more acceptable and accessible to people.  Through my concern with violence (teaching the course at Stanford), I came to be increasingly interested in non-violence, love, and compassion.  And I now think that if enough of us insist on doing things differently and not accepting violence as an acceptable strategy, then things can change, perhaps in small ways at first but more extensively as time goes on."
"Hello bissmeyele:  As I say at the beginning of the week on education (starting this Friday, California time) people are always asking me what is the \magic intervention\"" that will make the most impact.  Often people believe that \""education\"" is that magic intervention, and it certainly is important.  But in your question you ask about steps and actions.  I strongly believe that \""what\"" we do may be important but that the \""way we do it\"" is more important.     In my experience, \""successful\"" programs are almost always those that not only do good things but also do them with trust, respect, compassion, evenhandedness, and kindness.  There are lots of good interventions.  In my view, those that are not just good but \""transformative\"" always include at base a conscious attempt to act in the context of principles like those I just listed."""
Hi <redacted> <redacted>:
"As a single mother, I was interested in the statistic that \in many countries more than 30% of households are headed by single females.\"" Previously, I had never even questioned the enormity of single-mothers in today's society, but now that I have the numbers staring me in the face, I feel conflicting emotions. First of relief, that I am in a large group of women who can empathize and relate to my point of view. But the second is that of sadness, because many of these women face the stark realities that come with single-motherhood: isolation, poverty, judgement (especially when they have children outside traditional wedlock) etc. I have been an advocate for human rights of all degrees for a long time now, and am excited to be in a community of fellow learners desiring to educate ourselves further of the injustices women face daily around the world."""
"Hello there from Barbados. I graduated with a BSc in Chemistry but in my time at university, I became interested in Gender Studies and took quite a few courses. I have also become involved in NGOs in my country which focus all gender issues which include domestic violence, human rights and women's political participation. I must say that after reading these few pieces from the book, I am intrigued and I am ready to read and learn a lot more. For me, nothing makes it more realistic until I see data and figures and I can also say from this data sheet, I am neither impressed or surprised. However, in the next few weeks, I will like to learn a lot more about the upcoming topics and share what knowledge I have."
 I am interested as well - <emailRedac> Thanks.
"Thank you for your thoughts on this subject. I agree with you. Though as humans we have a right to *emotions*, we must think long and hard as to whether our actions that are linked to those emotions are detrimental to ourselves or others. \Consenting sex\"" within the sex industry is a shady, gray area. "
"I'm really excited about taking this class.  I just graduated from a women's college (Mills in Oakland, CA) and have really missed being able to read and discuss issues like the one's that were discussed in the prologue.  I'm really looking forward to this class because it touches upon a lot of subjects that are important, but unmentioned."
I love that quote.  Thanks for sharing!!!   I turn 60 next week and just had a bone density test 2 days ago.  I was thrilled to learn I am still in the normal range with my bone which I attribute entirely to my work out program!  Exercise - it really works!
"I wouldn't simply call prostitution a \degrading lifestyle.\"" Supply does not succeed without demand. Though as humans we have a right to emotions, we must think long and hard as to whether our actions that are linked to those emotions are detrimental to ourselves or others. \""Consenting sex\"" within the sex industry is a shady, shady area."
"Reading the Prologue through the lens of my experiences as Women¡¯s & Gender Studies (WGS) graduate student and feminist scholar at the University of Northern Iowa, what stood out for me was the importance of including gender based inequalities in the research and discourse of public health.  Being in WGS, many of the issues raised in the section, Turning a Blind Eye to Key Issues, are discussed in this field of study.  However, when I depart from WGS, women are no longer the subject, but are the other as noted in the textbook for this course.  When women become the other, their unique experiences and knowledge become marginalized.  Within the context of research and textbooks, women are lucky to have a section focused on them¡ªwomen are literally in the margins of the text and research. "
Thank you very much Sally!

Hi everyone! I am a fellow classmate from Southern California. It is amazing to see so many people from all over the world who are interested in women's health and human rights. I look forward to sharing this wonderful learning experience with you all!
Also very close to my heart. I lived in Phnom Penh for a couple years and will be returning for a short visit in a couple week. I've been reading all the news reports that are so disheartening. What makes it worse is that Cambodia is part of the UN. I wonder how many other countries are part of it in name only...

"Hi to all,"
"Canada has signed CEDAW,although there are many women's right issues in Canada, particularly among indigenous populations. Now pertaining to question two, there are objections. "
"I agree with you. Here in Egypt, awareness campaigns addressing women's rights often focus on women, and neglect educating men. However, we won't see any root changes until the mindset of men too is changed. Many men in countries like India, Pakistan and others (including Egypt) may beat their wives just to prove that they are men enough in front of their families. Women can be often vulnerable in a society controlled by men, thus young men should be educated into becoming protective of women and their rights, and supportive partners instead of becoming the very cause of the threat. I'm a budding feminist but i disagree with many feminist organizations that tend to blame men rather than educate and engage them. Some men are bad and abusive individuals by nature, but many others are just uneducated men who grew up in societies teaching them that women are their properties,that battering a woman is ok to teach her a lesson, and that a woman's role in life is only exclusive to household duties and childbirth."
I'm also excited to join and learn in this community!
Hi. My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I am a midwife from Australia.  I first became interested in the plight of women years ago while working in remote Australia and seeing women often with poor physical and mental health spend weeks away from country and family to await the birth of their baby  in larger centres. In more recent years as a volunteer midwife in Papua New Guinea I have been saddened at the plight of women there but amazed at how stoic and uncomplaining they are. This course will be so informative and also put me in touch with like minded people who want to make a difference to those less fortunate.
Awesome plot! would you mind posting the code to recreate something like this?
"I think You can increase the efficiency of the heart m¨²sculo with training, actually there is a way to measure that, the resting heartbeat per minute, trained athletes go below 60 beats per minute or less compared to an acerare person with 70-80 bmp. Actually as a general rule of thumb if a person has a resting heart rate per minute above 80 bpm, its a initial sign of heart condition."
"Reading the World's Women and Girls Data Sheet helps me to recognize how fortunate I am to have grown up in a developed country as a middle-class American. Although we have a lot of work to do in terms of human rights and women's health, we are much further along than other countries. I really did get the luck of the draw to be born here as a female. Since our culture is so oversaturated with messages all of the time, international women's health and human rights does not tend to be at the forefront of our minds. Many tend to turn a blind eye to what is happening in the rest of the world. I graduated from the Feminist Studies program at Stanford, and while that still drives my work in education, I am even guilty of losing touch with things that I used to know and feel passionate about. I'm hoping in this course to rekindle some of that fire and reconnect with my Stanford Feminist Studies roots."
"Hello Ischracs, I understand where you are coming from. But yes women, especially those that have accepted violence and abuse as the norm, maybe due to their upbringing, cultural or religious expectations need a shift in their thinking. It is one thing for someone to treat me badly as a woman, but when I see it as something I deserve, or something is not applicable to me only, then it is more of a self worth issue."
"Hello, "
"I can't believe that it wasn't until the 1990's that people started talking about women's rights as human rights. Women are human after all. It goes to show that we still have a long way to go before women can truly be respected and treated with the dignity that all human beings deserve. My favorite concept from these readings is that human beings deserve equal access to food, water, homes, healthcare, and well being just for being human."

"For time management purposes, it would be very helpful if there was a summary page for each week's work. Example:  Reading, pages x-x; Video 45 minutes, *etc*.  As the course is set up now, it requires me to click through each side tab to get an understanding of the work  so that I can plan the work each week. It is just a little annoying. Maybe such a page exists and I have not navigated to it as of yet. If yes, please describe where it is. Thank you."
Thank You!
I really enjoyed this bonus. It was very interesting and complementary to the other lecture included in the course. 
By random chance (pun intended) I found an open text-book (on machine learning) here:
"All human rights law have a long long history of unequal distribution between countries, and even within countries. But I can't help but feel that the distinction between social rights and civil rights is extremely artificial, and really a reflection of historical power struggles, as mentioned by Helen. So then why do we continue to use the language of seeing them as different kinds of rights, when in fact these things never neatly fall into categories like this. Does it not just normalise the kind of thinking that implies economic and social justice issues like poverty, health and education come after civil political issues in degrees of importance."

There are many many actors at national level (NGOs, civil society organisations etc) that are working hard on these issues. What I was just trying to say is that is not only because a country has signed and ratified a convention that the outcomes have to be taken for granted. And also that Western countries are in a better position for actually being able to sign such conventions, compared to developing countries, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there will be concrete improvements. Anyway, I agree that it definetely is a good thing that Italy has signed them, and I am very proud of it!"

My country signed without making declarations or reservations the CEDAW Convention in 1980.
Hello everyone!  My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I'm from Canada and am really excited to take this course and learn along with you.  As a woman it tears at my heart the negativity and abandonment women in other countries are suffering from.  
"Last week, I heard a news report about yet another woman in India who had been gang-raped. What was especially horrific about this case is the fact that the elders of her community ordered the rape, all because she was in love with a man of whom they did not approve. To make matters all the more disturbing, the women in her community were siding with the men who sent down the order, NOT with the victim. I read the PRB data while this story was fresh in my mind, and it suddenly occurred to me that in some cases, women may not only behave according to the expectations of the men in their lives but might actually possess a deeply embedded belief system that does not allow for individual thought. This may be true even when it comes to crimes against their own family members and friends."
"Spending a good amount of time working with groups focused on rehabilitating the lives of women after they have broken free from sexual enslavement, I have been aware of the United States' hesitation when it comes to signing human rights treaties, but I was unaware that we have yet to sign the CEDAW or the CRC. This seems an incredibly ignorant, as well as arrogant decision on America's part."
I'd be interested in knowing that as well!
"Mexico signed the CEDAW on 1980 and ratified it on 1981, with a declaration"
"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland signed CEDAW in 1881 and ratified it in 1986. UK has added many reservations over time as and when domestic laws were changed. One reason for the lengthy declarations and reservations may be due to the number of overseas territories that have their own laws but where there maybe a former colonial relationship with the UK, therefore this needs to be included in the document. It is also the case that the home nations (Scotland, Wales, NI and England) have varying legal systems. For example, Scottish law is quite separate to that of England and Wales, however, the UK government which holds responsibility for international affairs is that which ratified the treaty. Scotland will soon vote on a referendum to regain sovereignty in which case I very much look forward to Scotland signing and quickly ratifying CEDAW."

"The human rights approach is essential to women's health but it is a very difficult sell (so to speak) to policymakers and leaders in developing countries who are mainly interested in economic development. This is not an indictment on the character of these persons but rather comment on the assimilation of a human rights approach into local cultures. In many cases a woman's rights are viewed through a lens of economic development and the woman becomes a means to an end. Nations create work opportunities for women which are part time, unskilled, low paying, in hazardous environments or even create underemployment simply to meet international pressure to provide work. In the some cases of women's health may not be viewed a fulfillment of a right to access quality care but rather as a means of limiting associated to a social 'ills' or financial inconveniences. I think this is because the health issues of women are still viewed as the concerns of an 'other': concerns of persons outside the realm of concern and control of persons with power (more often male, older, non poor). Working in women's health requires advocacy which targets changes in cultural perceptions of women's issues. To a certain extent the domestic violence data showing women being more supportive of GBV is not surprising to me. In many (not all) situations where women are abused, there is an underlying culture of abuse as an acceptable form of social interaction and sanction which transcends women's issues. It is no coincidence that many of the societies which neglect women's issues also have problems stemming from cultural norms which have entrenched the either/or paradigm. The human rights approach must move beyond policy strategies and and conceptually isolated programmes to become cultural movements.    The success of the groups identified depends on their and their allies capacity to positively affect local cultures."

As a native of a post-colonial country I have to concur with the notion that countries sign on and ratify treaties without being fully equipped with the resources to well 'cash them out.' This has proven to be particularly true with developing countries that have signed on to IMF agreements and therefore have to shift the country's economic focus from nation building to debt repayment.I am however very proud that Jamaica did ratify the treaty in 1984 and continue to make strides towards the realization of the rights of women. Of course things are indeed  very very far from perfect but I am very pleased that we took the initiative.

I was excited to find out about this course and to learn more in depth about these issues.

Improving the quality of life for half the world's population will not only benefit everyone (a development issue), but it is the right thing to do."""
Greetings everyone. I am so glad I discovered this course. I am starting a few days late but hope to catch up with you all. I agree with the code and look forward to interacting and learning from everyone.
"I thought the readings would be like the readings for most of my classes, we would read about all the upsetting things happening in the world and at the end of the semester it would be like and here is what you can do. However, I love that at the end of the chapter it talks about the things that women are doing for themselves. I feel like being from the U.S. I have been taught that it is my job to help, but I found it inspirational that these women aren't waiting for help, they are helping themselves and their community. I am still growing and trying to be less ethnocentric and this totally just hit me. I am truly inspired by these women and I can't wait to learn even more from groups of women like the ones written about in this chapter."
"I am often struck by the 'otherness' of women and the reading confirms what I've noticed coming particularly from a political perspective regarding human rights.  The fundamental question that gets overlooked is are women human?  If we are to appeal to the men in power \by reason of our common humanity\"" we must change the current paradigm of women as other and less than.  To struggle against the current global social epidemic of violence against women I think we must bring the silent, private and in the home violations of human rights against women into the public sphere.  I am so happy there are many women activists around the world doing this!  I hope to be one of them soon."""

"I started winter swimming in the UK last September. My goal was to see whether I could acclimatize gradually by swimming in a lake twice a week. As the water got colder through the season, my swimming distances and times decreased. It's now 4C/43F and I swim once or twice a week anywhere between 10 to 20 minutes. My swim speed is also much slower in cold water than warm water. I train in the pool weekly and it's definitely easier. As the season has progressed, the water and air temps have dropped to winter levels. Gradually, my shivering response has decreased too. It's less violent and doesn't last as long. Proves that acclimatization works. My cold shock response has also adjusted. I used to gasp and be short of breath when I got in. Now I just walk right in and swim away. The course material helped me make sense of a lot of what I've experienced. That said, I am be very careful with cold water. I always swim in shallow water with someone so I can 1) step out quickly if I get too cold, 2) get assistance if needed. Starting in a bathtub sounds like a good idea. Good luck and stay safe!"

"While reading \Woman's health,Poverty and Rights\"" I have thougth about Nancy Krieger, from the harvard University. She gave us the \""embodiment\"" concept. That means that our health is the result of the social, politic and economic context, even before getting born. Being indigenous female in guatemala is not the same that being a nurse women in Canada. That means the inequalities are the result of where you are born, where you live, your socioeconomis status and other factors"

"I think it's not so much as being awful parents or not having brains, but overwhelming pressure and shame brought upon to women who bear female children.

Several years ago I worked with a young Indian girl in a hospital in a large US city. She was in high school when she started and we developed a good relationship as she moved on to a community college to work toward a career in nursing. On her 18th birthday her parents announced that they had found a husband for her and they would all be travelling to India within the year for her wedding to this young man. Through the year she and I talked often about her upcoming wedding. She was excited but nervous. She had only been to India once before as a small child. How could she let her parents choose a husband for her, I asked. What if she did not like him? I had LOTs of questions. She was just a little older than my oldest son and I could no more imagine picking a wife for him than fly. Nor could I have been comfortable marrying someone my parents had picked for me, especially sight unseen. Though a little worried, she assured me that this was their culture and in their culture daughters trust parents to find a suitable husband for their daughter. She placed a huge amount of trust in her parents that they were choosing wisely and in the end the story is happy. She is married to a fine young man and they have at least 3 small beautiful children. This is a happy story about how even though this girl was raised in the US with all the cultural \benefits\"" of a US teenager, she still followed her parent's culture into marriage but it illustrates how firmly some stick to what has been part of their culture for many, many years. She was a little disappointed that she would not get to date, have a boyfriend, and maybe even kiss a boy who would not end up as her husband but she wanted to honor her parents. I am glad we had the conversations and really glad that she felt comfortable to share her story with me. It gave me a better understanding of a practice that I thought so foreign. I still won't pick my sons' wives, but I understand why my friend allowed her parents to chose her husband. The issue of perpetuating violence through generations is much more complicated but if you take the premise down to it's very base, maybe you can understand how cultural influences, in some countries, are so strong and hard to break out of.

"My Uncle Rick <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, went to two Olympic games, 1972 and 1976 for swimming. He won 4th and 3rd respectively in the 200 breast. He continues to break world records at the masters meets and masters national events, however he must regularly have paddle electrodes (a defibrillator) used on him in order to bring his heart back into proper rhythm. He says he can feel when the beat speeds up irregularly, with the beat speed changing typically while at meets and thus he knows when to have his wife (a nurse) shock him or get to a hospital. Any suggestions, or ideas? He is in better shape than any athlete I know, and we have no past records of Heart disease in the family. "
"Hello,  Seems President Obama is agreeing with many of the issues you have mentioned during his  SOTU speech, particularly what is fair anf just for women....

"The data show that more women than men in the cited countries agree that \wife beating is acceptable\"" if the \""wife argues with her husband\"" and \""refuses sex with her husband\"". They reveal how much more deeply women in these countries - compared to the men - have internalized the gender norms of their societies, and how other factors such as lower level of education and lack of access to information kept women from questioning these norms, and their lack of agency further prevents them from transforming their views/attitudes about women's and men's entitlement. An important implication is to further the work of empowering women through education, access to economic resources, community and political participation, among others, to enhance their self-worth and their awareness of human rights. This is particularly an urgent and serious task if we recall that in most societies, women continue to be the purveyors of culture to the succeeding generations. I have come across studies such as in Lao PDR where the same attitude pattern was found among young people in regard to wife beating."""
"One can say a lot on this subject. I personally have found that in fighting weight gain, i 1) stopped looking ad adds, for they gave me a really bad feeling about how I looked, I felt fat even though I was not. 2) listening to my body AND eating healthy (sometimes when you crave fries, your body really does need fat, so eat a bit more (healthy) fat than you usually do). 3) stop feeling guilty or ashamed about your eating 4) by far the most powerful change in eating: feel grateful for your food, living beings gave up their life to feed you and I really think that is something to give thanks to."
"I feel pretty much the same way, although I think that the reservations of the US have less to do with our struggle to come to terms with the fact that a woman has a right to do what she wishes with her body and more because we, as a country, don't see ourselves as part of the world that we most definitely live in. It's some of that residual and daily xenophobia that's just engrained in our society that I find particularly taxing."

"Reading this chapter, I realized that a mentality shift or perception shift is key in assessing the effects of extreme poverty while drawing up solutions to combat this inequality.  The need to be more wholesome in analysis is a better way or lens to look through while approaching and discussing some of these extreme living conditions."
I was thinking the same and figured you could generate an auto-correlation plot of the time series to determine at what lag time the correlation tends to become small.  The acf function in the stats package will do this in R.  I would think you could use this as a starting point for a decision on how big of a block size to use.  One could then bootstrap this to fine tune as you should bootstrap any decision you make using the data.  Presumably a proper/best accounting of temporal auto-correlation would result in a smaller test error rate (?).

"Very interesting discussion. I should not be surprised that the \bully\"" nation of the United states has not signed on to the covenants related to women and children. It is astounding that the US sees their sovereignty above everyone else. Is it not the US who is always pushing other countries on their human rights issues?

Good questions.  I kind of think that explicitly stating groups whose human rights are protected in the text limits it more than broadens it.  We face this problem with what type of discrimination is illegal in the US today.  Sexual orientation is not listed but if it wasn't explicitly unlisted it would have to be included.  Or maybe it wouldn't... Or the court would have to decide and set precedent. Is this what you meant?
I could not agree with you more!

"Fascinating to hear how the political philosophy or ideology of our country has dictated our movements in the international sphere ( and holds us back in so many ways).

Insinuating that those that have abortions ¡ª for whatever reason ¡ª don't deserve to be parents or that those who prefer sons to daughters are people \without brains in their heads\"" is quite short-sighted, in my opinion. To think so lowly of other people, I think, reflects an inability to see the larger cultural and systemic issues at play in these situations. Things like sex-selective abortion or infanticide don't happen because a couple or a woman is a Very Bad Person, they happen because of prevailing cultural and social norms that make people feel unable to make other (arguably better) choices. I want to challenge the other students in this course to see those living with with sex preference as a daily reality with empathy -- as victims of a harmful, woman-hating system -- rather than with disgust or judgement."""

"I like your accounting of variance. I do not think that the blocking is trying to break the auto-correlation though. I think it is actually trying to preserve it. If you want to break the correlation you would want to sample in intervals not blocks. This is a common trick when doing Bayesian statistics, say, where you want the auto-correlation of the MCMC chains to bounce around 0. I think that whatever model you are bootstrapping still needs to take a proper accounting of auto-correlation though and failure to do so, as you suggest, would result in elevated standard errors."

Hi Tamara
"I found the anecdote from the Global Fund for Women meeting held in 1992, which can be found on page 9, to be a particulary thought-provoking one. It invites reflection on the global consequences of national responses (or lack thereof) to international agreements. We see this dynamic at work in myriad ways in the area of global climate change. However, less attention is paid to the way in which local, national, and regional actions have global impacts on different populations of girls and women. It is a reminder to us all that the local is global."

"Chapter 1 of From Outrage to Courage highlights the distance still needed for our women to access basic health interventions and education. I am very aware of most of the issues highlighted and some legislations which are in place to assist to alleviate some of the issues. However for many of these legislations to have positive impact the need for enforcement of these legislations should be of great importance. We also have to understand the socialisation of many of us, that is the acceptance of patriarchy which is  fully accepting that only men have the capacity to lead. Many nations have maintained the traditional norms of the society, justifying the subordination of women to the private space of the home and the roles of the men are that of public leadership taking decisions which impacts on all of the society. So issues relating to reproductive health, domestic violence, education and employment of women are not viewed as priority issues as \a woman's place is in the home\"". We see worldwide many agencies are now trying to address some of these issues, but there are limitations to the impact, as many are grossly under funded. However as women we have to continue our focus on education, especially using informal educational methodologies to encourage all women, especially those who have not gotten or have limited formal education to participate in any community based training. These techniques are needed because many women if invited to attend a training workshop will feel intimidated if they are of the opinion that they will be expected to read and write the information been imparted. I am aware that many organizations do use participatory learning methodologies, but I think on a global level many of us practitioners lack the skills to impart the health and human rights information in simple terms to our women, therefore this skill is needed to enable us to facilitate the relevant training towards women's empowerment."""
"What an enlightening and eloquently articulated interview. I agree with many other posters that the way Helen Stacy delineates human rights as an idea rather than existing phenomenon is eye-opening. It cut straight to the heart of uncertainty I felt when hearing phrases like \human rights are important to protect because it's the fair thing to do\"". Understanding that \""human rights\"" do not in and of themselves \""exist\"", and are an idea and ideal, supported and explained by specific covenants and declarations, has eased the discomfort of not knowing where human rights stem from and how they're supported. I now have a better understanding of the infrastructure, both internationally and within local governments, that have been created to support the protection and execution of the ideal of human rights. "

It should be the summation of the square. Check out the chapter on the Lasso.
"I am a US citizen and my country has signed but not ratified CEDAW. As a member of Amnesty International, I have been working to try to get the government to ratify this for many years. As a nurse midwife, every day I take care of women who are discriminated against in so many ways. Lower wages than men, lack of control of their childbearing, economic hardship, lack of access to healthcare, transportation, mental health services, housing.... sounds like a developing country, doesn't it? It is the reality for many women in poor rural areas of the U.S."
I felt this was an excellent introduction to the topic and I am aware that we have a long way to go. I think there could be more emphasis on the fact that even the most developed and so-called 'progressive' countries have a long way to go.
"I worked in Guatemala during the civil war and noticed similar complaints from the women, who worked hard physically and were under much stress emotionally. They complained of headache and also 'me duele las canillas' (my shins hurt... I heard that all the time."
"I also found the \either/or\"" paradigm to be quite interesting. It makes me think of the \""us vs. them\"" mentality that seemed to spread rapidly after the 9/11 terrorist attack, targeting Muslims and immigrants in general. "
"I was pleased to get an overview on some of the women activist groups taking action around the world. I am curious to learn how these groups are supported within their country and how cultural values are taken into consideration. While women have been subject to human rights violations, I appreciate this intro recognizing the progress and continuing effort of women as active agents for their rights."
Carseats with a capital C.
Agreed! It is so moving to know that women around the world are taking control of their destinies and are helping each each other.  Another example of how we are all one!
I am. It stinks.
I'd like to ask what do you think is the difference between human rights not being real and human rights not being recognized and being unknown and violated. 
"I was also shocked to find out that the US restricts the procedure of abortions with their funding. It is so sad! It makes me wonder if the US government has an understanding of the long term effects such a policy has on women impregnated through rape. The effects of sexual violence are far reaching, affecting not only the woman, but her family, and community as well."
"I think you're right. For staff, this occurs at 8:03 min in module 9 of the aging videos. Thanks."
"What I enjoyed most about this interview was the discussion on language. Hearing that using certain words in school, like \I have a right not to be hit,\""  may not provide instant results, but will empower women to change a mindset that is limiting. As mentioned, India, a country that has signed CEDAW, does not have the access to provide census data for tracking human rights. This is why it is important to use a tool like language so that change begins by the grassroots and builds into a governing structure."""
"Well Ramesh, I'm with you. I hope someone can answer your question more fully as I had the same question."
"I am from the United States of America and according to the website, they have signed it but not ratified it. I am curious about that. It was signed in 1980 which is before a lot of what is considered modern day feminist theory came around. I think that maybe the lack of ratification has a lot to do with the fact that our country (although it is a more forward thinking country) is still run by older white males. The way they see equality towards women is very different than the \everyday\"" woman sees equality towards women. I think that our country still has a <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> way to go before it is a fully equal nation."""
"United States of America has signed but not ratified the CEDAW. We have also not written any reservations or objections to the document. After watching the video, I understand why the US hasn't ratified, but I'm surprised that so many other countries have so many objections and reservations to the document. It's like they can't agree with human rights without some sort of machismo comment."

"I always find it interesting and saddening to be reminded that the US has not ratified CEDAW and that it has been sitting there since Jimmy Carter was president. I also again goest to show just how powerful of a political force the conservative right wing party is in the United States. I agree that a lot of it is tied to the ideas that the U.S. does not want to be told what to do (soverignty), and that the underlying objection to CEDAW is the family values and anti-abortion agenda of the conservative right wing. However, I wonder if the underlying value behind that is really the concern of privileged white males losing their power and the \sytem\"" from which they benifit. Just a thought to mull over..."

"It was really interesting to hear Helen talk about how human rights don't exist in the way we think they do/ought to. They are an idea or ideal, and if one doesn't know about them, one doesn't have them. However, once a person does learn that they have rights, they come to expect them (in the home, community, from the government). Which is a very empowering thing. "
glad i'm not the only one! I had that problem too!
"I see what you are saying and I think it is easy to see the human rights violations when they are all around us but I also try to focus on all the women banding together across this world.  I believe our true human nature is not a static reminder of the past but is instead dynamic, evolving. The examples in Chapter 1 were an inspiring reminder of how much influence a person can have in this lifetime.  They can also provide guidance on how changes can be made.  Also, I was honestly surprised that there is so much discussion about sexual violence world-wide.  To me, that's really promising and it pushed me to remember that the work being done in my own community can make such a difference!"
"The United States is a signatory; however, it has not ratified CEDAW (as we learned from the interview with Helen Stacy). It was interesting to see how many reservations and objections that were posted by other countries. I suppose it all comes down to viewpoint... although one would assume in order for such a convention as CEDAW to be ratified in so many countries, the same general \big picture\"" would have to present for each nation to some degree."""
"Based on what we are learning.. I believe its safe to say that all of the MDG goals relate directly to girls education. In addition, goals 3,5, and 6 could be achieved if girls were further educated"
The United States signed but failed to ratify the treaty. The treaty was signed in 1980. Helen's thoughts were insightful as she re-framed my conceptualization of human rights.
"Wow. After reading everything, I feel a heavy burden. I have heard about some global women's issues, but when I look at the statistics, I am blown away by how drastic these issues are in certain places."
"After reading the prologue and looking at the data sheet, it goes to show how much harder we have to work to bridge the gender inequality. I am glad to see women striving   for the best yet, there are so many others who see this lifestyle as a normal. I say no to that! I look forward to reading more and learning about possible ways of making a difference."
"Hello all,"
"I disagree with this because traditionally, feminism only includes white women and those who aren't white are excluded. Where is the equality in that? How can a feminism starts in such an oppressive way and yet it has claimed to \protect\"" equality of all women? I think rights, regardless of sex,gender orientation, or religions, should be given and respect equally. Why are we fighting one another when we can use these time to build better societies? Why are we thinking that a certain skin color or race is superior than another?"""

"I think America is scared. They have run on patriarchy for so long that when a women, a strong women with potential to be leader comes along, they have the need to discredit her. I mean....look at what media is saying about Michelle Obama's and other women leaders' physical appearance instead of her accomplishments. On the flip side, look at what media is talking about men leaders. They are given credibility for works and not pressure to fit certain physical appearance.  Where is the equality in that?"
New Zealand signed CEDAW on 17/7/80 and it was ratified on 10/1/85.

"I wonder how much of increased physical activity actually contributes to increased self efficacy (i.e. being able to perform daily activities because of being healthy and fit), thus leading to lower depression and anxiety. In other words, exercise is not only contributing to physical and biological health but also psychological as well. And can women who are at higher risk of these debilitating mental illnesses benefit more from physical activity, thereby decreasing the number of women who need to be taken care of in older age - a problem mentioned earlier in module 2."

"This Chapter in a detailed way describes challenges and problems facing many societies in the world. Girls and women have been struggling to fight discrimination in all spheres of their lives. There has been numerous studies and approaches emphasises the importance of education since early age, with the focus on the increase of quotas for girls attending schools. Girls¡¯ and women¡¯s education is very important and crucial in the process of the empowerment and overcoming gender inequality. However, the mere increase in and quotas for girls attending schools, as just discussed, does not consider the quality of education or gender equality issues within education such as gendered books, gendered classrooms, and gendered teaching. (Jamilah Ariffin, ¡°Gender Critiques of the MDGs: An Overview and an Assessment¡±, International Council on Social Welfare (ICSW), August 2004)  Even though education is crucial and valuable for providing necessary tools for the empowerment of women, if there remain other factors that constrain women, then women will not, in practice have the freedom to implement and develop their capabilities. "

"I can only speak for Canada, but the anti-abortion movement here has been moving to limit access to abortion under the basis of \saving girl babies\"" and \""protecting them\"" against sex-selection. The basis for this push was from a poorly performed study out of a Toronto hospital that doesn't perform abortions reporting that women from Southeast Asia were marginally more likely to have boys in their third, fourth or subsequent pregnancies. Having worked with organizations in Toronto that work closely with immigrant women who are seeking reproductive health services, I can say that these claims are not a reality in Canada and I feel confident saying they are likely based in xenophobia. They came close to limitting access with these bills because they use feminist language and try to appeal to the left. Again, however, there has been no proof that sex-selection is happening on any statistically significant scale in Canada ¡ª but the anti-abortion movement has seen this issue as an \""in\"" to erode our currently very liberal abortion laws."""
"I also found this very surprising snd this shows how important education is, knowledge in deed is power and really save lives, the fact that a child whose mother who can read is 50 percent more likely to live past age 5 shows how important education is in the well being of any society and no female should be left behind."

"Hi, Australia has signed on to CEDAW on 17th July 1980 and ratified on 28th July 1983, with reservations around female participation in combat and paid parental leave.

"The goals that relate directly to girls' education are goal 2 (achieve universal primary education) and goal 3 (promote gender equality and empower women). As for which goals are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment, I would say that includes almost all of them. Extreme poverty and hunger will never be eradicated without education. While you can give handouts as charity to keep people from starving, if you want to end hunger and poverty in a sustainable, long-term way then you must educate people and teach them skills that will enable them to make their own living."
"I find your question really interesting and I would like to add to your thinking process by including TaiChi as a comparative to meditation. I have been doing TaiChi for a while now and also Kung Fu. While one is a highly cognitive sport with emphasis on concentration, the other is very phhysical and less cognitive. Both aspects cannot be seen separately though, as body and mind will always work together to achieve a goal."

"According to the paragraph Women¡¯s Groups Taking Action I just want to make you know the existence in Senegal of the Association of women working in the field of law and jurisprudence. As the access to legal counseling is quite difficult for poor and in particular for women (apart from the feminisation of poverty, analphabetism also is a big obstacle: according to 2011 national data 57% of women have no education level against 36% of men), the association offer free legal counseling in some of the most popular and poor districts of the capital. They also are involved in public advocacy in order to eliminate discriminations against women that still exist in legal codes such as for parental authority, access to land and resources and so on. This association contributed to the elimination of the law preventing the attribution of the nationality to children born from senegalese unmarried mothers in 2012. Their work is very important and it is recognnised by the Government. They managed to build a consensus on their work focusing in particular on human rights and promoting women rights as human rights. One of the themes that thay are now promoting is the law on the abortion, that is at present illegal, even in the case pregnancy may cause a risk for mother's health. They are part of a global net including associations all over the world."

"Mariyataher,that is a really good and thought-provoking point to bring up: \At what level is it acceptable to take cultural practices into consideration when talking about human rights.\"" I think this can be an issue that development workers face all the time when working within a culture that is very different from their own. As the reading mentioned, wealthy males were the first to define \""human rights.\"" What might have been a right to them, might still have excluded others. In the same way, many would view traditions that others practice as a violation of human rights, while those within their own community would not. When working with communities to address practices that we could see as harmful and a violation of HR, I wonder if we'd have to approach the practices from a different angle, and introduce them as a health concerns, rather than a human rights concern. It is a human rights violation, but addressing the practice to the community (any community) as a health concern might be more effective."
"I think the case can be made that all MDGS 1-7 are directly related to girls' education.  As demonstrated in the readings, it can be demonstrated that by educating girls, we can reduce poverty, reduce child and maternal mortality, reduce the number of HIV/AIDS infections (given the majority are among girls 15-24), achieve universal access to education, increase gender equality and empower women, and ensure environmental sustainability.  To me, it seems educating girls can in fact by the \magic\"" answer though it would need to be complemented with many other social, cultural and development interventions."""
"I would like to add another point to this delicate issue: it is how many languages do you actively use. It happens that I (over 50 ys) do not use any more my mother tongue, in my daily life communicate in another language, which I have learnt at 24 and constatly need to communicate at high level of efficiency and with ample vocabulary in a third one, i.e. English. All three belong to different families, therefore do not share more that their Indo-European origins.  Sometimes I feel like I have no language of my own, this so called \intelectual decline\"" in my case seems even steeper. I can \""feel\"" my brain is searching anxiously for a specific word and quite often the one which appears on the tip of my tongue is does not belong to the language I am writing or speaking in that moment."
"Great interview! I had no idea that women are purposely impregnated in parts of the world, and how becoming pregnant is one of the worse consequences because it's a proof that they were raped. Women should definitely have access and the option to have an abortion. I think it's sad that the United States will not fund services for abortion, for this creates a stagnation for women's health worldwide, and the right to choose. When the abortions *are* being preformed, I hope that the women have a certified, knowledgeable expert performing these abortions and that the women are treated holistically afterwards, with both mental and physical care. All in all, I think the Global Justice Center is doing a terrific and much needed job."
"I really appreciate that you see this as people looking for short, quick fixes rather than for a long-term and deep rooted change. However, I disagree with you on what this change should be. I don't believe that allowing abortions in areas of conflict is a means to lasting change. Akila said that when women are raped and become pregnant that many times they are thrown out of their communities and homes (which you mentioned). This being the case, I see the main problem as how the community is viewing these women and the intentional rape, as well as the resources available to these women when they have been ostracized from their communities from outside sources. Obviously one way to prevent all of this from happening is to change the thought of rape being \collateral damage\"" to it being seen as an intentional violence against women and a weapon or war. This is talked about in the interview. But, knowing it would be hard to create any laws against this that would actually be able to be enforced, especially during war-time, I think we must turn our heads then towards the communities that these atrocities are being committed against. By moving our focus to the communities and helping to shape the way they value human lives (even ones brought on by rape), as well as the lives of the mothers, perhaps we can stop them from being ostracized. We can also start to aid women who are being ostracized from their communities by providing medical support for her and the child, mentoring, micro loans so that she can start to fend for herself....etc. This I believe will prevent a long-term change in values, decisions, and treatment of women. I believe this in the end will be more beneficial and get more at the root of the problem than providing abortions in areas of conflict will."""
This was an incredibly informative interview. It's interesting the affect that international laws has on women's health and position in the world. It angers and frustrates me that the US has not signed the CEDAW. Signing the CEDAW would be a strong and open move in showing the global community that we are committed to ending female discrimination everywhere.
"I find these reading materials especially \A power of educating Adolescent girl\"" very useful and relevant to many developing countries particularity society where i come from. Poverty, bad traditions and cultural values are some of the main causes for girls dropout in Tanzania. In many rural settings (taking Maasai and Kurya tribes as examples), tradition practices of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and forced marriages are few causes that lead to girls dropout. If girls are protected from all these kind of practices which ruin their lives and subject them to severe poverty situations they will finish their education, increase number of literacy and rise the country economy."""
"I agree that much of the discussion on women's health worldwide is focused on their childbearing role, and less on their roles as acting agents in their societies. Hopefully in the coming decades this will change, and women will be viewed in a more holistic, healthy manner. I believe when this perception changes, greater, effective change will follow. I also appreciated the viewpoint that the Ghanaian women saw their health in a more day-to-day basis, rather than something to be viewed separately."
"Ow, what an amazing animation but here's my question... some of the girls that marry at their teens are born in countries in which those kinds of marriages are part of their culture, would you say that to make a change in that number you have also to make change into people's culture? Because I think that otherwise it wouldn't help or it wouldn't continue within next generations, if you don't change the root of thinking that creates that kind of behavior or am I being biased?"
"Lynn Murphy and the readings discussed the way schools/teachers/educational systems can reinforce stereotypes about women. In the US, it was found that when middle school girls were educated in single-sex science and math classrooms the girls outperformed or matched the scores of boys. When the girls were educated in coed classrooms, their math and science scores dropped. I am curious if there is any discussion in the international community about separate educational institutions for women?"

"Awe, I was under the false impression that we were further along with human rights on this planet than we truly are. Sad and discouraging but not a moment to quit wanting and moving forward. I have hated my county, the United States, for several years now and now when I get bent out of shape and share my hate with others I have some new examples now that I can add to any discussions that I have on the subject. I see the United States government as a poor example setting 'older brother'. Others may think he is cool and his words and actions to be an exhibit of how to carry oneself for acceptance, his ideas important and adhered to, but really he is just a punk. A clueless punk."
Hi:
"This reading was good because it raised very interesting things, with some of them I agree and with some of them I am a little bit sceptic... I found interesting some of the myths and facts descriptions, such as the importance of taking into account the data about non-formal education, that are not well collected, and not considering just formal education as the only one... Nevertheless, I don_t think the non-formal education is a widespread phenomenon and in case it_s, it would be interesting to know the gender gap between boys and girls (for example, coranic schools are usually just for boys...) and the quality and contents of this kind of education. An in depth research on this kind of information would be very, very useful."
"The 2 goals that relate directly to education are MDG2 (Achieve universal primary education) and MDG3 (Promote gender equality and empower women). The other 6 MDGs depend on educating girls for their fulfillment, as it has been mentioned before in the different readings and videos of the course that educating girls helps reducing maternal and child mortality, poverty, AIDS, and other diseases."
That took forever to get through who knew one country could have so many reservations.Both the UK and Pakistan have signed the CEDAW never thought the UK would have more reservations though.
Just ONE year of education can improve a girl's future in such profound ways... wow.

"I think you're absolutely right, Sabrina, it's pretty scary to think about how unrepresented women are at decision-making level. This is even more so the case when we think about the diversity of women, because we are clearly not a homogeneous group, and so how can we expect to be represented by a mere handful of women? I worry about this particularly when other identities, such as marginalized classes or races, intersect. The few women who *are* in parliament tend, by and large, to come from particular race and class backgrounds. There aren't many of them, and they're going to struggle to be heard and speak to the issues that *they* face - but what about the issues of women from different classes and different cultures?"

"There is another issue which needs to be considered. Adolescents in particular are influenced by the 'desirable' body image promoted n the media, and that image is much thinner than the figure which can be achieved by most people. In fact, with photoshopping it is much thinner than can be achieved even by the models. This is one of the drivers of increasing levels of anorexia in adolescents. On that basis, encouraging healthy levels of activity would be preferable to encouraging calorific restriction."
"The statistics in the infographic aren't new to me, but are staggering nonetheless. What I felt was absent from the readings so far is a specific focus on human right and justice. Much of the information still promotes education for girls from the perspective that it helps everyone and is good for physical health, the local economy, etc. I would be curious to see how a justice-oriented argument could be argued."
Sounds like the UK at the moment.

"Funny enough... I was born and raised in Russia, then spent a few years living in Phoenix, AZ. Being a pro-ballet dancer in both places. Even after YEARs in +45C heat, I was still able to do A lot more in the cold. But definitely able to tolerate more of both cold and heat."
"It is only a dream to those of us in the US to think of free healthcare and not having to pay for university. Our system is also set up, I believe, to favor those that can afford these things, which is part of keeping the poor down. Call me a conspiracy theorist if you will, but when only one segment of the population has the advantage, it is only through luck or incredible perseverance that the less fortunate get anywhere. I remember being treated appallingly when I was young and poor and could not afford healthcare for my children. There was no Medicaid system in my state that helped married people then; things have improved in that regard. This course is bringing back memories of so many injustices my family suffered as we were so poor. And the fact that I later became a midwife and was able to support my family well; this was only because a family friend gave me the money to pay for the course. I could not have gotten a loan (no credit rating) and to come up with the money myself was impossible. I think it is so wonderful that in most developed countries (and some less developed) health care and education are considered rights. That brings me to maternity leave, which is non existent for many of the women I care for, most in fact. But that is another conversation."
Siobhan I think your father was way ahead of his time.
"All of the goals relate to girls' education. Some are more obviously related than others, but as we have learned in the readings so far, educating girls leads to a host of improvements in quality of life within those communities and countries. To a certain extent, I would also say that all of these goals are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment. It is impossible to tease away the smalls parts that do and do not relate to this topic because it is so interrelated. None of these goals can be isolated completely from the others."
"Do we need to reserve a specific time to videoconference with TA or do we simply log in - if so, what is the process? What is best way to submit questions (for discussion) in advance of OH?"
"I agree, though the infographic doesn't take it from a justice standpoint, Anne definitely addresses that in the reading and likely goes further in to it. The book also uses other social factors that impede education specifically for women and addresses those from a justice standpoint. Like FGM."
There is no doubt that education plays a very important role in a person's life. No doubt at all!!!!

"That's a great question. I'm not one to typically label something as 100% good or 100% bad, and I think this is one of those cases.

It would also probably depend on the country's \status\"" on a larger scale and whether it is a large influence on others or not. I would also hope that countries looking to invest would take a deeper look into the actual practices and not just whether a country signed something."""

It sounds like R may have used the list type for data1[1] and/or data1[2]. What command did you use to read in the .CSV file? I'm guessing you used `read.table` or `read.csv`.

"A woman has the maximum impact on the social, economical decisions making in the family generally. At micro level, educated woman help in making the whole family including the older family members, understand the values and importance of education, and at macro level, educated women add to the social and economical development of the nation.Girls education is like sowing the seed which gives rise to green, cheerful and full grown family plant. Education for the girls is more important as she not only builds the home but all routine responsibilities are taken care of by her. An educated woman not only helps in nourishing the family in a better way but can also help in earning. Education for a girl child means making the next generation well educated, full of virtues, free from the useless superstitions, confident and capable to do something good for the family, for the society and for the country as a whole.

"Out of the 8 goals included in the United Nations' Millennium Goals, I would say that goals 2 and 3 most directly relate to girls' education. The second one states that it aims to achieve universal primary education, ensuring that every child--both boys and girls--have the opportunity to complete their standard education requirement. Meanwhile, the third goal strives to promote gender equality and empower women. This, without a shadow of a doubt, includes equal, undiscriminating, unsexist access to education. After all, education *is* the first step upon the path to a bright future. "

"Yes, I too agree. Now that India has a law on domestic violence and lot of research is taking place informing the progress of its implementation, I sincerely hope that this kind of dreaded situation will come to an end."
"Ideally, we should have a legislative and judiciary system that tackles the matters of violence and abuse reported by women in rural and urban areas but quite the contrary, the matter loses value when members of the society itself judge and broadcast via social media, presenting the women as culpable for the abuse they are victims of. This in turn, blows out whatever torch the government should bear for women in our society. I have read of many cases where women in Nigeria have actually demanded reprimand and justice through the law but they were ignored and mostly frustrated into accepting the status quo or deciding on something else more drastic for which she bears the responsibility/consequence. It is a shame!"

It is becoming more and more apparent that the gender gap is an ongoing problem and one that is not going to get better on its own. I could speculate on the reasons for our failure to ratify CEDAW, but the reality is that we are still very much a patriarchal society. To ratify would be to loosen the hold that the patriarchy has on our society and that is something that those in power just don't want to do. What is also of concern is that many, in fact I would guess that a majority of Americans are not even aware that this exists. Something not currently part of the public awareness, not currently captivating the population simply is not going to get attention from the legislature.

I agree that the questions touch a wide range of purposes and perspectives: 2.2R2 (the hupercube) may throw you off both with its purely mathematical formulation and by the fact that it calls for a purely quantitative approach. 2.3R1 on the contrary calls for a quasi-philosophical approach for the extreme conditions of a system (or that's the way i like to view it).

I particularly appreciated ¡°The Power of Educating Girls¡± point that while education can empower girls and bring about more equitable gender developments and progress, the way we educate girls also needs to be considered. As we know, education, as powerful as it can be, is not a panacea and multiple pedagogical approaches need to be considered if we truly want to impact and bring about change. How we teach is just as important as what we teach. The efficacy of education is to some extent contingent upon the method of its transmission and reception. "

"The one issue that I missed in Chapter 1 on Women¡¯s Health, Poverty and Rights, was the unpaid care work and its the connection to the time poverty and women¡¯s health. The unpaid care work, that was actually described, but not explicitely named, is a huge part of the poverty issue, and although according to the World Bank the experiences of the poverty are different at the sub-national levels in the countries _ it affects all women. In addition to the lower women¡¯s wages comparing to men, women have a huge burden of the household work from preparing food, to taking care of the members of the family. The unpaid care work and the time poverty has also a direct effect on women¡¯s health _ in poor countries, women have to carry water often from a large distances, young girls are dropping out of schools not getting proper education, because they have to help with the household, ÿetc. this time poverty keeps them from doing other activities that are available to men/boys, have a free time, and also it closes the door of education for them.

Great intro video... I am really looking forward to this section. I have so many people ask for advice in this area and really appreciate that this topic is a part of this course...
"Interesting observation, thanks!"
I could probably stand the spa treatment but I don't think I could manage 51 degree water even in a wet suit.  I've jumped into Lake Michigan in early summer when the water was chilly and thought my heart was going to stop. lol
"I misunderstood the question. Confidence intervals and standard errors make some strong assumptions about the data and about the true model. I would say low p-values (or small standard errors) are desirable, but the ultimate test of how well a model fits the data is to calculate the MSE of a test data set."
I agree. This is a very interesting possibility.
"While I have always had a vague sense of the disparity of access to education between the developed and developing world, this week's readings have really opened my eyes to how complex the problem is and how there isn't a simple solution to the issue. Simply offering educational opportunities to young girls doesn't eliminate a problem but introduces new challenges in terms of the type of education she is receiving and encouraging/supporting her as she makes her way into the system. There are far too many barriers preventing young girls from wanting to be educated, let alone addressing the financial problems that may prevent them from going to a school in the first place, whether it's the cultural discouragement by enforcing gender stereotypes in the system or lack of representation/role models for girls to look up to. I am happy to see that with the gains being made by getting girls to step through those school doors in the first place, there is a shift to focus on the quality of education. However, there is still much that needs to be done before these issues become a thing of the past."
"I've enjoyed each week of lectures. But I have to say, this week is the best yet. The amount of information in these lectures is fantastic and very accurate in disasters."
Hello Everyone! I am new to this topic so hopefully I can keep pace. I was horrified to learn of the statistics in the Data Sheet. It is very troubling to read that such large percentages of the populations in certain countries believe violence on women is acceptable. It is absolutely lamentable that in some of these countries women believe that this domestic violence is more acceptable than men. Those statistics are repulsive. It is wonderful that such an influential person like Anne Firth Murray is willing to lead a class for free.
"Christopher, "
"I am amazed at the quality of the online class structure so far. Really well done. Thank you for allowing this course to be accessible for free. While 100% interested in the content, I have realized an unintended benefit of this class. I teach at the college level, and would love to use this format to build an online class one day. Thank you for giving me inspiration! <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
Excited to be here and learn from everyone! I agree to the code of conduct as well.
"I have had the same questions KMaria.  All the responses are wise reflections from the culture/s we know, accept or appreciate. I believe culture is learn behavior and so we can recognize what is no longer satisfying about the culture that was once embraced and the evolution of change starts.  55 years ago the women who dared to challenge existing cultures were not supported by the majority of women.  But the change was going to come.  For us who feel \liberated\"" it seem easier to form the questions.  It is even good to have a male to discuss the questions with.  Because every story has 3 or more sides."
I wholeheartedly agree with these facts that education could vastly improve living quality. I was pleasantly surprised that these numbers/charts of improvement were greater when presented to me.
"It seems like these goals set by UN are very hard to achieve. Although they're very straightforward, they're also very intimidating to take on. Such as eliminating diseases like malaria and AIDS."
"It is impossible to be totally non judgemental as we are all influenced by our own experiences and upbringing and values from our own culture we are steeped in. We can still be non accepting of some pratices or values or actions, yet not be judgemental of other people thinking or where they are at in their lives, or places in society. It does not mean we should accept actions that are abhorent or inhumane and not speak against them."
"Hi,"
"I got a much better understanding of the various human rights declarations after watching this discussion. I particularly liked how Helen Stacey described the concept of human rights and how it is an idea which you as an individual, depending on your social and economic standing in the society, may or may not be cognizant of. It is encouraging to see that even though it is slow there is progress on the recognition of these rights by women and children and this gradually has the potential to bring about change. For obvious reasons most of the efforts are spearheaded by women but I would love to see more men talking about women's issues and rights. Hopefully we'll see some examples of that in the course as we move forward."
"From my observation a population of transgender is not growing...people with the gender identity were not allowed an identity for sometime and so existed in the established norms at the time. The times are changing yet many still struggle to get under a labelled group. Sensitization and awareness will help all of us to better understand how we do the right thing, recognize tolerance as BOTH ways and yes mutual respect"
"Hello, I am of Indian origin, living in Australia now. Anne Murray's book \From Outrage to Courage\"", just the introduction of it gave me an incite to this course we will be doing which I am sure will be very interesting and will broaden our knowledge of females in the poorer countries. "
I am very grateful that Corey is so cute !!!!
"Hi Heidi,"
"Hi,"
Thank you. What I meant video for download the same that are presented online -- currently the ones for download are so low quality that it is impossible to use them (any text is barely visible).
I recommend working through the questions at the end of each chapter of the textbook (both Conceptual and Applied) to provide that challenge
"Well done Cory that was really great! Your presentations were interesting, content rich and passionate and to be honest I was inspired. You also showed tremendous courage in doing it your way, which I thoroughly enjoyed, keep it up mate, you are a natural..."
The other way to prove this is to look at the two extreme cases:
"Respected Madam,"
I don't think you will be able to answer all questions based on just watching the videos. You also need to read the book
"Good point Shelley, really good point!!!! It should be reiterated that girls' education isn't a favor being done to girls, it is a right...and we should be careful like you've pointed out not to focus on how this helps economically but even physical health wise and mental health wise. There's so much to be done...and we will do it!!!"
THANKS...dyslexia strikes!  R
I am also very interested in exploring this ;-) 
Just thinking of keeping what I'm doing in harmony with my beliefs and allowing it to resonate with me makes me feel so much calmer. I know I'll have a better semester come this fall !
"While goal nr. 2 and 3. directly relates to education of girls, we can argue that all the other goal can be achieved, or better achieved through investment in education. It was very interesting to see the exact statistical data showing how the improvement of gorls'education improved economical and social factors. these alone should be enough to argue while these traditions and social norms (keeping girls from school) are contraproductive and useless for the whole society. These figures are the best arguments, I would say. i would love to see programs targeting the erradication of poverty through girls education even in developed countries where for example the Roma minority lives under horrible circumstances, in deep poverty, facing social exclusion and discrimination. these roma women experience a double burden, being women and Roma at the same time."
"WHO current data indicates; over 140 Millions girls and women are affected by FGM, 100 Million of this being in Africa...its so real !!!"

"I am a Canadian working in India and here too I see the Prussian model in the school systems.  Access to education is improving and in fact, fairly good here, but it is so much based on rote memorization.  I am working in the health field, but experienced this rote learning when I was teaching nursing students.  For example, the students had memorized things to write on a patient's chart without really understanding what it meant, in terms of treatment of care.  In the nursing school, the focus of the curriculum, the tutors, and all the classes was on ensuring that the students passed the board exams each year.  Unfortunately, this resulted in nurses who were good at remembering things, but not as good at applying it, and not good at all at thinking on their own about it.  Fortunately, the Board itself recognized the problem and changed the curriculum to introduce more analytical work and exams that did not rely totally on memorization, but on looking at a situation and developing an approach to deal with it.  Encouraging, but still a long way to go -- especially since they have to get over the culture that says that women should not question (especially men or even women of higher status)."
I inherited a very old-school base layer undershirt from my mother that consisted of basically a medium sized cotton mesh in the form of a shirt. It looks much like mesh tights but with a wider mesh and is to be worn under a slightly tight medium layer to retain heat as well as allow sweat to evaporate efficiently. I think it is a brilliant piece of clothing but have never come across anything like it being sold in stores. I still wear it skiing and am convinced of its merits but perhaps it is somewhat psychological...
Hi Corey! I just wanted to say you're doing an awesome job with the lectures :-)
I found the report and the infographic very interesting and I'd like to comment on some ideas they exposed.
From my experience (as a former alpinist) exercising in the cold helped with adaptation to lower temperatures (enduring them!) but did not provide any metabolic/physiologic endurance benefits.
You can also open the data set up in R and fit the data to determine the coefficients
"Sorry to go off topic but I found the interview with Lynn Murphy to be very engrossing and there was no discussion forum about it, so thought I'd talk about it here. I thought it was interesting to know that girls who surpass that first hurdle of being able to go to school still face problems while they are at school, or making their way to school, as talked about in chapter 3. I guess I'm not overly surprised that girls are being discriminated against by teachers who don't feel they should be there, or seeing textbooks that are implicitly, or perhaps even explicitly, showing gender stereotypes. Could this be the reason, or at least part of the reason, that girls are not going on to secondary schooling? I understand that much of the problem is financial and they cannot afford to go on, but the fact that they are perhaps under-performing at primary schooling could be because of their social setting within the school and feeling like they should not be there. I do think more should be done about the schooling system in order for there to be more female teachers who can go on to be 'role models' for the girls, or maybe ensuring the safety of girls within the school environment so that it does not effect their learning."
"Miriam, "
Oh I love this topic!   I want to hear all about what others are planning.   I need some new ideas!
Goals that relate directly to girls education: Goal 2 and Goal 3. But I think Goal 2 and Goal 3 are interdependent. You need to eliminate Gender disparity to reduce the cultural and social hurdles that will allow all families to send their girls to school for primary education AND you need to increase the number of girls in school to eliminate gender disparity.

"Oxytocin represent the hormone that promote human touch , sometimes when we stress out if we get some one we trust we get some sort of comfort relief some we say in a way we get it off our chest i feels good i let it out and get advise."
"I thought Professor Stacy's personal anecdotes relating to positive rights were the most memorable. The U.S./Australia tuition pricing and debt anecdote...and even the simple braces anecdote resonates well. The idea of positive rights being given for the betterment of a community (like having an educated voting population) makes so much sense, but this stance is often opposed. I think she makes a reasoned argument when she basically says...what is good for the individual will be good for the community."
I can think of only Pros....

"Hello Carolyn,  Thanks for writing. Actually, in this course we do not take up the question of organized religion and its tremendous influence on the lives of women.  It comes up here and there throughout the course.  I hope that you will begin a thread by posting your thoughts on the issue in the discussion forums (rather than as a comment to me).  That way, there can be interaction among the many people who are signed up for this course.  This is a tremendously important issue, but it is one that at the time I was organizing my class at Stanford (more than ten years ago) was not on our radar as much as it is now.  Thanks for raising it.  I hope you'll initiate a discussion thread about it.   <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
"Ohh, that's what you meant when you wrote above that you don't know the equation. I thought you were referring to the regression equation :p"
I like your research very much.
"I appreciated the author's emphasis on the importance of examining women's issues  through the lens of a human rights framework. To adequately examine women's issues through the lens of human rights, one must also understand the other competing arguments (like women as a driving force in development, economic security, etc.) and realize why a human rights lens is unique and urgently necessary. The following point summed up this chapter succinctly: \We focus on women because understanding their unique challenges is a prerequisite to justice.\"" I feel justice is a the heart of what we are all longing for - a world of equality for all women will organically create economic prosperity and stability, healthy citizens, a more peaceful society and less war."""

"Kind of along the same lines, I'm having a real learning curve on using the discussion forums.  With this many people involved in a class, I assume there is a lot of discussion going on.  But I think it would be helpful if when we signed on to our individual accounts, there would be a link shown to view new comments entered. In the mean time, I am very much enjoying the coursework, and just review the discussion as I can.  (Also, had a hard drive fail, and taking a while to get everything back up to speed!)"
"That is a good point.  Actually the D1 teams (the ones in teams$team) are exactly the same ones that have played more than 5 games, so you should automatically only be ranking D1 teams."
"Recently I listened to a speaker regarding physical activity and obesity. Some interesting tidbits she threw out that couldn't be ignored. Before TV, Radio, Garage Door REMOTES, we got up to change the channel, and very likely twice a day opened/closed a garage door. This may not seem like a lot of activity, but it is more representative of our sedimentary lifestyles today.  During my youth, kids rode bikes, played outside, etc.  Today what do our youth do?  They have some really good finger dexterity from electronic toys and smart phones! It will be interesting to see how our youth today age tomorrow."
It's bad. The second mention must have just been a slip on his part.

"IEPSCF and Vitor. Really good and interesting question. This video can also be found in our resources section. I am a fan of Kelly McGonigal- she is a product of Stanford and does a lot of great work translating science into material people can use and understand. With that said, I do disagree with the extremity of the conclusion she draws in this video. Its important to remember that scientists are people, and bring their own biases to every data set (our course in no exception!). Which is why I would encourage you to look at the sources of her talk and draw your own conclusion. In the meantime, I will give you my perspective. "

"Tom2014. PTSD is a really important and difficult topic, of which I am not an expert, so I will only point you to more resources. Exposure therapy has shown some efficacy in scientific papers, but has significant contraindications (or times when its considered best not to use). Even so, there are many who argue that PTSD treatments as they currently stand aren't up to snuff, and we need better interventions. "
"Australia has universal health care called Medicare which means that regardless of how rich or poor you are, everyone has access to health care for free. For example if we have an emergency we go to the ER, they take care of us, if we need to be admitted that is also done, when we are ready to leave they scan our Medicare card, we sign a paper that says the care was for us and off we go. For elective health issues (non-life threatening) such as a knee replacement there are waiting lists which can last from a few months to a couple of years but the surgery would be free. Going to the GP is also subsidised but most people have to pay a gap fee as GPs charge more than the Medicare allocated fee. The gap can be between 10 -50 bucks (sorry for some reason it does not like it if I use the dollar symbol).  If you are on welfare you get a health care card which means that even GP trips are covered although the current government is talking about introducing a minimal 5 dollar fee for welfare recipients as well. On top of this we have PBS which is the Pharmaceutical benefits scheme, so those on welfare or seniors get all their medications subsidised and have to pay only about 5 bucks per medication. Medications are subsidised for most people as well although those not on welfare need to pay more, on average between 30-40 dollars per prescription."
You are both FANTASTIC !!!!
"Hi Anne, my name's <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, not Carolyn, and you're right, words are very important. I did not mean to be harsh.

"It is also worth mentioning that depending on age you can probably regain more of your cardiovascular conditioning then muscle conditioning if you are older.  Muscle power and strength decline with age and if you are over 50 you have the chance to lose the type IIx muscle fibers which once they are deinervated can not be regained.  However, no matter your age with appropriate training you can drastically improve your health and fitness through exercise.  They have done training studies on octogenarians (over 80) and even at that age exercise training can improve muscle function and performance."
"Since 2000, the United Nations¡¯ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have catalysed a global conversation, mobilized resources, and galvanized action to address poverty and promote human development by 2015. However, adolescent girls as a specific population are omitted from the agenda, except in education and the broad goal of gender equality. Less than 2 cents of every development dollar goes to girls, especially those aged 10-14.The MDGs that have made the least progress are the ones related to gender, as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has noted. The MDGs cannot be achieved without a focus on the needs of girls."

"In some cases, depending with the husband and family one is married into, giving birth to girl children only or more girls is good enough reason to be send away or for the husband to marry another wife. The reasoning is that the girl child will get married and take on the husband`s name and thus does not lead to the protection and continuancy of the father`s family and family name. That is possible with the boys because they do not change their names when they get married. That being the case, I am impressed that women`s health is being looked at from a human rights` point of view which allows for women`s issues to be addressed holistically."

"I agree that using a human rights lens to fight for women`s rights is important as such issues will be taken seriously. I remember working for a woman`s organization, sometimes if people, especially men would know that you are working for women`s rights, they would quickly just dismiss you and say...\Oh...its about women\"". Its like everything about women was downplayed and not taken seriously. However, the moment you just said its about human rights, then even the men would be interested and attentive. And so, yes, the human rights lens is critical and so is the language aspect. It is really a lot of work but if we continue with taking action we will surely get the desired results in due course."""
"I concur.  Excellent job Corey.  Initially, I was sad to see Anne was absent, but I thoroughly enjoy your teaching style as well.  Rock on."
I had no idea that half the world population was under 25 years of age with these percentages increasing.  They are a very vulnerable group as 85% of world youth live in poor countries and the flow on effects of this is huge.  It is also an indication of where we age going as a global point of view.  With only 17% using contraception the increase in population and STIs are significant including HIV and AIDS.  Women are an at risk group within an at risk group.  We need to promote education and training to improve opportunity this needs to be supported by government policy.  Children that do not get this educational opportunity and work when they are very young and remain uneducated are more likely to remain poor and have the additional social and health related illnesses.  These are all complex issues that countries need to look at acknowledge and address.

My greatest fear as a \bit culturally slanted male\"" is giving too much power for a person to randomly decide on the termination of pregnancy. But a question that constantly came up was this one of determining when it is ok to abort and by whose principal does it become ok since conditions and contexts differ for the affected women. It all comes down as well to educational levels i suppose, its simpler for an educated individual to be trusted with such a decision wholly than it is for a barely literate being.

"Hi,"
"I found the inclusion of the non-formal education system as one of the most persuasive aspects of Lloyd's research paper. This was a concept that I had previously never heard of and my initial reading made me think that this concept was similar to the informal labour markets - in that it was an alternative service that was completly outside of the existing government and private run service. However, the realisation that this term was used as an umbrella term for alternative and complementary services made me realise the innovation that has gone into providing education in countries with historically low rates of literacy and standards of living. I agree with Lloyd that is particularly important to find out whether such organisation are effective in providing classes for those who have previously fallen outside of the formal education system. One aspect I thought was particularly persuasive was the attempt to bring vocational skills into these non-formal organisations - as it shows that education acts as a conversion factor within the greater narrative of ones life."

"All of the Millennium Goals are related to the education of girls. 2, 3 and 4.  Directly the Second Objective clearly indicates to achieve universal primary education to all the boys and girls.  The Third Objective is also directly related to the education of girls, referred to the empowerment of women and their equality in secondary education and in all levels of education before next year. And I think that the Fourth Objective is also directly related to. Reduce the infant mortality, since it is required that the girls are alive at the required age to begin school. Usually after the age of 5."

"I believe that each goal relates to the education of girls. I also believe that fulfilling all of these goals is greatly dependent on the education of girls. Considering the statistics we have been given through our readings this week, the majority of the people affected by poverty, lack of education, gender discrimination, child mortality, maternal health, lack of environmental sustainability, and lack of development are women. "

"I really enjoyed this week because I live in Oman and exercise 5 days a week outdoors. Now the temperature is cool, but in spring and summer it feels like a sauna outside! We still exercise for around 2 hours every day, but I always wanted to understand what happens to our bodies under temperatures of 45 degrees celsius when we exercise. Now I know how to make the most of exercise and I can advice fellow people who feel tired and overheated during the activities. Thank you!"
I completly agree... its so frustrating to see so negative reports/ numbers/ data around women and what makes me more angry are those Jokes that are built around women or empowered women rather in the name of Humour.

"Serbia ratified CEDAW Convention in 2001 with now reservations whatsoever. As a participant in an NGO group that defended the part of the Shadow Report of NGOs from Serbia at the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 55th session (8 - 26 July 2013 in Geneva) I can say that putting reservations or not does not change the fact that states do not abide international documents and that CEDAW Convention is a \soft\"" law that does not contain any sanctions if its points are being violated or the states just ignore them. I do not say that we do not need CEDAW, I just say that we should give CEDAW some tool to punish states from wrongdoing."""
"hello! I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Oxford (not very exotic!). I'm very excited about this course, I'm joining a wee bit late, but aiming to catch-up :-)"
"I am French but live in the UK so decided to check France. France made a couple of reservations but I think all of them are fair enough, mostly just confirming legal parameters (change of name, payments for provisions of housing, social security etc) but one that caught my eye was \The Government of the French Republic declares that no provision of the Convention must be interpreted as prevailing over provisions of French legislation which are more favourable to women than to men.\"" Well, interesting! I will research whether France actually does have better conventions for women than the CEDAW!"

"Hey! I also found the whole discussion on non-formal education really interesting, though it seems to me super challenging. As Lloyd and the other authors highlight (in Chapter 2 I think) quality is not really measured and in this case I wonder how well non-formal education programs can be evaluated. I mean, I can imagine that exclusive religious education (whatever the religion is) is probably not the best way to enhance skills in critical thinking or gender social norms (which are both shown as being really important in Chapter 3). But indeed, I find enhancing some of the positive aspects of non-formal education can be very helpful in designing projects targeting girls for after-school  or other \extra-scholar\"" activities!"""
"I was shocked to see that Anne will not be our tutor for this unit! i mean Corey is doing a good job but his voice is low and a bit monotonous which needs a little boost and a sprinkle of sense of humor and he'll be great. and Anne, love the skydiving hair!please come back next week, we really miss you!"
I recently moved to the Bay Area. Thanks for sharing this terrific fact. It is really amazing to be in a place that is taking these kinds of initiatives. I am going to do some research to see if any other cities ratified CEDAW on a local level.
"I really appreciate your sharing your story as a teacher in Lesotho. The entire time I was reading these articles and looking at the infographic etc...I couldn't help but think how all of these resources are poured into writing these reports and really broad generalizations on what to do and what is happening are the results. But each country, community, village, etc..is different one from the other. This is not to say that the work being done by organizations like Pop Council aren't extremely useful but sometimes I feel like the audience that reads isn't appropriate. "
"The next time Stanford talks to the people at OpenEdX, I suggest asking that they design the ability to sort threads by those which have unread posts.  I, for one, \follow\"" a very large number and have to keep \""viewing more threads\"" to make sure there aren't some with posts from latecomers.  Thanks!"""
"The Dive effect appears to be controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (Fight or Flight) so the peripheral vasoconstriction and increased heart rate should be a similar coping mechanism to whole body cold water immersion as we saw in the video.

"Acturally this is not a difficult problem. I found it tricky when I first saw it and did not think about it carefully. Just follow Arbiturka and other people's suggestion, you will solve it."
"I will just give you an example, in Serbia LGBT population wants to exercise one of the ISECR freedom of assembly - and hold a Parade where they will communicate that being LGBT is their human right! Well, banns their Parade every year. So, they are the only group of people in Serbia that cannot have this rights. International community did nothing, nobody punished Serbia, EU said:\Ok. That is not nice but still you can join EU.\"" So I am a little bit skeptic when it comes to feasibility for an individual (or group) to approach the international law and justice system. Nothing happens. LGBT people can start a lawsuit in front of the Court for human rights in Strasbourg against the state, but the peak is that the court will maybe fine Serbia to pay reimbursement to LGBT organizations - BUT from the joint budget - the budget of the people that believe that they should have all their human rights - as I am. People that prohibit practice of human rights should be fined, not all."""
"Using data from the World Bank and the UN, the Guardian created an interactive map that offers a snapshot of how women's rights are legislated around the world - very interesting tool!"
"Great to hear a first-hand perspective. I am skeptical of Lloyd's conclusion that young women don't drop out as a result of pregnancy and marriage, but that those things follow the decision to drop out."
I just finished the module on aging and finally noticed what is changing and yet staying the same: the picture of Da Vinci's vitruvian man!  I'm so slow to notice this!  It must be that I was so focused on the scintillating discussion that I didn't notice the background picture.  Or realizing that as I'm aging I must be getting less observant ...  I'd better amp up my daily exercise to combat this obvious decline in my cognitive abilities!  :)

Hello from the US (California) - Thank you for posting this Community Agreement. I am excited about this course and enjoying the tea times!
Also probably because she is physically fit.
"I found the readings to be very interesting- boys vs. girls, FGM, fair access.....  The various things that girls and woman go through to exist in some part of the world is troubling; let alone to challenges of accessing basic education. It further reiterates the  needs for us play our part in the development of our girls and young women.  "
This was a fascinating module.
"I just watched this documentary on Netflix called \It's A Girl\"" and it reinforced and further discussed the topic of son preference that I have learned about in this course. They interviewed women in China and India about feticide, infantcide, sex determination, etc. Everyone in this course should check it out!"""
Kevin -- many thanks for all the work.
I am so glad that I found this class. Reading the chapters and people's responses have really helped me understand that while it seems that we've come a long way to help our sisters there is still so much to do. I am glad I am getting the added knowledge. Thank you.
Please let us know by using this thread. We appreciate your patience and will aim to fix any issues as soon as we can!
"I'm from Estonia (Northern Europe), and we traditionally have dry saunas, where we have stones on the sauna stove and we throw water on it, which makes it more wet. The steam saunas around here are not as hot in temperature, as the traditional (dry) saunas are. To the dry sauna we may go when there is around 100 degrees C in the sauna, whereas in the steam sauna there might be around 50-70 degrees, easily. When one throws water on the stones in the dry sauna, even though the water cools the sauna and thus brings the temperature down (if you keep throwing the water over and over the stove becomes cooler, unless you keep heating it) - the hot steam that feels as if way hotter to the skin than the dry air. I also sometimes cover my face when the water is thrown."
breathing in and out helps the body to relax the  parasympathetic nervous system is the friendly system that helps us to go within our self and find solution that can be inspiring and progressing that helps us to let go of harmful stress.
"I totally agree. Also, this this information is extremely helpful for persons of any age. While I am familiar with the stress response, I never put it in the context of human relationships. Nor did I fully understand how greatly it affects our behavior with those we love the most. To Anne and Corey: THANK YOU for giving us some real-life perspective on this everyday, physiological response, and some ideas on how to deal with it. I know I will remember your words when I need to in the future."
"Hi Btvdan, lower O2 and nerves make for a physiologically stressful situation. It would have been more informative had the team also tracked other measures of stress, though."
"Marilyn, Thank you for the suggestion.  Corey and I agree and we have been talking with the folks at OpenEdx about it.  They are working hard to making it better for next time. We apologize for the inconvenience of the current version. "
Professor in the making!
"Education is very powerful. I was not surprised by the fact that less women actually enter the workforce even after having schooling -- this is, I'm sure, because of marriage and childrearing. This is sad, because humanity places so much on marriage and having children that a lot of women do not pursue education further or even a lasting career."
"It is sad that so many girls drop out of school, and I am also skeptical of their reasons not solely being pregnancy or marriage. I wonder what the curriculum has for these students that isn't gender stereotypical. I wonder what books they read and what values they are taught. If there were more lessons that truly empowered women and didn't play into gender roles, then maybe less girls would drop out."
"Keli2012, "
"I think all of them are related! They all coincide in some way...maternal education will lead to less poverty, hunger, and mortality of children, which then leads to more children in school. If more children are in school, then goals 2 and 3, which are geared towards girls' education, can at least try to be accomplished. "
I think that the criteria for selecting between models is how the model performs on out of sample data. The insignificant terms are likely to overfit the training data. So that will render the model less valuable against the out of sample.
"I would also like to see the data available on the site - manipulating it ourselves in Excel, etc could definitely have proven useful."

"I am no expert for sure. Certainly, any modifications to attitudes probably will be slow and generational. Obviously education and exposure to outside cultures will help, but actually entering the household (as in the case of the Indian survey practice) seems like a way the governments/municipalities (who wish to make changes) can actually at least reach all the girls.  Like most women's movements, eventually it will be the women themselves who need to be the voice and force for change."
"In the videos, it is stated that the likelihood function can be expressed as follows:"
Hi JeanSnh
"I think so, I also think that mothers who are well educated are less likely to place their children in these situations"
"I don't think education hinders the ability of women to care for families. I think it makes them more able to do so.  There is less child mortality, along with better outcomes.  The issues of education is often tangled up in discussion on the cash economy.  But i do not think it is an either or, but rather both/and.  I think that the issues is that caring does not carry the same weight of financial security but education in my opinion and in every study I have ever seen does support that the more education women have the better they are able to care for their families health and wellbeing."
"The video and readings both emphasized the importance of looking at underrepresented populations within the general population when considering the condition of human rights throughout the world. After traveling and working in various locations around the globe, it does not come as a great surprise that women, children, indigenous groups, and people with disabilities are those that are at the greatest disadvantage. "
"That's a really good point, IschraCS!"
"I found the US's refusal to sign the CEDAW an embarrassment. However, I am impressed by the grass-roots women's organizations highlighted at the end of chapter 1. Women cannot wait for someone else to make the changes for them. That being said, it is the responsibility of EVERY individual--male or female--to see that human rights are not violated."
"As a part time working mother of two kids aged 3 and 5 I truly think the answer to combining education/work and family for women is part time/shared jobs which wouldn't be considered lower quality performance per se AND appropriate spouse participation in family/household running AND affordable/quality day care and after school care. Anyway, it's very demanding for all participants on many levels."
"I too found that section as crucial. The chapter distinguished between assigning categories as okay, but making destructive value judgments based on those as the problem, stating that this leads to seeing people as the ¡°other¡± (11). Differences can and should be celebrated, but should not be misused to justify abuses and--as you mentioned--us versus them mentality."
"I love the concept as stress being a tool to overcome certain circumstances and a form of motivation.  That's a brilliant way of thinking, I am going to approach new stressful experiences with this mentality!"
"While goals 2 and 3 specifically reference women and education, like many of the other posters here I would argue that all the goals depend on women and their education. "
Thank you
"ok, thank you."
Thank you for your suggestion! :)
"Some people get a danger signal from immersing their face in water. I don't know the psychological or physiological explanation. A technique which helps some people with this problem is to encourage them to immerse the face in water at times when they are in their normal environment, rather than the scary pool. It's desensitisation to the source of fear, in an environment where they have control."

Bill Nye debated Ken Ham recently http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/<phoneRedac>/watch-this-bill-nye-debates-evolution-with-the-founder-of-the-creation-museum and one of his highlighted supports for why we need more scientifically literate students in the world reminded me of the fact that United States has not ratified CEDAW. The statement Mr. Nye made is that there are NO (NOT ONE) college in the state of Kentucky where you can get a degree in Nuclear Science because the people of Kentucky have a fear of that kind of Science and also possibly an inherent love of ignorance. Close to the same reasons Helen Stacy mentioned our government won't ratify CEDAW because of the possible interpretation.

Hi
Very inspiring to read information on the direct link between education for girls and earning power.  Also critical thinking and problem solving focus is very important for overall function after completion of basic education.
"I've done more than 70 marathons and ultramarathons, I've yet to hit the dreaded wall.  When I start to feel lack of energy or a mental low coming on, I can usually fix it with food.  Coke, Mt. Dew, and ramen noodles have saved many a-races!"
"Congratulations on getting such beautiful curves of the heart rate during the stresses of sky diving and public speaking! They show convincingly the major role of they sympathetic system when we are subjected to stresses involving \negative\"" emotions like fear, anxiety, uncertainty and anger."
I guess we are machines designed to react to a given stimulus(input)and we all are not the same machine.We have changes during our birth and changes that accumulate during our lifetime because of our different experiences.Such as if a child who never knew what a snake is will not react to the snake even if it bites him but an experienced and known person would react to that.I think it should give your answer...
"That is a tricky issue but, some countries do better than others. I strongly encourage you all to take a look at Sweden and Denmark as marvelous examples were most women work full time AND families are valued and children are taken care of!"
To add: R by itself is a correlation(How good it fits the points/data) and R squared is how well it explains it

As I said, I'm amazed by this fascinating technique."

"This chapter gives us a very broad based knowledge of how women are discriminated in the underdeveloped countries, not only by gender bias but by overall neglect which follows like physical, mental and socio-economic aspects as well. "
"Hi all,"
"Interesting site, thanks for sharing - although I though I don't hold out much hope even as I read it. Sadly as I look at a country I once lived in - none of those rights are upheld. It is the same as with the UN  Declaration of Human Rights. The speaker said last week that although a country has signed it, it really doesn't hold water unless there are specific laws within each country and money/power to back them up. :/"
"This is so true! I have heard that children in India are not given food so they eventually agree to beg on the streets. They are even harmed or incapacitated physically so they can bring in more money when they beg. The movie \Slum dog Millionaire\"" was an example of poverty in the slums of Mumbai, India. Worth watching this movie if you get a chance."""

"It's interesting to note that CEDAW does not even mention abortion, but does state that women have the right to have access to health care."
Thanks :)
"I was so happy to see that Dr. Murray dedicated such attention to mental health in her prologue. I understand well that there has been such a near-total lack of attention by researchers and cross-sector lack of interest in most countries as to make any comprehensive overview of women's MH difficult. I challenge all of us to take note and make sure that global MH is recognized as a priority for research and intervention, as an issue that intersects with all areas of health, rights, and well-being."
I think Helen Stacy answered that in her interview when speaking about the conservative /Republican need to cater to the anti-abortion movement which sees CEDAW as promoting (or at least allowing for) abortion.
"As many people have pointed out, my country (the United States) is a signatory of CEDAW but has not ratified it. "
"I found the second article very interesting. My thoughts are actually that it is very interesting that women all over the world have many things in common and how especially the worry over a loved one (men, husbands, sons) is theme that comes through all over the world.

"Yes Aleksandra! I agree. And by the way it is the exact same situation in Albania (I'm American but I was a Peace Corps volunteer there in 2008-2009 and went back again to spend last summer researching deinstitutionalization and community mental health/social services). Women in this region of the world too often risk their lives suffering under violence in their home because they fear even more what will happen to them if they speak out or leave the situation (abandonment, shunned in local society, even killed)."

"It is renowned that all in all the highest levels of illiteracy concentrate in rural areas, where to all the problems mentioned such as son preference of demeaning attitude towards girls, there are material limitations given by the fact that schools are not around! Long distances further discourage regular attendance especially for girls, as they are both more exposed to the risk of harassment and because it is felt that instead of taking a long time every day to go to school and back, they can stay at home and make \better\"" use of their day! "
"There is an interesting article in The Guardian relating to adolescent sexuality, and how the young women themselves need to take a leadership role in this endeavor to protect them.    Link:     http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jul/04/adolescent-girls-sexual-health-research"
"Thanks for this interview.  It is particularly interesting.  I never understood before that human rights were only ideas and political ideals.  I used to think of them as something we were all born with. Also the explanations of the US's refusal to sign the treaties, are an eye opener.  In the case of it's refusal to ratify CEDAW, I have to say that the ancient patriarchal norms which stubbornly cling to modern day life are a lot more powerful than I gave them credit for.  Can't understand why this is so.  Look how many changes the US and the world have been through since 1776.  Hope to hear more from Professor Stacey during this course."
"\Many issues of women¡¯s health have long been invisible, and considered too 'private' to discuss. Here we try, as Gandhi counsels, to 'make injustice visible.'\"" This quote from the Prologue is meaningful to me as I feel a huge part of the problem is that there is so much going on that we don't know about. More people need to be aware of the injustices in order for the women's voices to be heard."""
"It's interesting to see that Rwanda now has 60% of women in Congress. It was very recent that they went through the Civil War where the women had no say. I just met someone that was in the military stationed in Rwanda through the UN in 94 and 95 and was telling me how difficult it was for women during that time, especially with the amount of rapes that occurred. It's great to see that countries like Burma, Iraq, Sudan  can turn their history around in terms of human rights just as Rwanda has been doing."
"This question almost got me too. Page one in our textbook says, "

"Yes, there will likely be many predictors with large p-values. These"
"Ravil, I think you are right and the Prof. made a slight error.  In the portion of the video you mentioned, he said it right the first time when talking about the TSS, identifying the \true\"" values (maybe \""measured\"" would have been better, who knows if they are correct?) and their mean, but then he points to the same area of the screen and appears to talk about the error of the predicted values.  I never even noticed that the first time through -- you have a keen eye.  Aren't videos great:  maybe we will learn to forgive, but we will never be able to forget..."""
"I found both articles very interesting to read. The more and more we go in to the course, more and more it becomes interesting and eye opening."
"I agree, I too feel that mental health awareness is essential in sustaining and maintaining a healthy life. It came as no surprise to me that women are overlooked as well in this category of global health issues. I hope that the world can come together and combat this issue, great post!"
"All of the goals listed have a strong connection to girls education and are dependent on the education of girls but goal 2 and 3 state girls' education specifically. Let's look at a goal that I consider \dependent on\"" versus \""related directly\"". Goal 4 which is to reduce childhood mortality, this goal is dependent on girls' education because it can get closer to being met by educating girls. We learned this from previous readings such as the infographic which reads: A child who's mother can read is 50% more likely to live past age 5. Goal 6, to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS. This goal is dependent on girls' education because it can be tackled from education on safer sex practices and according to article \""New Lessons\"" educating girls can delay when girls begin to have sexual intercourse. Another reading predicts that educated girls are more likely to enter into stable marriages therefore reducing her exposure to HIV/AIDS from the partner that she is practicing monogamy with. "
"Yes, Madagascar has signed (17 July 1980) and ratified (17 March 1989) CEDAW, but hasn't placed any reservation or objections against it. The reason for this is that Women's rights are not really a priority for successive governments, and its implementation is still weak. Thankfully, numerous NGOs and international organizations such as UNDP work on the field, because otherwise, Malagasy women would be totally left neglected!"

One of our former prime ministers spoke about freedom, not in terms of being free from government interference, but freedom as being free from worry - the worry of what would happen to me and my family if I lost my job, or if I got sick, about my children's future in general, about my parents when they get old, worry about if I have to chose family or career (i.e. paid maternity and paternity leave and access to affordable preschool etc). This kind of freedom made possible because of the services provided to you by your government. I think that this was of course not seen to be in opposition to the civil and political rights, but that both could exist at the same time and enhance each other. However, I agree with <redacted> <redacted> regarding the down side to this system, a a downside that only brings shame and violence onto ourselves in Europe."
"What an interesting question! Seems pretty reasonable, and I've heard people claim this is true. But I don't know, so I started on a little exploration. "
"This report is well-written and provides us with lots of useful information. However, I would like to add another point to the agenda mentioned at the end of the document. "
Ah yes geelokings. You most certainly have caught me. I've had my heart flutter over many a girl in my day. Last time was in undergrad- where I met my girlfriend- a student in one of Anne's undergraduate classes! : )

"Thank you for this online course, available around the world, for everybody! It's not only educational but also essential that these topics and issues are discussed worldwide. So we can open eyes, minds and hearts to take action and give worldwide support. Personally, I work as a holistic therapist with the focus on women. To support them, step into their power, educate myself and them about the possibilities, alternatives and power we have within us. This course only makes my heart desire stronger; see our own beauty, value and power as a women in this world."
"I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, currently a midwifery student in Germany. I completed both my B.A. and M.A. in the humanities but have had an increasing interest in feminism, women's rights, and women's health. I'm excited to learn from this course what I can do as an educator and future midwife to empower the girls and women I work with. I also look forward to learning about some of the cultures and laws that have affected immigrants I will be working with here in Germany."
"The goals 'Achieve universal primary education', 'Promote gender equality and empower women' and in a way, 'Develop a global partnership for development' are ones which I perceive to relate to girls' education. The first two are obvious, but the reason I picked Goal #8, about global partnership for development, is because it details the following: \In co operation with developing countries, develop and implement strategies for decent and productive work for you.' The reason I see this as being pertinent is because most work needs at least some basic training, and the higher education a person has, the better job they are qualified for, therefore the more they will be paid etc. It's an upward ladder which has significant and far reaching benefits and effects, such as changing the perspectives of the individual, for any children she might have, and even contribute to the economic status of her country. One less person who is uneducated and unemployed.  "
Two MDGs directly refer to girls' education: MDG 3 and MDG2.
I just missed mentioning the simple way of dealing with stress. Why people doen't avoid stress. A man who suffers from chronic stress should be asked why he does things that make he nervous. Maybe fighting with chronic stress is worthless and needs simply to change your job or change the sport you are doing or isolate yourself from people who make you stresful. People should do things that they like to do and that fit to them.
Well done Corey

"This is a good point. In 2012 and 2013 I ran the UTMB and the condidtions couldn't have been more different. In 2012 in the snow and ice it was easier to keep running than to stop as I guess we were generating more heat, but once you stopped at an aid station the only way to warm up (it seemed) was to stick your hands under the heaters. Likewise in 2013 when the weather was great it was uncomfortable running as you felt like you were overheating but when you could stick your head and hands into water buckets it was almost like instant relief. Strangely though I was able to finish in 2012 but not 2013 so perhaps I'm better suited to the cold stuff?"
Hello from England! Really excited to be on this course. After a quick glance at the 2011 data sheet I'm completely shocked to realize how many women believe domestic violence for any reason is appropriate or acceptable. It's clear that there are certain values and ways of thinking that have permeated into society and I'll be very interested to learn more about this in the coming weeks.
"z-statistic measures whether a particular explanatory variable (X1), **given that the other variables (X2,X3,...,Xp) are in the model**, has an effect on the dependent variable. Your example demonstrates that variable selection is difficult."
"While Goal is directly related to girl's education, all MDGs are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment. No girl education means no better society."
"Goals 2 and 3 most definately relate to girls' education, since they directly address issues of schooling, particularly primary education. "
"I concur with the others on this forum that goals 2 + 3 directly relate to girls¡¯ education, yet in way all the other goals are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment."
I normally copy and paste in Word trascripts of videos I liked most. Not that it takes much time but it would help to have this available as part of the course materials.
yes! this will increase sweating and a loss of water weight. This method is used among weight restricted athletes such as boxers as they must meet weight requirements.
This question is indeed a little bit tricky. 
"B lists the right order of decrement, beginning with **weightlifting** which decreases more rapidly, than the others after 45, followed by **running**, which dips about 1.7% per year. **Biking** is said to be more stable, due to the reduction of repetitive loading injuries."
I got by on 300.
"As previously said by other coursemates, for the fulfilment of most or all UN MDG, educating girls is essential. Educating girls will result not only in healthier women and children but also in women with increased capacity to decide on their own future. Education allows for not only basic literacy but it is also an empowering tool as it can promote that girls' capacities are recognised and fostered."
"Here's a trick: Every time you hear the word \stress\"", or see anything about healthy lifestyle or anything else that could make you think about living better, take a few deep breaths. Taking the deep breaths feels so good, you'll want to do it more. After a few months, perhaps you'll remember to do it as soon as the phone rings or the computer misbehaves, or your kid pushes back against bed time, or... It works for me."""
"Hi Colin, I have worked with a few people with similar issues in my coaching business. I'll let someone else work on your social anxiety with you, but you could certainly start getting fit without even getting near other people. You could work with a coach who could give you workouts over email, or if even that is too much visibility, you could start working out with any of the hundreds of videos that are available on-line. Good luck."
"It_s a lesson for the entire world the benefits about to invest in women_s education, because the results are great not only for the own women, are great for their families, overall children, for their countries, for everyone."
"I'm assuming that the \save\"" feature is most useful for situations where a quiz has many questions (or a few very time-consuming questions)."
"The argument that educating girls is about justice and a human right is convincing, but equally powerful is the argument about improvements for individual girls and their community. The stats in the infographic are staggering in their scope. The readings and lectures this week have been eye opening for me and immensely valuable in adding to the understanding I'm gaining about why the human rights angle is so central to the lives of women and girls. "
Yup.
"Totally agree with you, over all because a woman who has the knowledge and power of take her own decisions will take care about her health (in relation to 4,5 and 6 goals), and also will take care about the education of her own children, boys and girls, education."
"As previously stated by fellow classmates, MDGs 2 and 3 are directly related to girls' education. MDG 2 aims to achieve universal primary education by educating all boys and girls through the basic level of education. MDG 3 aims to promote gender equality and empower women by ensuring gender-equal participation in primary and secondary education and later at all levels of education."
"In this case then, no answers should be market as incorrect. In order to have only one correct answer, line 17 should read: **Smarket$train = Year<2005**"
Hello my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> I'm starting a little late I really hope I can catch up. I'm excited to get started.I am 52 years old I recently received my high school diploma I also take care of my grandson. I am doing this for me and for the women in my faith community. Love the topic.
It was uncanny for me how similar the stories are to those you hear in Jamaica. The study and methodology used was exciting for me because it really got to the depth of the matter and we really get inside the lives of these women. 
"I, too, must agree that for the MDGs to be successful, it is necessary to view them all through a gendered perspective. For example, in a previous article we read about how women are the main providers of food for their families. Revenue from popular \cash crops\"" goes to men despite their minimal involvement. New technology is for men's use or of little effective assistance to women. So from the very start (looking at MDG #1), in order to achieve the goal, it would be absolutely critical to speak to women and to work with them to \""eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.\"" "
Touche.
"I think if a woman is educated and finds herself in an abusive relationship, she is much more likely to know what her options are in regards to stopping the abuse, or removing herself from it than her uneducated counterpart. And as jnd9 pointed out a well educated mother is less likely to put her children in such a situation and thus this would help end the cycle of abuse also."
"Poland signed the Convention on 29 May 1980 and ratified it quite soon, on 30 July 1980. Some reservation was made upon the Convention, it was, however, withdrawn by the Government of Poland in October 1997."
"Canada is a signatory of CEDAW, ratified it in late 1981 and it came into effect as of January 1982.  As has been said, Canada filed a declaration on Article 11 (1) (d) regarding equal pay without discrimination on the basis of sex.  It states it is developing legislation on this.  Pay equality is covered under the Canadian Human Rights Act (1977) but this only covers areas of federal jurisdiction. Implementation is primarily carried out at the provincial level where legislation varies."
Sounds like a great idea.  Add me and I'll add you back.  We go from there?
"I have a 3 year old son who is in preschool.  It is really interesting to note how different children play/ act/ socialize. Completely anecdotal, but through my observation of his peers in preschool the past two years, toddler girls in general seem to be a lot more socially in-tune with other children, adults and what's going on in the environment around them. Both Nature/ biology and nurture are a part of the picture, of course. But social conditioning of expected gender norms (nurture) seems to make a bigger difference as children age. If through both biology and culture, females are more social creatures, I can see social acceptance of peers and those they look up to (educators, parents, community leaders, etc), to play a great role in desire for education. "
It's an ambiguous use of the word 'speed' to mean 'the time it takes to react'
"Thank you for another great resources section this week.  I'd like to share this one I find very helpful for beginners.  It's available on iPhone, Android, and, of course, for desktops.  This app makes it easy to lengthen the duration of exhalations, which I now know is great for vagal tone."
"Great question and there's actually a whole body of literature dedicated to this topic. One of the easiest ways is to do what you suggested and remove the entire record. Another option is to use the average value for that field when the field is missing. A more complicated option is to use imputation or a separate predictive model where you estimate the value of the missing field based on other fields. The approach likely depends on the data you have, the available time and the purpose of the project."
An extension of the linear model is a linear model with non-linear and interaction terms.
"One can use measure called the Gini coefficient to compare logistic regression models. Gini is a summary of ROC curve which says how your model separates \good\"" and \""bad\"" cases. Some statisticians use also the K-S statistics (maximal difference between CDF's of \""good\"" and \""bad\"" cases)."

Well thought out responses Corey.
"After listening to the interview with Dr. Benson and looking at the Stress Reflection segment I had many thoughts.  I know what my stressors are and for the most part they will not disappear.  I often remove myself from the offending situation, go for a run, or use a communion with old Mother Nature to calm stress.  I would like to incorporate some meditation into my life but wonder if there is some length of time or certain time of day that has proven most beneficial. I would imagine early morning or late evening hours are most convenient but perhaps it doesn't matter.  Thoughts anyone?"
"I very much appreciate the attention given to statistics and data in Chapter 3 of \From Outrage to Courage\"" (Murray 2013). Murray reminds us that statistics often capture absolute levels of enrollment (Ibid.: 42); however, it is necessary to look at both enrollment and attendance to get the full picture (Ibid.: 43). The heavy reliance on enrollment as an indicator of girls' education is a lazy response to a complex issue."
"I guess we can have men that are part of our circle of influence to start seeing it. Change begins at home!! (borrowing from charity begins at home). I think people living in the developed world, I live in California, don't see a lot of these issues, men or women. It's not that they don't want to or don't care, its not part of their consciousness so the more we all can do to bring it up to people and make them see I think the more awareness it would create."
"I found this document difficult reading, but well worth the effort (so far - I must admit I haven't made it through all 150 pages of it - yet - and am only about 1/2 way through the whole publication)."
"This is not a trivial question at all.  What you're describing is subsampling, and it's very similar to the bootstrap.  The bootstrap is conceptually simpler to implement because a bootstrap sample of size n is roughly as noisy relative to the original sample as the original sample is to the population.  Whereas for subsampling you have to decide on which k to use, then you'll often have to make a correction for the fact that your resamples are of different size than your original sample."
Thank you for sharing!

"Good answer, Chris!"
"I feel that Goal 2 of the United Nations Millenium Goals (\Achieve universal primary education\"") relates directly to girls' education by its very definition. Goal 3 (\""Promote gender equality and empower women\"") also relates directly; however, I feel that the ultimate goal of attaining gender equality is also reliant dependent upon equal quality and opportunity of education for girls."
"Goal 2 Access to universal primary education is the bases for development. The other seven goals are fulfilled if countries attain goal 2. You can not separate them as they are closely linked. A woman who has gone through primary school will be inspired to go to secondary school. Then she is well informed about combating HIV/AIDS, Causes of maternal mortality,  Better employment to earn better living conditions, they will be aware of their rights and they will join global partnership to challenge issues of discrimination and gender violence. This couse is pursued in the fulfilment of the MDGs."
"I appreciated your post.  I have always been appalled by the act of female genital mutilation.  It was not until I read the comparison with circumcision that I finally understood how people can consider this acceptable.  Circumcision is cultural, health related, religious and there is social pressure.  I can see now that the women conducting the FGM ceremonies are following some of the same rationale.  I would be interested in discussing the differences between the two practices."
"I thought this statistic was shocking!  This one stat should be heralded globally.  I would like to see more information on how this stat was arrived.  However, after the reading we have already done, I would surmise that the more educated a women is, the less likely she is going to have an abortion, more likely to have a clean and healthy birth, less likely to neglect her child once he/she is born, less likely to allow herself to be abused while pregnant or allow the child to be abused, and will likely have more financial ability to support her family.  I am sure I am missing other reasons for this statistic, but I found it to be startling.  "

Add me all:
"There are several factors at play, but here are a couple to think about:"
I prefer jogging in the morning due to the cooler temperature as well as better endurance.
"I am also curious about the body's response to exercise as a stressor. I would assume that physical training is very similar, in terms of physiological effect, to what we saw with Dr. Friedlander's skydiving experiment. I would expect high intensity training or long endurance training to activate the sympathetic nervous system. Think of how an athlete may not notice a twisted ankle until after the end of a race. This is part of the \fight or flight\"" response as I understand it."
"Neither Macedonia or the US has signed CEDAW. Helen made it very clear why the US hasn't signed CEDAW, but it will be interesting to understand why Macedonia hasn't."

Very good suggestion thank you!
"So excited to be taking this course!! Im excited to learn more about the various aspects of women issues including maternal and child health, but its true that women's health encompasses a vast majority of other areas.looking forward to learning and growing from this course as well as the community formed around this course. I too was shocked from the percentage of women from the data sheet that agreed that domestic violence from their husbands was okay! wow! such a mentality must be broken, women must learn their rights worldwide!"
"I totally agree, Thank you Corey."
"Thanks for the praise!  I¡¯m glad you could appreciate these thoughts.  It sounded like we may have been going through the same process of breaking away from all of the statistical reasons to do right by the women and realizing that doing right is reason enough.  The ironic part is that we can only imagine the effects of valuing justice over development; I believe striving for true equality without any other expectations would produce astounding results.  As we talk about subordination of women, we should certainly acknowledge that when women are given their rights in effort to further other goals then they being used are tools and as long as that mindset exists there will never be true equality.  No one will deny that individual females are better off for being used to achieve development goals but women need not be the stepping stones.    "
I was horrified to read Anne's chapter about FGM...I've already heard about this before but had no occasion to run through details like this...People who perform FGM deserve death penalty in my sense because they're just ruining these girls and women's life. This is disgusting! 
"I was raised one of two daughters. It would never have occurred to me that my parents could have wanted a boy. We two girls were both very valued. I had two daughters myself, which was exactly what I wanted.  The United States has many things to fix to become equal for both genders, but gratefully, I don't think this \preference for sons\"" is one of them."""
I quite agree. Thank you for your thoughts!
"Very interesting interview with Lynn Murphy on learning and schooling. The discussion on the importance of looking beyond access to school / enrolment rates in looking at the contents, the quality, and the relevance of the learning as well as the future careers. A step further than just looking at numbers, which I find very logically but which asks another approach. A discussion which is relevant for most development issues, gender, economic development, health, ...., very often the quality and the contents are not accounted for as long as numbers are reached.  I am happy to learn that cross cultural initiatives exist all over the world to look at the _ what are we learning, and is it relevant, what does it bring us in daily life _. Really going back to the grass roots level and asking ourselves, does it make sense what we are doing."

Agreed! The statistics and reverberating impacts presented in these readings are stunning. I believe most people do not fully understand the depth of importance of educating girls - especially in developing countries. I sure didn't. There is still so much work to be done - yet we've already accomplished so much! This is not an easy feat and I am truly inspired by women that have dedicated their lives to rights and equal opportunity for women!
 Hi - I am looking for a group too. <emailRedac> 
"Hi Bev,"
I think you are on the right track. You do not need to know any R programming to get this answer. You just need to know what the given coefficients mean and how they relate the regression formula.
"I don't think so, Trlake. Whereas male circumcision has been proven to reduce some health risks in populations with scarce access to water and hygiene, female mutilations do not. Whereas male circumcision only acts on skin (and I have seen it performed in Africa, in a village CLINIC so in a bad enough situation, but not so bad, it's not painless and it's quite bloody, as far as it regards me it's already appalling), female mutilation is deprivation of a part of the body and bodily function. Whereas male circumcision is just ritual, female mutilation has the actual function to improve male pleasure while depriving the woman of it, or best, leaving her with pain. It has all to do with male (and social but in a male controlled society) control over woman, and nothing more. Something is left also in the West. At delivery, today, most women in the so called \first world\"" countries, will get a cut on their genitals at childbirth, usually only in the first (it marks a passage, doesn't it), in the distorted idea that this will avoid her tearing (or rather will avoid her tissues to stretch properly and leave her unharmed) and then it was in use to give her a good and tight \""marital stitch\"" so that she could be as tight as new... this has all to do with male control and male pleasure, and not with medical necessity."""
"Yes, but in the study presented women were not financially depndent on the husbands and still the husband holds power."
"What was really interesting to me in the article about Ghana is the relationship between the family economy - financially providing for the family and the power in the family. In Ghana women even if finacially providing for the family did not hold the power. This is fascinating as in the West financial resources are often mentioned as a key reason for keeping the power by men, as the men provide for the family with the money (as the unpaid work isnt valued), this is what legitimises their decision power (the women who is not working and with no money has difficulties in living a husband which makes her more vulnerable). In Ghana the power of men is more embeded in the culture, with little economical context. The men has power and little responsibilities."
"Any model which is linear in the fitting parameters is a linear model, thus also stuff like"
"I found the second week's readings very interesting and relevant, especially since I only completed them yesterday, which was also the International Day to End FGM. The statistics remain very alarming and one would think that with the work done by women's groups and international organisations like UNICEF and the UNFPA,things would be different. "
"Goals 2 and 3 seem to be most directly related to girls' education. Goal 2 \Achieving Universal Primary Education\"" is an all-inclusive goal working towards all boys and girls completing primary schooling. Though it doesn't state anything specific about girls' education, implicit in Goal 3's \""Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women\"" execution and success would be equal participation of women and girls in society at all levels."
"I use my wife's ipad to look at the discussion board. The left panel \Show All Discussions\"" gets really annoying when I scroll through the topics."""
"The concept of negative vs. positive rights was one that I had never heard of before. When Helen Stacy first mentioned negative rights, I thought it was going to be something, well, negative. Instead it turned out to be essentially rights where governments need to take a step back and not interfere in our lives, so that these rights are not infringed upon (i.e. housing militia, taxation, [freedom of] religion, etc.) On the contrary, positive rights are rights in which governments must take action in order to ensure these rights are delivered to its citizens."

I also liked the information dispelling the common myths about influencing factors to education during the adolescent time period.  I don't feel like there is enough focus on outside factors that create barriers or sabotage girls continuing their education. Those factors might include family dynamics or societal trends. There needs to be more information about the bridges between education and the private/public sectors that can help work through the obstacles that impede girls from continuing their education."""

"First time skydivers often blank out most of the jump because of sensory overload. There is so much going on that the brain seems to say 'enough' and it switches off. Personally, I had a bad accident a couple of years ago. I have no recollection of the few seconds before the accident, and I suspect that was a similar effect. It's as though the brain has a limit on the amount of bad information it can take in."

I am a firm believer in physical activity and nowadays a lot of people my age (15) would rather stay home and watch Netflix and ignore physical activity. This module was great, and I agree with everything that was said in this module."
"One of the arguments of this report which riveted me was the idea that while educating adolescent boys is also important, education provides a particular protective value for adolescent girls due to the unique risks that they face during this period. In addition, evidence suggests that education can be instrumental in promoting gender equality. These observations seem to suggest to an even greater degree the need for a rights-based approach to girls education. Educating adolescent girls is not only beneficial in terms of long-term returns to society, but is also contributes to the realization of girls human rights."
"Hi Swati and Frederick,"
"Interesting discussion.  In the UK, I had predominantly female teachers at primary level then more of a mix at secondary level and university.  There has been a fair bit of panic in the UK in recent years about boys falling behind in education and some people attribute this to a lack of male teachers as role models - about a quarter of primary schools have no male teachers at all (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/<phoneRedac>/Teaching-in-primary-schools-still-seen-as-a-womans-job.html)."

The first shift I worked, when the tones went off for the first time, my stress response was immediate and high intensity.

"Well, they actually don't stay as healthy as those athletes who keep up the training. In module 3 Anne talked about the decline curve in athletes who stop the training, and it's really fast, going even faster to those who never actually excersized, and catching up with their low VO2. And in this class, she also quoted this 1990 paper that stated there are a lot of benefits to elderly people who became active. I don't think the body remembers, but the excercise these athletes are used to demands a change in their bodies to keep up. These changes aren't as stable as we would like to think, again like Anne said, if you stop your training, you go down."

"Yes, I agree that Corey's approach was good. My only comment, not really a criticism, is that in the next round of the course, he should emphasize that the stress relieving techniques, to really work, need a philosophical rethinking to life and practice and more practice - otherwise, they will come across to many as simply another Western \quick fix\"" which if it does not work right away, is discarded.

"My stab at answering this (but please correct me if I am wrong): if a student asks for credit, the bank knows that he is more likely to pay than a non-student for the same level of balance, but also that he is likely to run larger balances, and the general probability of larger balances being paid is smaller. So, not knowing what balance that particular student would run, it makes sense to be cautious about giving him a loan (and this is captured by the single-variate logistic regression with 'student' as predictor)."

A lot of great info in this section. I think in school they should teach people more about the many benefits of exercise and how far a little exercise will get you in life. Life altering stuff here.
As an athlete I think it is really interesting how a little hot or cold affects the performance of your muscles. Especially during VO2 max. In the past I have done many VO2 max tests and never thought about going in with warmed up muscles but a cooled down core. I'll try it next time.

And although the book pointed out many of the faults tainting most education systems in developing countries, like the relevance of curriculums to the girl's lives, and the gender prejudice that still many teachers maintain. The world is moving forward with many girls seeking education today more than ever. However i believe that  sexual education should also be implemented more strongly in schools, especially in countries where child marriages,and backwards practices like FMG are pervasive ."

Environmental sustainability, maternal health, sustainable economic development, even fighting disease all depend strongly on empowering Women.  In addition, any obstacles to reaching these goals, such as oppressive economic globalization efforts, poverty, trauma, lack of access to healthcare can only be met if Women are empowered by education to not only fight it but sustain their self-worth under degrading circumstances.  "
"Wow, free the children talks about this article!!"
Appropriately this module is during the week during which the international day for zero tolerance of Female genital mutilation / cutting falls.  These two brief articles poignantly depict a circumcision ceremony and describe the plight of a professional cutter who explains that without the cutting profession there will be no other way for cutters to make money and many will not plan on discontinuing their practices.  There is also a 7 minute video with interviews with villagers who defend the tradition and with those who reject the practice.

"Goals 1 and 6 are imperative for girl's access to education. As we read in the readings this week, women drop out due to their basic needs not being met and the fact that girls are depended upon for their labor and other familial and community roles and skills. If girls do not have access to basic life sustaining needs (i.e. Goal 1: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) and are highly susceptible to HIV via sexual abuse, human trafficking and female genital mutilation and cutting, or already infected with life threatening diseases  with a lack of access to healthcare, how can they have access to education (Goal 6)? It's not hard to see why education would be lower on the list of needs for these girls."
When I have taught students on this topic in the back of my mind is this sequence of ideas. 
"Certainly the setting of a refugee camp is unlikely to be conducive to gathering quality data.  I doubt that the data used in Cynthia's report includes data from displaced persons or refugee camps.  It is likely only applicable to relatively stable countries & populations.  I can only imagine that if families are already desperate and in dire financial straights, having been uprooted from their homes in times of conflict, that the more immediate monetary benefits of marrying off their daughters to keep the rest of the family fed & clothed would trump sending the girls to school with the hope that their earning potential and ability to contribute to the good of the community would be greater years down the line."

"With regard to culture and FGM, I am wondering if self-help groups conducted by local social workers have been effective.  In India in 2006 and 2010, I visited organizations that were addressing cultural and superstition issues through regular educational gatherings for women.  These gatherings addressed health and family planning, family violence, women's rights as well as some lighter issues that the women enjoyed."
"I was having the same issue as you and spent way longer than I probably should have figuring it out. Anyway, there were two issues that I ran into: first, the team variables have dashes and parentheses and such, which messes things up. Second, in the model you're predicting from, the 'homeAdv' variable is separate from the data frame X which contains the other variables. So when you run the predict function, you have to make sure to do it on a data frame that contains both 'homeAdv' as well as the variables contained in X."

"This first chapter was a perfect opening to stir up the outrage. It touches on the fact that women cannot escape the injustices of inequality throughout their lives. From even before birth to adulthood to old age, attacks don't discriminate but seek to destroy their power or remove it completely.

As hard as it may be to read some of these anecdotes and understand the depth of pain brought on our sisters, I'm excited to continue the journey toward building on courage_ the courage to help do something about it.

"All the readings were interesting in high lightening the transformative role of educating women in development, not only as a right we all should be entitled, but also the reasons why investing in girls is smart economics. Despite this course seeks to address women_s needs as an undeniable right that should be met in light of justice, my experience advocating for women_s equality, has proven that sometimes, economic arguments result in a more willing participation in changing women_s lives, rather than justice. Sad as it may be, advocacy among certain groups cannot be achieved easily without appealing to the economic benefits of equality. "

"From an American perspective, what I took away from this reading is that in the same way that we know restrictive laws do not lead to lower rates of abortion, the way to address gender-selective abortion is not through legislation. The key is education and a focus on a cultural shift in how girls are valued."
"I recall having similar high stress responses when I was a new EMT, responding for the first time. And still the middle of the night calls put me over the top because of the suddenness of going from sleep to action into the unknown mode. But over time, and with more experience, I noticed that this subsided somewhat. The stress never goes away, but I'd bet you'd find some EMTs and FF who'd tell you the stress is less intense as they gain experience and knowledge of how to deal with incidences. I no longer volunteer, so if I was to start again no doubt my stress response would be through the roof for awhile."
"I think for some, the \deep breathing\"" or \""yoga\"" probably works.  But I agree that sometimes just repetition of doing something (Ie, public speaking, skydiving, whatever) may also cause one to be more comfortable with it, thereby less stress.  None the less we have all heard of movie stars or public speakers stating they get nervous or \""stressed\"" every time they perform in front of others.  IOW, I think we all find coping mechanisms to push through the stress. But I also believe one has to go into a method with an open mind or acceptance that of making it work.  I guess I'd call that the placebo affect."""

Great conversation about the history of the way we are attempting to move forward (not my area of expertise or background). I appreciate the differentiation about the way that governments can report as well as allowing NGOs to also submit data about human rights.
"We have a normal mixture whose trial probabilities (pi) are different that 1/2, the probabilities in the previous slide. As far as I can see the two densities, with their new weights, cannot possibly cross each other at the same point they crossed when their weights were 1/2. To me, they should cross to the left of zero, the initial crossing point."
"Note that in bootstrap you are allowed to sample the same point multiple times. For instance one of the possible bootstrap data sets is obtained by a single point from the original data, but used n times."

"I was struck by the same thought.  From a human rights perspective, both girls and boys should have equal chances to obtain an education. We have learned through the readings that, while there is also a strong economic incentive for educating girls, this immediate economic consequences for families in terms of lost labor or school fees, often take priority on the level of individual families and communities. You point out, however, that there is also much more to educating girls than economics, otherwise there would be no reason for killing the father of a girl who went against cultural norms to fight for an education.  There would be no reason for little girls like Malala to be shot for daring to pursue an education.  There must also be a strong fear of the capabilities of girls and women.  Otherwise why would there be so many obstacles purposefully aimed to keep girls from accessing equal education to boys. We really haven't touched on this in the course yet, but I remember one of my college anthropology courses touched on the idea that keeping children from accessing education prevents them from learning to think critically and keeps them from pushing for social change. The example I remember was The Lord's Resistance Army in the DRC, and how these children were used because they were uneducated, lacked a sense of belonging to their community, and were easily brainwashed into ruthlessly complying with orders from military leaders.  They lacked the capacity to resist their superiors and were very easy to manipulate into embracing their new roles in the army. While this example is not directly applicable to reason why girls are limited and denied education, it does suggest that a contributing factor could be the desire of male elders in the community to control and limit the social clout of women."
"There are many goodwills all around the world who believe in the education of girls and incorporating women into the work force. But in reality, these results are not achieved. I think governments should provide incentives to encourage these girls to go to school. Encourage women to enter vocational trainings and we will begin to see higher and better results"
"In the normal bootstrap, yes.  But the way I understand this question is that this is *not* the normal bootstrap.  Note the statement in the question, \Unlike the usual implementation of the bootstrap, this method has the advantage of not introducing extra noise due to resampling randomly.\""  So the bootstrap samples produced here must all have the same data points in them but in different order.  If this were not the case than the number of bootstrap samples of an original data set of n size could theoretically be infinite."""

"In Senegal Italian development cooperation has financed a project on girls' education focusing on primary school.

"I want to give an example of something which happened in my country (Italy). Until recently, rape was a \crime against the public moral\"". I mean until 1981 if I am not mistaken. After this, the law changed and stated that rape was a crime against the person, the individual person. I don't actually know if the punishment changed accordingly or became more serious or anything, I guess it did, anyway. But to me, personally it makes a huge difference knowing that my country believes that raping me is a problem of public morality, or that raping me is a crime against me. It means that to my country I am worth something and that what I feel is worth something, and not that it is \""inappropriate\"" towards the society raping me. This, IMO, is a case where the human rights lens has been applied whereas, beforhand, it had not. It does make a difference, to me."""

The girls I work with can not begin to understand the hardships of their peers across the world.  Yet they struggle daily with the demands society has placed upon them. They come from middle class families where food, shelter and their physical needs are met. They still battle to define the person they want to become and many are so very unhappy. I would like to help them find their inner value and know they can be so much more."

In dealing with high school athletes of all different levels it is hard to get them to be serious about focus and meditation techniques. One person in the group can ruin it for the whole team by not taking the practice serious. I am not sure which tool it would be considered 1 or 2 but I have come up with a practice that helps over nervous young athletes. I have them pick a few songs that they like on the ipod or cd and I have them turn the sound down so they can hear the music but can't make out what the singer is saying. They relax and focus on the singer. After a while they can hear the singer very well and all of the focus is on the song and away from the stresser. The technique has been very useful with athletes that are too nervous. The only draw back is that with the improved focus on the song you might hear all the imperfections of the singer and no longer like that singer or song. It is a way to use something that they are very in tune with to help them.

"An underestimated obstacle in girls'education in my country, Democratic Republic of Congo, is the way that girls judge themselves.

Her body becomes her ultimate advantage.This utopia is rooted in poor and less poor families.  Instruction could strengthen the self-respect and help girls to understand that their intelligence and their judgment are not lower at all than those of the boys. "

"As already mentioned in other posts, MDG 2 and 3 mention specifically the education fo girls as a goal to be achieved. The achievement of MDG 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 is also directly dependent on the improvement of education for girls and higher school attendance rates for girls. However, I argue that also MDG 8 cannot be achieved without the inclusion of women who are aware of their needs, interests and rights. Hence, one precondition of the success of the MDGs is the fundamental equality between genders which empowers and enables women to participate in decision-making processes."
"This is an excellent question.  And while I claim no real insight, I think one thing has to be reducing the intimidation factor.  So, the goal is not to adopt an intensive program, but instead small steady steps from where they are (whoever that may be) to something better.  And I found the seminal study on potential amazing:  in 8 weeks, a group of frail, inactive 90 year old people increased their strength by 178%.  There is a HUGE opportunity for improvement in the quality of life, let along health."
"But all too often HIV-positive people become targets of AIDS discrimination and stigma. On top of handling new health challenges, they sometimes face rejection by family and friends. They may be forced out of homes, lose jobs, or even become victims of violence. Unfortunately, AIDS discrimination and stigma also fuel the epidemic. They prevent people from talking about their HIV status with sex partners or people with whom they share needles. Fear of rejection and worries about confidentiality also prevent many from getting tested for HIV. This means they may spread HIV to others without knowing it.Many factors can lead to AIDS discrimination and stigma: HIV is a deadly disease that many people fear. Some adults still wrongly believe that they can catch HIV through casual contact, such as sharing a drinking glass or touching a toilet seat. This greatly increases their fear about being near people who are infected. Many people connect HIV and AIDS with behaviors that are already stigmatized, such as sex between men or injecting drugs. Some people believe that having HIV or AIDS is the person's own fault. For example, they might think it's the result of moral weakness and deserves to be punished."

"Agreed. As the 'son preference' content of Class 2 makes clear, there are some forms/manifestations of sexism that can only be addressed by changing the way girls' fundamental value as human beings is perceived, and that can only come about by looking at issues like education as matters of human rights."
"I have a hard time wrapping mind around these MDGs, mostly because they seem to be based heavily on theory and not so much practice. However this is probably matter for another discussion. What is of concern here is what role does the education of girls plays in the fulfillment of these goals. Given what we know from the readings the goals that most directly relate to girls' education are goals 2, 4 and 5. Girls' education is key if we want to achieve universal primary education. Reducing child mortality and improving maternal health can be achieved by educating girls, according to Summers from the World Bank, it takes just 5 years of education to save a life of a child in Africa. As far as all the rest of the goals, I don't think they relate directly to girls' education, although they may indirectly. Goal 1 for example can relate directly to girls' education but not enough to garner significant change. I think that may have to do with the fact that there are countries that have high rates of poverty and girls are educated. I believe there are other factors that create and perpetuate poverty and hunger. Same goes for the spread of HIV/AIDS etc, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a partnership for development. Goal 3 is another goal that is directly related to girls' education, and I think it is as obvious as goal 2. "
"I experienced son preference within my own family, though not to the exclusion of food, medical care or education.  I cannot imagine what it must be like in a country where those choices are made against a female child.  I only have two daughters and praise God for them as they are a complete blessing.  I was taught that girls were trouble and boys more reasonable.  Maybe girls have the innate desire to understand and I know I will be better off in my old age."

"In developing countries, I would like to see more teacher training/health and nutrition training/ doula or midwife training and general medical/dental education target for young women specifically so that they have a needed career for the care of their children which gives them self respect and a respected place in their community.  I also feel that general education for both males and females should encompass basic reading, writing and math, caring for household finances and sex/relationship education including the need to eradicate violence in familial relationships and the frightful rise in STD's and HIV/AIDS.  We could also use these things in developed countries in the areas of ignorance and poverty."
I think that is an excellent way of going about things.
"My favourite ski resort is Les 2 Alpes in the the French Alpes which is an interesting sports at altitude experience. The lower parts of the resort are at a modest <zipRedac>300m (most of the village is around <zipRedac>650m) but the top of the lifts is over 2km higher at 3568m (one of the biggest, and arguably the biggest regularly skiable in one go, lift served on piste vertical descents in the world) but AMS is almost never a problem because while people are happily heading up to close to <zipRedac>2000ft several times a day they quickly head down to much lower altitude, even a day on the glacier will probably be only be 5 or 6 hours at altitude (though doing a good deal of exercise) before heading much lower."

"There seems to be a consensus among many of the posts that goals 2 and 3 related directly to girls' education. That is my opinion as well. Goals 1, 4-8 are more a product that comes from education in general. It would be naive, however, to think that any of the goals could be reached 100% without proper, quality education for half the world's population. I think the goals are appropriate for the entire world because they are intended to raise the quality of life of everyone, but are not necessarily geared toward creating a non-diverse world. I hope that I am not missing something when I say that the goals aren't enforcing a western telos."

'Women's education has prevented 4million child deaths in the past 40 years'.
"The goals that relate directly to girl's education are; goal 2 which is achieving universal primary education and goal 3 which is promoting gender equality and empowering women.The goals that are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment are; goal 1 which is eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, goal 4 which is reducing child mortality, goal 5 which is improving maternal health, goal 6 which is combating HIV and AIDS and other major diseases, goal 7 which is ensuring environmental sustainability and goal 8 which is developing a global partnership for development."
I think the key thing is that you are able to cope - everyone's pain threshold is different so there is no defined point where surgery become inevitable you are the person who decides 'I can no longer cope and need assistance'. My mother's surgeon was surprised at how degenerated her hip had got before she decided it was time for her second replacement but she was able to cope with the pain it was the instability that made her mind up.
MDGs 2 and 3 are the most directly related to girls' education. Clearly universal primary school must be achieved in order to address girls' empowerment and gender equality.

One of the problems he experienced was when he went into a spin and experienced high G forces. While the effect on Felix was not an altitude one, it was an altitude problem in that the very low air density meant that he could not exert control over his movements by adjusting his body to the airflow as he would have done at lower altitudes."

"Actually superiority over women were normal for a long time and for our men-ancestors that was not something huge and not normal to be leaders. That was natural to be a commander and the one who rules. But quite another thing when this outgrows in violence. It happens when someone feels more powerful and think that he can do whatever he wants. Generally it's more common among weak men who just think he is strong. Unfortunately many countries now suffering from these type of persons but it's not the biggest problem of our century. More woefully is when women can't show that they are strong. I'm very happy that all over the world we have more and more organization that helps women to feel their power and be safe.

"I believe that goals 2 and 3 relate directly to girls¡¯ education.  In achieving universal primary education, all girls will have completed priamry level education, although as discussed in the lectures, the quality of this education and its relevance to today¡¯s world may be questionable.

We have just learned how severely these women lack resources, how abusive their husbands can be, and how they already have so many mouths to feed without the funding -- how can it be expected, then, that they'll also have the ability to take care of their aging parents?

I had taken the kids to the library and met a group of women from China who were visiting and observing preschool situations in the US. One of the ladies was pregnant and was enjoying sitting with my daughter and reading to her. She said she was pregnant with a boy and wished she had a girl. It made me really sad that she may only have one child, and being a woman who seemed like she would have raised a girl in a good way, she instead is contributing to the ratio of more boys than girls in China. (Not that she could control what the gender was...unless there was a past of regrets of a lost girl that I will never know about...)

Social/non-medical interventions that might be effective in preventing or treating HIV/AIDS: 
"The convergence of VO2 max helps make sense of a personal experience for me. I have always been a \recreational\"" athlete (at best) and I also enjoy climbing peaks. When I hiked up Mount Whitney (14,494' when I was there, but apparently now measured at 14,505'), I had been living at 7,000' and spent the night at Whitney Portal (8,360') and did the summit as an overnight, staying at Trail Camp (12,000') before going to the summit and hiking out the next day. It felt like a piece of cake. Easy trail - the switchbacks going to Trail Crest were \""treadmill\"" switchbacks rather than \""stairmaster\"" ones, but I stopped and took a drink and ate a bit of salty snack every 10 switchbacks (of the 90-something - so about 9-10 short breaks to keep fuel and water levels up) whether I felt I needed to or not. At the top, I passed big strong-looking guys who looked MUCH more fit who were sitting with their heads down, looking really bad. I just figured it was because they hadn't acclimated, maybe were doing it in a single day, etc, but their improved fitness would have made their VO2 max fall more rapidly than mine, too. "

**Which goals relate directly to girls¡¯ education? Which goals are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment?**
"I currently work for an INGO in Guatemala city, with strong projects at community levels.  Currently, I have been assigned new responsibilities that include working with women and including a gender lens into our program activities. This seems to be a very interesting and exciting way to learn and share with others."
"I think that this is a really thought provoking and powerful document. I think there would be benefits to expanding it though to consider what areas girls and boys are encouraged to pursue in education. Girls tend to be urged into liberal arts while boys dominate in science and mathematics. This gender divide creates further problems and serves to embed stereotypes which posit women as less able in certain fields than men. This causes more men to enter professions traditionally considered to be more valuable. While getting girls into education is of course the first step, once girls are in schools they should be motivated by peers and teachers to pursue the same subjects boys pursue and vice versa. There are arguments which say that it is biological factors which mean that there is a gender divide but I actually think that this kind of essentialising is dangerous and damaging. False gender divides disempower women."

"I am especially interested in the fact that psychosocial distress was amongst the greatest concerns for Ghanian women in Avotri and Walters' paper, \We Women Worry a Lot about our Husbands.\"" It is refreshing to see that health can be viewed as something far greater than simply absence of disease. The WHO has a more inclusive definition of health (a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity), but this is often overlooked in most conversations about health. Even in the public health arena, women's health is assumed to be reproductive or maternal health. Psychological or social well-being is often cast aside as less important, or harder to grasp and therefore easier to sidestep, but wouldn't this be the greatest reason above all to delve further into the understanding, prevention and treatment of these deeper issues?"""

"Like you, I am also in awe that the United States does not have more women in our federal government.  It is especially shocking because the United States refuses to ratify or sign on to most international treaties, like CEDAW, that promote human rights and women's rights.

See the first reply to the following question:
"The writing of history and the singular perspective of it struck me. Most leaders in history have been men and then the history about these men was also written by men, because the writers of history were men. This creates a 'double blind' towards the role of women in historical events. This also means that the story we know and identify with, about ourselves, our country, our community, lacks to a large extend this female perspective. I guess I never thought about it in that way before. And it also occurs to me that the story we are living today is still predominantly interpreted by men - in larger and lesser extends depending on the country."

"Hello Enlighten,"
The readings for this week are quite informative. A lot was explained and clarified in terms of enrollment versus attendance. The data presented painted a clear picture of the situations globally but also pointed to the hope of things getting better. I was pleased by the increase (albeit slow) enrollment rates of girls and appreciated the argument which spoke not only of the economic benefit but also the social gains of educating females. What struck me was the data showing that on average Latin America and the Caribbean had overall more females enrolled in schools than males and it would be interesting to get a better understanding and have a discussion around why this is the case in this region. 
<redacted>: 
"The goals that relate directly to girls education are Goal 2 (universal primary education) and Goal 3 (gender equality and promoting empowerment through reducing gender disparity in the education). The previous readings (Chapter 3 in From Outrage to Courage and Chapters 1-3 in New Lessons) point to progress in this area with a number of countries moving towards free education being available at the Primary level. What is of interest to note is that this is also being made a reality in the development arena by the enforcement by lending agencies as part of the criteria for receiving developmental loans.  Forced or encouraged the goal of universal primary education is on the increase. Also with the introduction of feeding programs within schools (as was mentioned in previous readings) the goals directly related to girls education is being realized with the added incentive which promotes enrollment and possibly sustains attendance. With the growth of non-formal schooling, these goals have also being realized, however the challenge is documenting this hidden population and understanding its reach and impact on educating girls. "
I am very much looking forward to the course and hope I can catch up quickly what I missed. The first readings already showed me that this course will not stop at describing inequalities but also present actions to remedy them which is very valuable information. I hope we can have fruitful discussions and exchange experiences during these 8 weeks.

"In previous lessons we have learned that educating women is beneficial in countless ways, I think that in order to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS there should be a focus on the education of men in this area. Sex education should be implemented in schools, and safe sex should be a major focus. I don't think we can fully combat this disease by only educating women. Men have to know that in most cases they are the ones infecting their partners putting their wives, partners, and children at risk. "

"My thoughts are that it takes some time for the body to react to the change in oxygen available.  I have definitely experienced an \altitude hangover\"" where we try to tag a summit quickly, but will be hit with some AMS symptoms on the way down.  Likewise, it can take a few hours to feel better after descending.  This is why it's important to try to stay ahead of AMS - eat before you are hungry, drink before you are thirsty, really moderate your pace to make sure you are not pushing it too hard (to a point where your body has to work hard to recover, yet your recovery is compromised with less oxygen)."""

It has improved over the last twenty years though, I hope to see more changes to come to South Korea and to the world."

"The issue of HIV/AIDS prevention is very complex not only because of the illness itself but because of the varied contexts it exists and spreads. Prevention strategies need to be tailored to the community and the culture of the people they target.

Considering that HIV/AIDS thrives in places where there are large disparities in gender equality, targeting prevention activities only to the most powerless will have little effect. Thus my proposed prevention strategies are as follows:"

"The US by taking this stance shows great hypocrisy. The message to women and children of the US is that we don't really agree with the treaties that give  you equal rights. There are lots of countries in the world where human rights standards are low, but there are no trade sanctions against them, and in fact can be generous loans and assistance. As a superpower it is a shame that the Us can't be a leader for women and children."

"I worked in a midwifery program in Australia a while back. The state health system was trying to address and deal with domestic violence, knowing the serious impact it has on the unborn child, the mother, family and community. All midwives, child health nurses and other professionals were given a thorough workshop before starting to use a Domestic Violence tool, which was designed to a identify domestic violence on first contact to teh health service. So at the first antenatal visit the woman is asked four easy questions as well as given a short information session about the impact of DV. AS a manager I often did chart audits, and often found these forms were not filled in. EVen after many antenatal visits these forms were often not filled in.DV being such a hidden subject, we are still not taking it in as part of the whole person, forms are not being filled in not only by the antenatal midwives, but also by other health professionals who attend woman at some stage in their pregnancy and postnatal period.  I spoke to the midwives and they all said that they felt embarrassed and that they felt it was too confronting. They were concerned that women would not come back to the service, and that they had to develop a close relationship before they could ask the questions. They did however, feel comfortable to discuss vaginal discharges, bowel habits,drug use, diet etc. When there was a death of a young mother from out of control domestic violence in our area, her chart showed she was not asked the questions after receiving full antenatal and postnatal care at the service. I did not see any improvement with the forms being filled out after this incident. More inservice was done to address the issue, with some temporary improvement. So if midwives can't address DV and change with knowledge and regulation..how must a young woman in a power over relationship feel."

"As has been discussed, of course, the United States has signed but not ratified CEDAW. I found the reasons discussed in the video to be very interesting. I am in agreement with the statement that the U.S. doesn't want to surrender its sovereignty of laws to the international system. However, I find it simultaneously both totally ridiculous and somewhat believable that part of the reason the U.S. hasn't ratified CEDAW is an old-fashioned view of family values and the ongoing dialogue in this country about abortion. While I can see how some people would believe CEDAW is pro-abortion, I'm not sure that in 1980 America was in the same place in the national discussion about abortion as it is now. I find it more likely that the U.S. didn't want to be subject to NGOs being able to monitor its progress and other countries being able to ensure that CEDAW is enforced."
"I am a dual citizen of the United States and Nigeria. I find it quite interesting that Nigeria has signed and ratified CEDAW but the United States has yet to. From the link provided above, I see that Nigeria has not put into place any declarations or reservations against the treaty. As one of the leading nations in the world and a country idealized by many other countries, the USA should've, in my opinion, been one of the first countries to ratify the treaty. Though I believe that the those nations that ratified CEDAW are able to effect the change which the treaty calls for, having the US, with its many resources, could possibly effect even more change as an official backer."
Monitoring progress is possible even without CEDAW in the case of the United States because that data is available independently. I wonder though if it is not symptomatic of the fact that there was (and still is) such a low percentage of women in positions of real power politically be it locally or at a national level. Look at the not so recent conversations before the 2012 election regarding women's reproductive rights and how vitriolic the attacks were against Sandra Fluke from prominent male figures and just how little other powerful men did to protect her. Would the those hearings have happened at all (let alone the hostile tone of the hearings) had there been women in those committees? Or even had there been more women in Congress? Say around 50% of the total number of persons in those positions?

"Having read chapter 2,the son preference to be honest did bleed my heart just thinking of what those parents put these innocent fragile little baby girls through. Where has their conscience gone? And these infanticides are carried out mostly in secrets hence no tangible records of such infant deaths."
"The son preference issue is also a pointer to some of the ways women are being treated, tortured and discriminated against in their homes and families in which she is married into especially if she has mostly female children. Some of their husbands will go as far as having extra marital affairs in order to have a son and if he succeeds in having a son outside of his matrimonial home, will later marry the woman in question as a second wife."

I also want to note I find the \feminization of poverty\"" is seen on a large scale yet I find it interesting that in the Global North often poverty campaigns have been sensationalized to be masculine.

"I am late to the game here and working on catching up.  One of the things I love about adding women's rights to human rights is the larger context with which people can see what is right and wrong. I so appreciate Ann's simple explanation that yes, education for girls is good for the economy and country but also that it is the right thing to do.  There is so much struggle with giving reasons of why people should be treated equally - long documents as we have read, long discussions, arguments, misunderstandings, etc - when really it boils down to it is the right thing to do.  I am also very interested in learning more about human/sex trafficking as it relates to corporate and business structures. This is something that confounds me beyond what I can comprehend that this continues in this modern day.  Looking forward to learning more and having more eye opening experiences."
"Thank you Ann for your comment and answers. We had a curriculum developed in-house on the basis of existing body of knowledge on the rights of women and the girl child including reports and concerns of the cultural text in which the project was undertaken. The curriculum included, the concept of womanhood, impact of igbo culture, patriarchy, development of women and igboland, women's human rights and limitations to equal participation and leadership, son preference and disparities in education, health, economy and inheritance, role of religion, human rights instruments (CEDAW, Protocol to the ACHPRRWA etc), successful igbo women in leadership positions amongst others.

Such a great interview. I remember reading in chapter one - I think it was - that women in developing countries prefer the US to sign this than get money for services - to show an example to the world of what is right.  I am obviously paraphrasing - poorly at that.  I so appreciate the discussion about countries signing CEDAW and then not really being able to act upon or simply not willing to act upon it.  AND I so appreciate Helen's long term optimism.  It does seem like good grief how is this ever going to change - how do you shift cultural perceptions that have been around for hundreds of years - perceptions people cling to like survival - and yet we have seen it done.  I'm so appreciative knowing that both Ann and Helen are teaching the next generation - and me!

"What you mention SarahFB is - I believe - why the US won't sign. Yes, the whole American values things but also that the government here doesn't  want any other country or group telling it what to do.  Like American law before International law.  But I think that is why they have the objections section - to maintain that which is most sacred to the government I suppose.  I wish the US would just do something similar to get the ball rolling."

"Cheyne Stokes respiration has central apnea as a component. The central apneas are due to low levels of CO2 and the faster component is due to higher CO2 levels (increased respirations to blow off CO2) . BiPAP settings can be adjusted (the 'spread' between the two pressures) to control how much CO2 is blown off during a breath - that is how it addresses the problem. For someone who has Cheyne Stokes respirations, bilevel is not the preferred mode of treatment. Adaptive Servo Ventilation looks at airway restriction (to address any obstructive apneas) and also looks at lung volumes (to address low volumes due to central apneas)and automatically adjusts the pressures accordingly. Incidentally, PAP treatment does not bypass sensory information- it changes the environment and thus, changes what the sensors perceive."

"The readings on HIV/AIDS are timely for me.  I¡¯m traveling in March to Ethiopia to visit refugee camps and will be learning specifically about programs that serve adolescent girls. In preparation for the trip I came across a study that was done in rural Ethiopia (in the Amhara region) that involved in-depth interviews and a survey of 1,000 young people aged 10-19.  There were a few questions aimed to measure the respondents¡¯ understanding of HIV/AIDS, particularly their exposure to messages conveyed through lectures in and out of school, dramas, and radio messages. I was not surprised to learn that the boys who responded were significantly more likely to hear these messages than girls. "
"I think the end of the chapter - re. Japan - is to show that girls are being valued in a different way - yes, it might be for caretaker at the moment but it is a value shift - which might turn out to create gender equality in the long run."
"One other thing I forgot to note in my earlier post is that it may be worth considering providing HIV/AIDS information to \johns\"" (e.g. men - and some women - who frequent sex workers). I understand the structural and systemic reasons that lead men/women to choose (or be forced into) sex work as a way to generate income, but as a person whose background is in the human trafficking field, I¡¯m categorically opposed to sex work as a concept (NOT to the sex workers themselves).  "
The duffle bag incident tore me down.  I know it is circumstances and being raised a particular way that would create someone to behave that way.  It's very angering but the whole system - that men who would do such a thing grew up how they did to make it ok for them to do something like that.

"Yes - I agree with you on this.  It makes complete and total sense to me and yet I understand the fear of some in the US who are afraid of the government getting too much power - I don't think that will happen but it does seem like creating a system where everyone can thrive without worry for healthcare, where people can have easy access to high quality education if that's what they choose to do, can only benefit everyone in the long run.  Listening to this talk made me excited about government and the UN - it squashed a little bit of my general cynicism about it all.  I do know that there are people within the government - the US government -  who really do want to create a better world for all of us here.  "

"As <redacted> <redacted> emphasized; medical intervention alone is not merely enough to prevent a diseases that strikes the most unprivileged hardest. There are deeper roots to the AIDS endemic, rather than what most biomedical doctors, and medical practitioners will often see. Thus AIDS -in a great percent- is an outcome of a deeper problem; which is known as structural violence. However, most official bodies focus on the local factors and the effects of the endemic, rather than the collective social image that binds most AIDS high risk, and infected groups together; which is their social ranking as the bottom rung of the social ladder. "

"When I traveled in South India, studying women's health care, I was taken by the number of male children/babies who were dressed like girls with jewelry etc. When I asked a native regarding this practice, I was told that the mothers were trying to trick the gods into thinking the child was a girl so that they would not try to take him. This was many years ago, but at the time there was much talk about infanticide and the value of male children to families. It was the time when there was state funded sterilization programs which of course, brought child value discussions even more to the forefront. I am not surprised that son preference practices are still common but I find it sobering. Being born female is dangerous for many. I do not think I have put the fact of son preference into my file for gender disparity before but I see that it definitely needs to be defined as such."

"Gene Richardson¡¯s extensive research into social interventions has been excellent food for thought in terms of focusing on structural interventions as opposed to the commonly used biomedical interventions for treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS.  Shifting from the medical lens that is so often used to view these problems, to the alternate lens of social means based on data analysis of widely available statistics from the United Nations Development Program, provided insights into ways to arm ourselves against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  The idea that structural interventions could be more effective in the war against HIV/AIDS could potentially open more doors for prevention and treatment while simultaneously working to reduce the disparity in gender inequality and improve education."

Listening to these talks prompt me to consider structural violence as a direct cause of illness in a way that I had not done before. I suppose I knew on some level that what can be termed structural violence (stress, environmental pollution, and hygiene) are often not in the control of those who are economically and socially disempowered, but I did not have the terminology to describe the phenomenon. Several years ago, I volunteered for a nonprofit organization that participated in environmental advocacy on the behalf of disenfranchised individuals living in urban areas just outside of Boston, Massachusetts. I learned that the rates of asthma in children who lived near a hub of the public buses and school bus parking lots were much higher than those of children in other neighborhoods. Looking back, I can see that lack of access to clean air and institutionalized racism linked with poverty would be the main contributors to the children's asthma."

"In the first lab Corey was exposed to the equivalent of 10,000 ft. The elevation at the top of Pikes Peak is over 14,000 ft. I believe I experienced some minor altitude issues at 6,000 ft., but I also had an underlying health issue at the time. What I am reading on the subject from a healthcare web site is that it is generally thought 6,500 ft. is where most can expect some change, and that a certain percentage of people who ascend more than 8,000 ft. in a day are at real risk. It does not surprise me to learn that children are especially susceptible, but it does surprise me to learn that the risk is twice as high for people under the age of 60. For those of us who hike and who, in my case, sometimes take people hiking, this information is really helpful. The mountains east of the Mississippi are all below 7,000 ft. So no one is likely to experience acute symptoms here, but for some I would imagine the elevation at which they will begin to expect a change in the way they feel is lower than the above 6,500 ft. I currently live near the coast. The highest hike I have led so far was about 2,000 ft. There will be more in the future at higher elevations though. This information is very valuable in that it will help me to know what I need to ask each perspective participant, and how to plan. I would love to hear from anyone about experiences they have had, or advice they would be willing to give on the subject."

These girls will make decisions for their lives and they will know their rights to choose what they want to pursue and have the confidence to choose who to marry and when to marry - they will learn not to circumcise their children, pursue economic empowerment and use their income wisely on their families. Education & gender empowerment is key"

"Hello,"
Thank you Doc Friedlander that is really helpful. My back up explanation was that with increased SNS (at least in the classic situations of fight or flight or in exercise) the increased venous return would see increased end diastolic volume and so the Frank Starling mechanism would kick in and the force of contraction would compensate for the decreased filling time. From what you say it's more subtle than that
I would be very interested in the underlying mechanism the reduction in plasma volume in response to hypoxia. Is it reduced water reabsorption only or reduced electrolyte AND water reabsorption?

"Hi,"
"The most effective social/non-medical intervention that can be used to prevent and/or treat HIV/AIDS is education.  While this intervention may enjoy a fair amount of theoretical support, it is practical access to education, for girls and boys, that is required.  Education provides a communal level of understanding for students to discover how HIV is spread and how it can be prevented.  Within a community, this knowledge is shared, as well as the power of the knowledge.  Additionally, students learn while at school to navigate socially; they learn to confidently debate, argue, and compromise.  These are the communication skills that are needed to have the ¡°difficult conversations¡± concerning health and reproductive choices.  Aware of their increasing prospects through education, students may pause to have a risk/benefit analysis of behaviors that are associated with HIV acquisition."

About a year ago I went on the Wheat Belly Diet by Dr William Davis. No wheat or other GMO grains, no sugar or high fructose corn syrup, both also now made from GMO grains. After just 10 days, my knee pain was gone, aging joints were pain-free, my skin, hair, and health also improved dramatically. I now feel 20 years younger and at 68, after not running for at least 15 years, I am training for a 5K and expecting to do well.

"While Goal Two strives to achieve universal primary education, thus directly granting the right to education for girls, one may question whether access to primary education is sufficient to close the educational gap. Further efforts may focus on retention on female students past childhood into adolescence at a point when education may be a more powerful tool in safeguarding a girl's interests. Universal primary education is a giant step in the right direction, but it is in vain if a girl isn't able to stay within the safety net of school for her formative years, if it's just a childhood diversion. "

As Lloyd reported, there are evidences linking education particularly of women and girls with increased family income and gross national product (MDG 1), improved child and maternal health, as well as of gender equality. It is not far fetched to claim that women with education are better aware of how to prevent HIV transmission and more able to negotiate safe sex - especially if they have economic/financial independence and are empowered, and also better able to act in environmentally sustainable manner or contribute positively to environmental management. That is because they have achieved a certain level of capacity and status such that they are involved in community affairs."

I like his idea of the two armed study to compare the best structural approach to women's negotiating power. It is a medical approach to a social problem and designed in a way that perhaps will communicate the social impact of this disease more easily to medical people. Dr. Farmer is another medical provider who has a good understanding of the personal/social impact of disease, in this instance, HIV.I have worked many years in Harlem and have come face to face with the many difficulties of providing adequate, proactive care to women in poverty. Empowerment is the key but it is one of the biggest challenges if you are the only one in their world preaching empowerment."
We think we fixed the little snafoo. Does it work for y'all now? Please let us know.
"I was struck, while reading Dr. Farmer's account of poor women struggling with the realities of their lives, that fatalism plays a big part in their ability to affect their lives. These women feel, for whatever reason, that they have no power over their lives, beaten down not only by their own surroundings but by cultural myths, religion (\It is in God's hands\""or \""God will take care of it\"" or as in Brazil-\"" If God desires it\""..)and experience which reinforces their lack of power over their life/decisions. In much of their life, they do not make decisions as let life happen to them, it rolls over them and knocks them down. This is their reality."""
"Good luck Sherfani! I am an OB/GYN nurse practitioner in the US with many years of experience working with women-mostly marginalized populations. It has been an amazing ride. I have learned so much from my patients about life. I hope the same for you, that you will be enriched by the women you care for."
"With respect to criminalizing dowries, it has been proven that making something illegal doesn't solve the problem. In poorer, rural areas, there exists a complex nexus of problems (lack of proper birth control, lack of adequate resources, negative views about female earning/working potential and hence, difficulty getting females married)."

Yay!!!!! Congratulations!

"Pros: Very informative, a lot of technical terms introduced yet lectures flowed naturally and were easy to follow.  I definitely enjoyed watching the field trips Professor Friedlander and Corey took. "
"Thanks guess how hot cold altitude and all the rest are affected by age (not just ageing, how it impacts my kids, 49 yo me, and me skiing the high mountains in my 70s would be great to look at as well)"
"Thank you for making this class possible. The information will be useful in the future and the way you presented it made me look forward to each week's module. And, now for some exercise!"
Like this?
"Yeah, you are right! I test it with the R3,too. It seems reasonable. Thank you!"
Thank you!
"Yeah, the RNG will influence the result but here I just misunderstood what the question is trying to ask."

I thought Gene Richardson highlighted many good social/non-medical interventions that can be implemented in societies around the world where there is major gender inequality. 
Thanks.
"No worries.  I know there has been talk about him perhaps receiving a Nobel and I thought maybe I had missed it somehow.  Nevertheless, he is certainly one of the great minds of out time."
I enjoyed too :)
I think this infographic is just brilliant. It shows so clearly how vital it is to educate a girl. And I also think it's an incredible way to spread the message; I 'pinned' this on Pinterest yesterday and have already received 5 likes and 7 repins - it goes to show how fast a message can be spread - let us just hope it reaches the right people.
"Thanks for that. It's very helpfull to me, since i have to use SAS on my Job."

"After reading this thread of responses, I believe I am more surprised by the surprise of those who were unaware that the US has not ratified CEDAW.  Only last year, we struggled to ratify VAWA - Violence Against Women Act - on the basis that the ratification would include Native Americans, homosexuals, and immigrants.  Those who've been involved in the US criminal justice system know that, although still deeply flawed in terms of implementation/enforcement, VAWA has been instrumental in protecting women from sexual and domestic based crimes.  So too ERA has not been ratified at the federal level.  I agree, it is a disappointment, especially when we consider our own Eleanor Roosevelt's efforts in the movement for international human rights - what would Eleanor say?!"
Are there meds to modify that? can you practice by just moving head side to side and back and forth and get used to the g's?
"If it is true that acceleration in one area tends to boost progress in the others, and if it is true that the struggle to get girls into secondary education is more difficult to achieve than primary education, and if it is true that education is the magic bullet for development, then I would suggest that MDG 3 is the umbrella goal that would underscore and support the achievement of the others."
"I am so glad to see on both the Action Kenya and the Gatoto sites a focus on disability.  I've not scanned all the threads to date, but I've not seen a discussion on disability rights and human rights yet. I hope there will be more discussion on this topic in future weeks."

"I read an interesting statistic the other day, that when told by a trusted professional that you must change X or it will kill you, only 9% of people actually will make any meaningful change!

Same here. I would love to join in but will most likely start only Wednesday evening.
Thanks a lot
"Also, as far as I understand (but could be wrong), in the univariate case $R^2 = r^2$, i.e. the square root of the $R^2$ statistic is the correlation between $x$ and $y$."

"It sounds like you have had some great treks. 5,500 meters! Wow! I once did a hike of only a few thousand feet, but because I live so close to sea level and knew some of my participants were likely to be much younger, I trained hard. Unfortunately I came down with a sinus infection just a week prior to the hike. Oxygen depletion can be really challenging at elevation. I had to stop several times. Fortunately several of the participants happened to work in the medical field so they were very understanding. I can only imagine how things would have gone if either of us had not tried our best to train. Kudos, I am in awe!"
"There is so much clear evidence that educating girls is beneficial for everyone, that you would hope by now it would be a \no-brainer\"". What really struck me was the question: \""if we have all this good data about the benefits of educating girls, why aren't we?\"" and I think so much of it comes down to culture. Not only do we need to have the services, formal and non-formal education and the data to back it up, but we also need to have societies and cultures that value women so that they can fully take advantage of these services."""
My reading of tsboot() is that the statistic function does not take the same
Thank you for your response! You have been very helpful. I appreciate all of the participant responses as well. Their experiences are also an incredibly valuable resource.
"I agree that educating girls and giving them an opportunity will improve a countries economy and health. If women were educated they would never think that FGM is something sacred and holy. It made me sick to my stomach to just read about it, can't imagine putting someone through that. If these women were educated just a tiny bit, they would never imagine doing something like that to a girl. FGM basically destroy a person in every way possible and it's sad that a simple fact like this is not known by all women around the world."
"The goals directly related to girls' education are achieve universal primary education and promote gender equality and empower women. Educating girls will promote gender equality and empower women, since they will understand that they too are capable of doing work other than the traditional roles they have seen their mothers' and grandmothers' do for countless generations. "
doesn't have anything to do with the videos. look at the left side ofthe courseware at the bottom
I am encouraged to see that I am not the only one starting this course late. I am excited to learn more about women's health with a global perspective.  I am an RN and my entire career has been in this area.  I currently teach in an ADN program and want to bring what I learn back to my students
"Dr. Richardson expands the lens of the medical model for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. Thus, the reliance on a medical based for treatment without the consideration of environmental factors can cause further detriment. Both case studies provided in this section are great examples of social interventions for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. "
"There are two goals that are directly related to girls 'education: Goal 2 and 3. But if we look at the rest of the MG we realize the importance of educating girls in order to achieve these goals. In other words, if we are not able to achieve Goal 2 and 3 it will be almost impossible to conquer Goal 1,4,5,6."
"Been years since I have been diving, most of this is pretty familiar but the details gave me some more insight."
"Hello Grace,"
Hi:
"It was very interesting to re-access these 8 goals, which I have looked at many times before, using the lens created by the readings from this course. Though only goals 2 and 3 directly talk about girls and education, I feel all 8 goals are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment (some more directly than others)."
"This week's readings have been both crushing with regard to data, and exciting as outlooks toward the future are hopeful. I've always personally believed that education is the foundation of change and with these readings and studies on the investment in girls' education, it's a no-brainer. As Wanjinu mentions in the last video, education is a right. Our world will only become more enriched when we're equally educated and skilled. "
"Really great course Anne and Cory, thanks so much for the time, effort and passion that you put into it!"

"I tried scuba diving years ago, but I ended up having a panic attack, hyperventilated and, as I listened to the information in the lecture, I now realise that maybe I had a bit of gas toxicity.. I remember intense dizziness, disorientation and nausea.. Too bad I couldn't complete the dive and enjoy underwater beauty.."
"Thank you very much. I couldn't agree more, but sometimes it's so irritating how narrow-minded people can be in terms of some simple healthy behaviors. But you are right - we need to do our job as good as we can and provide the best possible example for the others :)"
Simply the best online course ever. I will miss the weekly new section of this course that I got so used to expecting every Tuesday morning ( in India ).

"What Global Justice Center does is really amazing, I wish we could have their analysis and projection of their work here in Armenia. I think this is a great start for cooperation with the organizations of the field. I liked her enthusiasm and the way she is involved in and dedicated to her work. Well done!"
"I liked the idea of what are really human rights. They really do not exist, it is really an idea in fact. Here comes my idea of having the ideology of human rights: if we can improve and accept the ideology we can make the world a better place to live. How great is to know that so much people are dedicating themselves to the implementation of an ideology, a new kind of ideology of human rights."
"In my country, Armenia, Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)is signed and ratified by the government. But even in this case we have no  law on Domestic Violence, which is very important from my opinion for every country to protect he well being and wealth of the families, especially for women and children. This is very crucial that HR perspective demands that we accept that providing the education for girls is, 1st of all, the point of their own individual human right."
Thank you for the amazing course. It has helped me in deciding that this is what I will do at University. It has been a pleasure listening to the two of you speak over the last few weeks and I have learnt a lot about the human body that is simply remarkable. So simply thank you!

I think it could be possible that the combination of sitting and the lowered pressure contribute to feet swelling. Sitting could bring blood flow to the feet and perhaps the lower than sea level pressure of the cabin puts less force on the feet.

"Public health still poses a very big challenge in most of the developing countries. I just got concerned about the Ghanaian case study where women are not put in health priority and because of the cultural belief as highlighted women remain in the center of problems. It is true to note that the case study is not only portraying what is happening in Ghana but a summary of what is common in most of African Countries. In Uganda too, women suffer more than men when it comes to easy access to a minimum health standard package by government. Despite the women¡¯s vulnerability, they are not support to solve their needs. Gender Based Violence is now very common and women are the most victims."

"Russia is a signatory of CEDAW. In July of 1980 the USSR signed the treaty, and in January of 1981 it was ratified. Originally there was one reservation regarding article 29(1), however this reservation was withdrawn on the 8th of March, 1989."

Hello!
"I agree - I think it is wonderful system to put into place - something about it reminds me of home schooling - which I know is different.  I think it is so important to acknowledge there are many ways to educate and many forms of education. Even for me, I come from the \the only option is to go to college\"" system - which I did - and sometimes I overlook the value of non-formal education, especially in developing countries, seems like a great way to provide information and give people what they want - the chance to learn, better themselves, grow - in any way they can."""

"I think that education of girls  is the base of the humanity's development. If women  have education they can make progress in many different areas. It is very important to educate women  in order to accomplish the main society's goals, it is beneficial for everyone. I also think it is very important to stress that education of girl is their basic human right. Girls have right to education, it is justice. Together we must spread this idea."
"If we only  superficially read all the Millennium Development Goals, we also may superficially conclude that only some of the MDG is  related to the education of girls. The point is, in my opinion that all the goals is related to this extremly important topic. "
One of the issues here is that it is easy to get exactly the right answer for 5.R.R3 using completely the wrong approach (which then puts you on the back foot for 5.R.R4) -- thanks for the jolt back to reality.

I'm coming at this course from the perspective of pregnancy and birth. I have a deep interest in birth as a humanist issue and the vitality of addressing the topics it faces. I'm enjoying broadening my geographical horizons in this field and the scope of challenges women face through almost every aspect of their lives. The first chapter has laid a solid foundation for the subjects up for investigation and how they are globally  interwoven.
Many students have discovered that the poly() and I() methods will give different results.  I don't think that the question is ambiguous.
"I thought this was a fantastic discussion. Really lively, informative and uplifting in terms of the work that is being carried out already. I was very pleased to listen to this and it further strengthened my understanding and pursuit of women's rights as human rights."
"I found this video fascinating and it provided an explanation for me about a question I have wondered about as a U.S. citizen. At times, there appears to be a strong reflex against larger government efforts, despite the fact that it may benefit the majority of the citizenry - whether we're talking about universal medical care (and Australia is a great example of this, so I'm glad Helen described it!), environmental measures, etc.  There appears to be a deep affinity toward keeping government out, even when it may benefit the majority of the people. Helen's explanation of the legal divide/schism created by the Cold War and the U.S.'s resultant leaning toward negative laws really make sense to me as a contributory explanation of this phenomenon."

"I think I now understand what happened to my cousin a few years ago while scuba diving with a group.   They were learning how to dive and so were somehow tethered at the bottom of the water as well as the top for safety.   When he was near the bottom, his tether line broke and he was catapulted to the surface.   As he reached the surface he was in full cardiac arrest.   His cardiovascular system was probably compromised by the larger bubbles being released at too fast a pace??  He was 60 at the time and did survive."
"I also enjoyed the Stress module the most.  In second place, I think I go for hot and cold modules.  But I think all of them were great!!  I`m really sad this adventure is over!!"

"Also, I should clarify my interest in AIC has been spurred by the need to select among parametric survival models (e.g. exponential, Weibull, generalized gamma, etc.) in my own work. I've been implicitly relying on AIC but wonder if so doing is overly dogmatic."
"Your comment got deep into my heart.  I felt shocked, anger and an immense sadness about how the devaluation of girls ends in their tragic dismiss.  Girls are 'bad investments' and not reliable for future earnings are harsh concepts.  The trash image cut into my soul...how could this happen? "
"I second your thought regarding ideology and I may add how it shapes women's lives.  Negative rights are enforced more by the USA in countries where there are protracted conflicts, this fact seems to me that is convenient to its constitution not to the victims of conflicts.  It is really stupid to think that positive rights are of an ideology of the cold war, thus the reason not to sign.  "

"Finding ways to prevent, reduce, or treat spinal injuries caused by long-term exposure to variable g-forces is one of the interesting research avenues aerospace physiologists are currently focused on. There is at least one on-going study regarding neck and back pain in Naval Aviators. While it's true that the helmets have gotten somewhat lighter over the years, other technological changes (such as helmet-mounted sighting and cuing, night-vision goggles, and enhanced communication devices) have made helmets in excess of 10 pounds relatively common. Even when the aircrew aren't routinely exposed to high g-forces (such as helicopter pilots), each flight may subject the crew to 5+ hours of moderate to extreme vibration, which can also cause some unintended neurological side-effects."
"Generally speaking, because they are going from low pressure to high pressure, concerns about decompression sickness aren't a factor."
"Perhaps a sideways benefit to finishing a warm shower with a minute or so long cold water blast is that one has opened the pores of the skin, and the cold closes them, maybe sealing in the warmth. Of course if nothing else, one has saved a bit on not heating the water, which generally will make a heating bill less, so saving money for the day can make one feel happier all day. And it helps defog the mirror when you step out of your bath or shower. All sorts of side benefits."

Hi
"This is a tricky question to answer in particular concerning the varying social and political contexts of the affected populations. Each intervention must be tailored to the communities' needs and resources.  In many cases, HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment will be similar: such as HIV/AIDS education programs tailored for truck drivers and male frequenters of pool halls. However, there are cultural differences; for instance, while in Honduras men offer their women as service to other men on trips from the mountains to urban areas to sell produce, girls in Africa self-prostitute for cell phones or primary education. In some cases education is what is most needed but illiteracy must be adapted to.In most cases, as mentioned, women are educated on the topic so structures of violence must be combatted."
I think the lack of oxygen might have altered the shape of the cornea.
"Interestingly, the agency I am working for right now also starts using info-graphics to present complicated info. we all know that lots of reports/papers are produced every year but seldom does general public read them. why? coz not everyone is interested in reading 100 something reports... so we need to be innovative in terms of outreach efforts to influence more people on important issues such as women's rights."
"I disagree a little bit. I enjoyed the aging section the most. It made me think about how to prepare for that part of my life. Something that I had never done before. Of course, this is a great course and I have enjoyed all sections a lot."
"I practiced yoga for a couple of years in my late 20's, and really liked it. Unfortunately, I stopped when I moved and couldn't find a good teacher/class that I liked and could afford in my new location. In my 50's, I started tai-chi, and it's what I do now on a daily basis. I usually feel that my stress levels go down after a tai-chi session, while also feeling like I have more energy to do whatever I need in my daily life. I highly recommend tai-chi for people of any age, and I could go on and on about all the health benefits (everything Natalie11 mentions and more)."
"Hello all.....i too have joined the course late. But am excited to see the range of topics being covered. Issues like women's mental health and older women's rights are rarely discussed- even within the development sector, where i work. So am looking forward to an enriching course experience!"
"Here's my hypothesis. Older people have slower digestion. So if they've had food before the exercise, the movement of the food in their intestines due to the exercise causes the nausea. As a figure skater in my forties, I find that when I do spins after having food an hour or so earlier, I feel nausea. When I was younger, I didn't get this."

"I think this question is difficult to answer without knowing the context of the location in which the social/non-medical interventions are to be carried out. The factor of culture is incredibly significant when enacting interventions and must be bottom up. This week I have been programming consultative stakeholder meetings in Lesotho of the major parents, educators, youth leaders, church leaders, and ministers/chiefs. These meetings began as a way to create a policy of open dialogue surrounding sexual and reproductive health issues predominately HIV/AIDS as there are many obstacles in the way between open communication between all of these groups. The main being culture and the taboos surrounding sexual health discussions."
"Yes, basically the CV criterion will penalise overfitted models that could (erroneously) be found by the best subset selection and help avoid them."

Gene Richardson's talks were really interesting and valuable. I was previously aware of social interventions but had not heard them described in such an articualted way. So this was really valuable.
"I found particularly interesting in the report Women and Health is the reference to women suicide rating in the world. As we know, women' health is very vulnerable and there are many diseases related many times to pregancy, sexual illnesses, cancers. However, it is important to take into consideration that \suicide is among the leading causes of death for women between the ages of 20 and 59 "
"Nutrition is critical! If you have been on a western diet most of your life, which your knee replacement suggests, you have been on a high inflammation diet which can cause lots of problems in addition to arthritis.

"I thoroughly enjoyed this interview and the timeline that was discussed in relation to the development of human rights treaties, etc.  I think, on a superficial level, it is east to point a finger at other countries who do not follow through with what they have signed off on.  I personally never considered the lack of funds or manpower as a deterrent to these factors.  I also am disgruntled by the fact behind the US lack of support for CEDAW.  But, I have gained a better perspective as to why (sovereignty).  I am looking forward to more guest speakers, and hopefully from Helen Stacy."

1. The linkage between a woman being married and the likelihood of her being infected with HIV/AIDS is particularly high. This was seen in few of the states in India from where out-migration is high. The Ante-natal records of these states showed an increase in HIV positivity. The spouses of male migrants were till then not seen as a risk group. However further studies showed a co-relation between male migration and increase in HIV positivity in spouses. The two main factors being low exposure to HIV awareness programs or communication programs  for women in rural areas and weak linkages to health services especially HIV related services. Stigma and a culture of silence around sexual relations and a skewed sexual relationship power adds to this vulnerability.

"I think a key intervention area, as with many issues we deal with, is education. This could perhaps be the most effective means of prevention as it includes most other forms. This could be both in formal and non-formal settings. Introducing sexual and reproductive health education in school curricula around the world means school-going kids are exposed to information on HIV/AIDS from a very early age.By the time they hit puberty and become sexually active, they would have been equipped with enough knowledge to encourage the practice of safe sex or preferably, delaying of sexual experience. Informal education could take the form of sensitization and outreach programs in the various communities, especially those where literacy rates are very low, taking into consideration the gender gaps too.While reading the material for this week, I realised that there has been a reduction in the number of outreach programs geared on HIV/AIDS sensitisation as compared to the 90s when I was growing up and was an active child activist in this area.I think these programs need to be revived because despite the success stories, new infections are still being registered and people seem to be a little less informed about HIV/AIDS. "

"I think all goals are dependent on girls receiving a relevant and good quality education, tailored for their own circumstances, for their fulfillment. However, educating girls is explicitly targeted in goal 2 \Achieve universal primary education\"", since \""universal\"" includes girls, obviously. Goal 3 also refers to girls' education explicitly in its description (Promote gender equality and empower women: Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015). In this respect, it catches my attention that education is the only mean of equality which is explicitly referred to in this goal's description, since many of the opportunities that education provides girls with are often decimated by labor inequality. "

So far all modules have had some gold. The stress module discussing HRV was very relevant as I have been tracking my HRV over the last 2.5 months.

I will continue to implement that into my daily practice.

"Good question.  I guess there is huge individual variation at play in this.  Just like 'pain' threshold, I am sure we all have different 'stress' thresholds.  I remember a study of US soldiers in either Korean or Vietnam (can not remember which), found that they could cope with extreme amounts of pain because they knew they had survived and were getting out of the front line, while similar injuries back in the US required much more in the way of strong opiate pain control.  As Cory pointed out - we live with a certain amount of stress each day, and we all actively seek certain stressful situations for pleasure.  To some people, not being under stress, may be the ultimate stress.  <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
I completely agree with you about gender equality being absolutely essential. But I think that gender equality will be a long slog and that it can be a result of these interventions/solutions and not a prerequisite. Tiny steps...tiny steps will get us there. I am actually very inspired by all the research that is being carried out on gender inequality and the devastation it results in. The horror I feel at reading the stories of these women is followed by a profound sense of hope because people are working to understand it...and from there change can happen.
You are absolutely right! Thanks for pointing those out. They have been fixed.

"It seems strange to think I am here enjoying this course learning about Women rights from my laptop screen and from the comfort of my home when so many girls are deprived of even the most basic of education. Moreover, I have a substantial amount of freedom to chose what I learn and to learn counter arguments and to think analytically to arrive at my own conclusions. My fear is that if education is free to all through state apparatus then who, aside from the state, will be accountable for shaping the values narrated in curriculum. What if girls are encouraged to attend school and to learn but what they are learning is politicised, or reinforces some idea that they are second class citizens? Children shouldn't just have a right to be educated. Children should have the right to be educated in such a way that they can learn to think and to have the freedom."

I feel really blessed that in the society i leave in most parents would give anything for their children to pursue further studies, making no disciminations whether their offspings are boys or girls."

Coming from a firm pre-medical background, I must say that I am truly impressed with amount of knowledge I received.

Aging and Stress were my favorite. I will gladly pass this course down to a couple of my colleagues. "

I've just started reading *[Why We Get Fat][1]* by Gary Taubes, and the first part is all about how many of the assumptions we currently hold about diet are not well-supported by research. It is good to see a group of scientists (as mentioned in the TED talk) working toward an unbiased understanding of what IS supported by research in this complex and very important field.

Question already been titled.
"This lecture was particularly interesting because as a sprint event swimmer myself and now as a coach I found that I swam far faster in a finals event (in the evening) than in the prelims (typically in the morning). Physiologically this makes sense because my core temperature was warmer in the evenings, sending warm blood to my warmer muscles to sprint faster. I have a swimmer that I coach who has a similar issue but it often is a problem in that she misses qualifying for finals in her prelims competition because she can't swim fast enough in the morning. She probably has an harder time than others getting warm muscles in the morning. As a coach this helps because my goal is to find a way to help her warm her muscles to swim faster in the morning. Awesome lecture!"

"It is really sad that in some places women's condition is so poor. and the main cause seems to be the lack of respect for women in boys or men. it is painfull to even think that someone has to go through so much mental and physical torture, tension and worries and has to face economic crisis but the worst thing is they are being hurted by the one's (husbands) who were supposed to protect them. i really salute them for how strong they are. but more painful is that i know what they are going through but i don't have a sngle idea how can i help them. i think the best way to support them is to educate them , to make them self dependent and to teach boys to respect girls and women."
"The Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) that relate directly to girls' education are goal 2 (Achieve universal primary education) and goal 3 (promote gender equality and empower women). Goal 3 relates directly to education as it seeks to promote gender equality through eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education. As we learnt in the week's readings, the challenge of education in the MDGs rests on the quality of each student's learning. Getting kids into school is not the end of the struggle."

"My mother was a midwife. She could not read or write.  She was Mexican and had a very hard life. Having to raise her younger siblings and care for the home, while her parents worked the fields, her knowledge of the circle of life grew. Watching the  farm animals give birth naturally, that is how  she based her assistane in  birthing mothers as she became an adult. Birthing a child  is  a natural part of life. She provided herbs at the proper time, comfortabed the mom as labor progressed. It was a time of poverty, after the depression and World war II, and there wasn't  a Blue Cross network or after hrs clinics. It was all quite normal to have  babies at home. Of all the babies she assisted, only once was there a  problem where a doctor had to be called in as an emergency situaion arose. It wasn't all bad~~~~~~~~~~~~~~just sayin'. I had midwives with my children, but it is difficult to locate GOOD midwives and even drs. due to  law suits, which  is a whole different topic............and  a bit sad."

I noticed a dramatic decrease in my sweating when I first arrived, even during intense exercise. Over 2 years, this has changed and I now sweat more that I used to when I first moved. I think it is a combination of genetics (relating to functioning of sweat glands) combined with adaptations - both long and short term - to novel environments.

"I was just thinking the other day about how women tend to mostly mentioned in relation to someone and never just by their names. This is particularly the case in Africa where I grew up half of my life. There, you find that women introduce themselves as such-and-such'es wife, and when have children they are forever known as so-an-so's mother [usually known as the mother of (insert name of first born child) even though she likely has several other kids]. When I moved to the US in my early teens, I found it rather different that women go by their first name no matter their age. I even had a very awkward exchange with my boss when I called her Mrs.xyz and she insisted that I call her by her first name. Growing up I was taught that calling grown ups by their name shows lack of respect, and while that may or may not be true, I have come to the conclusion that women slowly lose their identity when they are constantly referred in relation to the fathers, boyfriends, husbands or the kids they bear. It is as if women were blank slates without ambitions of their own beforehand. Small things like that subtly perpetuate the status quo."

"I'm running behind in the course and did the Stress portion on Saturday. In what is an extremely strange coincidence, I was scheduled on Sunday to do an entire day of yoga and meditation as part of a stress reduction clinic I'm in at one of the local Toronto hospitals (based on Jon-Kabat Zinn's work in Boston). So, it was fascinating to get a new perspective before doing the day long retreat. I've been doing restorative yoga for the past few months to combat an overwhelmed stress response (mostly due to some bad personal events that pushed me too hard along with a stressful occupation) which led to insomnia, anxiety problems, depression. The list seems to go on and on but all the problems seem to be very inter-related. From a personal standpoint, what I've found with meditation is that it's brought a clarity to what the issues are and has allowed me at times to begin to face the stress better (the course I'm in calls it responding rather than reacting)."

"A fit with cubic splines may have many more degrees of freedom than one with a polynomial if the number of knots is high, that is #1 wrong."

"I found the information on FGM distressing. I have been in a working environment in the past where this information was introduced, but didn't realize the extent of the practice, nor did I realize it was women who were engaged in this practice due to cultural norms.  I had been informed that this was primarily a tool that men used to keep women \docile\"", and now better understand how pervasive FGM is for many countries. "

"This used to happen in my country, but now I dare to say it is not so common. The question is the following: by custom the father's last name always comes before the mother's, therefore, man is the one that gives continuity to the \family's last name\"", so they are preferred. Though the legislation have changed and introduced the mode of that any of the last names can go first, always the father's last name is preferred."

"Even though I took several women's rights courses, none of the books I had previously read quite captured why women's rights should be given special attention as opposed to taking a universal human rights approach. The first chapter really brought home to me the battle women face and how apt the phrase being born female is a health hazard. I look forward to reading the rest of the book."
"\But the one who knows That there¡¯s nothing to seek Knows too that there¡¯s nothing to say. She keeps her mouth closed.\"" I believe, educating women about their rights as a woman and as a human being helps alleviate abuse and violence.I feel bad for those girls who had to trade sex for a pad, I could feel the pain of those women, who were being beaten because they refused to have sex with their husbands. A woman's right has been violated right at her very own home in the hands of her own family. I was there for almost eight years. I was young. I knew nothing about my rights.I chose this course not only to educate myself but because I have two young daughters to educate too."""
"Education is proven to be the best way to prevent HIV/AIDS. From education there are all the benefits to staying at school longer, and girls delaying their sexual life, marrying later, being able to join the workforce and make some income for herself and family.This is a long term goal with results seen in years to come. By being educated girls then become more empowered to negotiate around sexual encounters.Education of HIV/AIDS also will help them to understand the disease and take steps to prevent it, or to seek treatment.Boys education will teach them that women are not the transmitters of HIV?AIDS and they can prevent its spread by using condoms.Education to safe drug use also. Education is huge in prevention."

"I think in an advanced course I would really like to see some more theory -not exclusively theory- but some more depth. For example, I have no idea why repeating examples in a training set when using Bootstrap is beneficial at all.. I would have liked some more discussion of that."
"Another thing to mindful of is the different sub-fields within statistics. I was trained as an econometrician, where we take into account economic significance. In econometrics, we are more concerned with pre-defined models based on economic theory, so we don't add or drop variables to make the model \fit better\"". In some econometric papers, they are ecstatic with an R^2 of <0.2.  "
Coordinate gradient descent is the optimization method.  
"Reliance on the biomedical model undermines the introduction of social interventions by fostering the assumption that non-medical interventions are inherently inferior and less effective than medical solutions.  Non-medical interventions to epidemics like HIV/AIDS, however, can not only be effective, but have the potential, in a way that medical interventions do not, of creating long-term structural change that may prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS as well as numerous other diseases.  Beyond disease prevention, the lasting implications of social interventions for human rights and quality of life are far reaching.  "
"Given that HIV infection in women and girls is so intrinsically linked with gender equality, it could be argued that any intervention to improve gender equality would contribute to the prevention of this deadly virus. Further, in terms of social or non-medical interventions for the prevention or treatment of HIV, it is very important to ensure that women living with HIV are meaningfully involved in these approaches."
"agreed. Although, there is a good thread going on for this question."

"All eight of the millennium development goals are linked to girls¡¯ education on some level.  Goals 2 and 3 are explicitly so, in that they seek to address universal access to primary education and the elimination of gender disparities in education.  Goals 4, 5, and 6 are closely linked to girls¡¯ education as a pathway for empowering girls to understand and exercise autonomy over their sexual and reproductive health.  A girl¡¯s level of education directly impacts the likelihood that she will survive her pregnancies and births as she is more likely to delay sexual activity, pregnancy, and marriage, and to seek appropriate care when birthing, etc.  As this unit¡¯s infographic showed, children whose mothers were educated are 50% more likely live past the age of five.  Similarly, educated girls and women are more likely to take measures to protect themselves and their families from HIV and other STIs and diseases (goal 6).  Our readings also highlighted the economic and environmental impact of educating girls, which addresses goals 1 and 7.  And finally, the inclusion of women in the global partnership for development referenced in goal 8 will only enhance effectiveness, creativity, and change.  This must happen by educating and equipping girls to become global leaders.  "
I think in the same way.
"Two social/non-medical interventions that might be effective in preventing or treating HIV/AIDS are: Education, and Financial Aid through the use of microfinancing.  "
"Shane! Would love to help you on your way to get a statement with distinction :) I have a guess about what is going on... Is where the bar would be replaced with a little black 'x'? The lowest 4 scores for CFU are dropped, which means only the top 30 of the 34 CFU's count for your grade. This is to help boost the scores! If you have already completed over 30 of the CFU's this may be why that is happening. "

"The age factor might also have to do with how we perceive things. Children are very in the moment and have a direct perception.

Thanks. I think I made this question be too complicated.
"Their relationship with men is the primary problem. Thinking about it too much because of the things they feel powerless over causes headaches, sleep problems and unhappy or sad feelings... All understandable. Their lack of control over the conditions of their lives causes them alot of stress both mentally and physically. The women are expected to do everything to provide for their families, and the are not treated fairly for jobs, or land or credit access. They endure tremendous mental, physical and verbal abuse from their husband which makes them all the more uncertain and insecure about the relationship. Even though they do so much for themselves to support their families, they don't have any control over most aspects of their lives. The selfish men in these women's lives have really taken advantage of the women, whe only trying their best for their families. The harder they try to be responsible for the work, and budget and household responsibilities the more abusive their partners seem to be. This is a vicious cycle that has to stop! I feel so sorry for these women, who try so hard and then are mentally, verbally and physically abused or just ignored. No wonder they have so many illnesses because of all their worrying. I could understand why they are so ambivalent about marriage...I would be! Where is the big bonus for these women? It sounds like they have a piece of paper, saying they are married (because they are expected to),but they might as well stay single...at least they may struggle but there would be no abuse for them to endure. I hope one day these women can get more independence from their husbands rein, as well be a voice for future generations to try and bring the love and respect they deserve, so their daughters will not have to go through this and their sons will learn to love,honor and respect the women/mothers of their life. Without mothers none of these men would be here...yet they don't seem to care!"

"The numbers on the extend of the spread of violence against women are certainly worrying. The report states low levels of education as one of the major factors to do violence against women or to become a victim of gender based violence. However, I would like to add that domestic violence can occurs regardless of the level of education. In fact, many cases have been reported of educated women suffering violence and educated men excising physical,sexual and psychological abuse against their partner. Outlining the risks groups is important, but we have make clear that nobody is immune to domestic violence regardless of the educational, social or cultural background. Psychological violence is lot more difficult to identify yet, it has devastating consequences on the mental and physical (psycho-somatic responses)health of its victims. Due to the patriarchal ideas of romantic love many times, some women mistake and confuse extreme jealousy and control with love and care and therefore fail to identify abuse."

"From Fear to Freedom was a great video and one of my favorite parts of this course.

It made me feel connected in sisterhood with all these women and I wished I could march with them. It was particularly refreshing to see the outreach to men and their willingness to advocate for women, their wives, sisters, mothers, daughters. Together we can turn the tide!"

Not an expert in physiology so if anyone has the answer, fantastic. The idea of trapped fluid makes sense to me. Thanks"

I have lived in the USA, Hong Kong and now am back in my homeland after 30 years. Women's issues have always been of great interest to me. I am currently involved in an advisory role for an NGO that empowers the poor in my country. I could not stop reading Professor Murray's book. Looking forward to learning from all of you."
"I find the inclusion in the reading of so many statistics is, for me, distracting and detrimental to the point of the chapter. I understand the need to illustrate with hard data the issues but pages and pages of numbers and percentages are impossible to fully absorb. I would suggest using more tables or charts that could be referenced as needed with trends and major information highlighted in the narrative."
"I think that definitely the 8 goals have to do with the education of girls. But to be more specific, goals 2 \Achieve universal primary education\"" and 3 \""Promote gender equality and empower women\"" are relate directly to the subject and the others: 1 \""Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger\"", 4 \""Reduce child mortality\"", 5 \""Improve maternal health\"", 6 \""Combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases\"", 7 \""Ensure environmental sustainability\"", and 8 \""Develop further an open, rule-based,predictable, non discriminatory trading and financial system\"" have a dependency relationship. These are the direct consequence, the benefits that brings educating a girl."

"I really appreciated Helen Stacy's point that she is a long term optimist. This is something that resonates deeply in my own experience. Having spent two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in West Africa, I was aware that the predominant view of Africa among my friends and family was of stagnation, victimization, and ignorance. What I always tried to explain is that such unilateral appraisals disguise much of the immense evolution that is occurring there (I use 'evolution' simply to describe change, not necessarily progression). Among other things, Within 3 generations of people many villages have moved beyond a pre-industrial lifestyle with significantly rigid gender norms, to (in my village) emphasizing the education of girls, and the ubiquitous use of cell phones throughout. If one can imagine just how long it took women to get the vote in the US, even after the industrialization of our country, the near blitz of cultural and infrastructure change occurring in many countries is very hopeful. Of course there are always reversals, but the trend seems to point in a hopeful direction."

"While the information contained in these posts wasn't new to me, it is wonderful to be reminded of such a powerful mechanism for change like education. It reminds me of how often in health, we choose to go for the biomedical model instead of recognizing most of the improvements in health have occurred due to public health interventions. A pill is very seductive, but a latrine is the gift that keeps on giving! Likewise, education is one of those practices that permits societal change and empowers individuals with the means of self-determination, ostensibly."

"I think that the notion that human rights in Rwanda have improved is a bit of a misnomer. Sure there is a difference with the time of the genocide but there are still daily human rights violations going on particularly with issues of freedom of association and freedom of expression. Dissenters are well known to be thrown in prisono or have to live the country for fear for their lives. Rwanda indeed has a very high percentage of women in the parliament but i don't think that this has necessarily led to better decision making, particularly with Rwanda's interventions in neighbouring countries."

"The activity related to signature of CEDAW and its coming into force has been very enlightening: thank you for suggesting it. As an Italian, I am very pleased with the fact that the government of Italy has signed and has made only a procedural exception. I am also very pleased to see that it considers it its role to review other state parties exceptions. However, in a recent survey on living conditions for women in Europe Italy has scored very poorly as one of the worst countries for a  woman to be living in, in the European Union. The incidence of domestic violence is definately on the increase and the institutional response is poor and unable to link police, health, education, justice and economic responses to this problem, which is treated in silos. in short, i believe that a lot still needs to be done and even if the intentions are honourable, equality for women is hardly a priority issue in practice."

"The human rights lens in not only helping on health issues, but aiding to improve the living conditions of different people.

Men should be an important part in the learning process they should be part of women's organisations that deal with these issues..

"Most people don't focus about the importance of the prevention by information. Could be taught by churches, social movements, or in the school. Teach the girls how to take care of themselves will change their mind and teach them their rights that should be protected. It is important to teach about it to females, but also males should be received some education so social conservatives thoughts can be developed."
Yes I do agree. Culture plays a major role in this.
"Reading Avotri and Walters, ¡°We Women Worry a Lot about our Husbands¡±, something really hit me; in some parts of the globe, women's worth is defined according their childbearing ability. Now hw about women who are biologically simply unable to conceive or bear a baby? Does it mean she is somewhat worthless?! I personally know women who are unable to conceive, no matter how hard they try yet bear family and partner support and it just makes me really sad to know that in other parts of the world such women may be considered unworthy for that."

"I think the essence of what 'human rights' really means may be perfectly understood by Eleanor Roosevelt's few simple words: \equal jutice, equal ooportunity and equal dignity without discrimination\"". Doesn't sound much but to me it says more than several exhaustive lists I have been reviewing so far."""
"I deeply agree with Akila that without full gender equality, there is no possible prevalence of the rule of law, thereby real democracy. I equally deem it essential to understand and communicate better that domestic violence is not a private issue any more, it is not something a woman should feel ashamed about, as in numerous partiarchal societies these days women are forced to feel that way and keep these awful experiences to themselves. We have to act and talk and talk more about it."
"If that works as a stress control mechanism for the person then it would work.....however, it very much depends on the situation and the relationship between the stressed individual and the 'hugger', for example, it may help with a child or partner but would be totally inappropriate in a customer/client situation and may well cause even more stress."
"Unfortunately I have to agree with Helen when she says that human rights today are rather an idea, considering that for many, and by that I mean for a great part of the world, social justice, access to education, bodily integrity are just not realistic. This is the responsibility of the developed countries to make it happen for them, this is our responsibility."

"yes, as in the residuals are studentized --- ~ Student's t. But IMHO either 2 or 3 would be cause for further investigation."
It seems that a lot of use agree that at this point human rights is an idea that is still not always accepted. How would you say that we go about putting action into that idea across not only the country we live in but the world? Is it just speaking on what human rights are? How can we impact a place we do not live in or understand their culture?

"I too was troubled by the percentages of women who condone wife-beating. One possible reason for this is that whenever a particular population or group is abused or oppressed, there are those members of the group who will begin to identify with their oppressor and agree with their abusive behavior. Perhaps this is a somewhat subconscious attempt to curry favor with the abusers in hopes of avoiding the abuse themselves? A second possible reason is religious indoctrination. The very conservative/fundamentalist branches of many religions emphasize the subservience of women in the public and private sphere, and the women may feel that to be a good (Muslim, Christian, etc.), they must accept and espouse these anti-female doctrines."
What version of IE are you using?  I have not had any problems seeing these formulas (it take a few moments before the formulas appear) when using IE 10 or IE 11.

"I find it interesting that we continue to be biased on parties and not on the rights of women in United States.  It is amazing to me that we are the only country that has not signed. It really does not speak well for us.  The rights of family, the willingness to allow the husband to provide, and the wife to stay at home and raise the children.  "
"Wow, Susan, I totally understand your situation. May daughter is in a similar situation and it is heartbreaking to see it going on and on. She has spent (and I have given her) thousands of dollars for lawyers to try to fight for her kids because he has the advantage due to his position, power and connections. Of course women from disadvantaged economic situations have terrible situations, but it is such a mistake for people to think that middle class or more economically advantaged, educated women do not experience similar levels of misery, terror and disenpowerment in the face of the system that is supposed to be protecting them. The manipulation, lies and deceit that occur, even within the 'justice' system, is unreal. In addition to watching this nightmare that my daughter has gone through and continues to deal with, I had a patient who was married to a law enforcement officer who broke her arm while she was pregnant. Let me have you guess who ended up with custody of the kids and who ended up spending thousands to try to get them back. I can't agree more with your last statement about a complicit legal system."

"This interview truly opened my eyes to the paramount importance of women's rights. I definitely agree with Akila - many do not realise that a woman is also a human being. It is awefully shameful that women are not seen to deserve what every human being is entitled to. I am very pleased to hear that the Global Justice Centre works to shape the treatment of women through a Human Right's perspective, because the inhumane behaviour towards our women should not be treated as a mere case of m¨¦nage misunderstanding. Essentially, this world is dependent on the women in it, and it's about time people realise that."

Sometimes he even goes to the bathroom with her. She won't speak up in front of him but can't tell him to leave. The situation is clear but there is no opportunity to address the woman alone. I remember well a case like this of a 'mail order bride' who was clearly being victimized. I felt like I failed because I never, during the entire pregnancy, was able to get one private word with her. I later found out that she had escaped and was going through legal channels to be able to keep her child and I was able to help at that time with documentation of my observations. But I wonder what hell that woman's life was and if there was something else I could have done. Even if the man is not in the room, often it is so difficult. I live in an area with very few resources. What can I recommend that she do? What options does she really have? I really appreciated the ideas in this article on different ways to bring up the subject without being totally direct, placing the power of the decision whether to divulge the violence at the discretion of the woman, rather than her having to get defensive. I liked these ideas so much that I am going to bring this to the office with me. I would like to also say that even though girls and women who have lived with abuse are statistically more likely to end up in these relationships (at least in the U.S.), that is not the only risk factor. When my daughter was having a low moment in her life she fell into a relationship with a man who was controlling and psychologically abusive. There was a constant thread in my mind saying 'I never thought this could happen to one of my daughters because they were raised in a home without violence and I bought into the myth that it only happened to other people. It can happen to anyone."

"Good morning, Anne. I read this week's courseware (Week 6) and one of the requirements for the course is to interact with a group of peers to discuss the course. Upon reading the requirements for the group discussion, I'm a bit confused as to which group we should be interacting with. I did search for teammates using the Piazza Forum and was happy to receive 5 responses from classmates all over the world. Although I did state that I'm from San Diego, no one from the students in the course seems to live in my area. Would my group of 5 women be acceptable as my group of peers? We've already been discussing issues this past week and I like how we all get to share different views based on our cultures and upbringing. I'd like some clarification, please, because the discussion toolkit is offering the chance to connect with online groups. Is this something different other than the group I already belong to?"
"The idea (reality) that male children are preferred in nearly every country seems jarring to the ear, but I think a very important step in understanding the world we live in and have been socialized in is to first realize that there is inequality and preferences on lines of gender (and race/sexuality/gender identity/size/ability/etc.) work only as products of this inequality and as reinforcement to this injustice. Preference does not exist in a vacuum, especially not for those families who cannot afford to have a girl within a cultural system that treat women as an expense or threat. "

"The problem is in what you both have just said - men should not simply 'get away' with these horrid acts. The ignorance has reached such a level, that people are beginning to accept these acts as part of the social norm. A question I've always had is, why are only the women and children educated about their rights as a human being? Why aren't the perpetrators punished, pulled aside and given a dose of their own medicine? I once read that the world now focuses on telling women to be careful not to get raped, instead of telling men to NOT RAPE. Is this really what our society has come to? More courses like these should be implemented to raise awareness of this stark reality and how we must not delay in bringing about change."

"While I agree that trees are relatively easy to interpret and explain, they don't do very well for understanding relationships between a single predictor and the target.  With a linear model, one can simply use the coefficient (or a transformation for something like a logistic model) to understand the result from such a change.  For a tree, a positive change in a predictor might result in a positive change in the dependent variable down one branch, but have the opposite relationship in a different branch."

"Education is internationally acknowledged to benefit individuals and promote national development. It is widely recognized as the gateway to economic security and opportunity. Education and training remain important elements to any effort to eliminate gender inequality. If this sounds right, the critical question becomes: whether expanding educational and training opportunity for women is enough to eliminate the gender inequalities which continue to characterize our society? Can development efforts succeed with the persistence of gender inequalities? There is a need for clear and efficient policies that watch over the avoidance of all forms of gender inequalities. It is crucial to have a clear vision and objective for all the policies concerned with the establishment of gender equality. The education for all goals represents an international and national commitment to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005 and to achieve gender parity throughout education 10 years later. However, education does not have the same benefit for males and females. The obstacles created by policies to female access to education are meant a loss of the opportunity for many women to break through the gender inequality arising from the prevalence of a gender_biased tradition. Furthermore, literacy and education are important determinants of economic growth and women¡¯s education may be especially important for long_term growth. The current growing interest and increasing concern in the gender equality issues in the literature is consistent with the increasing commitment towards fulfilling MDG 2&3 by 2015."

"I was very affected by the reading from Paul Farmer's book and then the discussion of structural violence in the video with Gene Richardson. I had not come across this concept of structural violence before, at least not presented in this manner, and it makes a lot of sense to me now. All along it has been clear that the conditions we have been discussing in various classes are caused by an underlying structural negative bias towards the weak and most vulnerable in our society . Be it in the developed world, Darlene's example in Harlem, or someone in Asia or Africa. The issues of racism, sexism and poverty exacerbates and exposes these weakest segments of society to epidemics like AIDS. And even amongst the weakest there is a hierarchy and women occupy the last rung on the ladder therefore they are the most unfortunate and most vulnerable. "

"The interview with Akila Radhakrishnan was very enlightening as she described in a very clear way how women health and human rights are intertwined.

"Although the importance of understanding women's education as a human rights issue and not merely an aspect of development, statistics like '2/3 illiterate adults are women' and 'a child whose mother is literate is 50% more likely to live past five' really are very useful when making a case for the importance of women's literacy education. Regardless of personal beliefs, these are facts that are difficult to argue."

"Although only a handful of the Millennium Goals pertain specifically to girls and women (two, three, and five), many more are dependent on educating girls in order to achieve fulfilment. In order to achieve goal 1, it is necessary to include girls within the education system so that they and their future families can be benefited by the economic and social returns of their education (higher employment, greater household income, higher social positioning). Goals 4 and 6 depend upon girls being educated about their own sexual and reproductive health, in order to successfully avoid contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies. This is equally essential for goal 5, which requires that women have access to knowledge about family planning and contraception, and about their own bodies, in order to avoid maternal complications (especially those which come about as a result of a mother being too old or too young, or having had too many children, or too little time for her body to recover between pregnancies."

Indeed providing education is not enough if it is not quality education that provides entry into the labour market and improves civic participation in politics.  In addition to a strong advocacy towards improving the quality of education we should perhaps respond in a more efficient way to the changing societies due to the high migration flows, conflicts and ethnic changes of the population ratio."

"Every day I see amazing feats accomplished by my athletic friends who are 20-30 years older than I am. It is so true that older athletes really excel at endurance races and events. As we age, we lose our speed that we used to have during our prime years, but that void is then filled with the experiences we've been through, and the mental challenges we've had to overcome. Why are the world's top endurance athletes older? The answer is experience, both mental and physical. It's not easy for a 20 year-old to train for a 100-mile running race (such as Western States 100 or Badwater) and expect to do well. Given his age, he probably doesn't have years of experience under his belt and miles of road under his feet. It can take a toll on his body if he is not accustomed to that load for that extended period of time. But what I've found to be the most important factor in completing one of these endurance events is the athlete's mental endurance. Having a strong mentality capable of enduring such long, grueling distances truly only comes with age and experience."

"There is also an additional question. There is no question that literacy and education is an imperative, particularly for girls but also boys. It is the foundation, yet not the sole issue, for receiving sufficient information to make informed decisions on life¡¯s crucial choices, such as reproduction. And the corollary to education is generating openings for economic activities, either formal or informal. Otherwise a perverse outcome can be that a young woman (or man) can receive enough education to aspire not to live their parent¡¯s lifestyle, but they have no opportunity to move on, raising the prospect that they become unemployed urban slum dwellers. Which raises a very challenging question: if potential for employment to match education standard does not exist, but the avenue to continue family substance type living remains, to what level should a person be educated?"
"Personally I watch the videos, read the book and only then do the quizzes. In a couple occasions I noticed that lectures weren't sufficient to answer quizzes, so I decided to read the book before attempting answers. Also, reading the book is great to fix the key points in my mind. I never read the pdfs, since I watched the videos already. If I have any spare time, I prefer to study the book or navigate the forum. Doing the book exercises would be a great idea, but I've got a full-time job and I I'd never find time for that. "
"Girls education is a right that should be promoted by all countries.When you educate a girl, you educate the future generation.Girls have a bigger role they play in the development of the countries.In Africa and Uganda specifically,a girl child is faced with a lot of challenges to access quality education.These mainly include the gender stereotyping about girls, the roles and responsibilities given to girls,long traveling distances to school and poverty that inhibits them to attain a level of education.The global concern about the girl child education is a response to education for all. Girls need to be supported to facilitate them complete their education.Lack of literacy and numeracy skills by girls is a root cause for gender based violence and other forms of abuses."
"When viewing the lecture (and reading the book), it would be nice to run the examples of the illustrations in R. Yes, we have the Credit dataset. Yes, we can easily do lm/glm on the data. However, the plots and control structure for gathering the data for the plots would be instructive."
Thanks for pointing that out Kevin. Couldn't see the link in the question itself - have issues with colors!
"Goal2 and 3 are directly related to promotion of girls education because they look at promotion of primary education and gender equality in addressing women challenges.In fact girls need to be supported from birth because of their feminism. Goal 4,5and 6  depend on the first goals and impact on girls more especially the reproductive health,including child mortality and maternity. young girls who had no chance to attend school find them selves in early marriages which is a risk factor to their health.Lack of literacy skills by women and girls is a key driver to gender based violence because of the low status in society. It is true to note that the Millennium development goals have contributed to the realization of Education for All,however given the report of the performance of these MDGs a lot is still desired to be done more especially in the area of education and health. "
Must relate. This was awesome.
"I absolutely agree with you NatMoon. All 8 MDGs are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment. According to the WHO Executive Summary on Women and Health, (2009), \within countries, the health of girls and women is critically affected by social and economic factors, such as access to education, household wealth and place of residence. In almost all countries, girls and women living in wealthier households have lower levels of mortality and higher use of health-care services than those living in the poorest households. Such differences are not confined to developing countries but are found in the developed world.\"" This effectively addresses Goals 1 and 8 as it affects women, especially in low-income countries struggling with development."

"HIV and AIDS education can take place in many different environments, from classes at school to families and friends sharing knowledge at home. It is important that this education is provided in a variety of settings to ensure that the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in society are reached, and that accurate information about HIV and AIDS is reinforced from different sources. The most common place for people to learn about HIV and AIDS is at school. Due to their capacity and universality, schools are a crucial setting for educating young people about HIV/ADIS As young people are at a high risk of becoming infected with HIV, it is vital that they are educated about HIV transmission before they are exposed to situations that put them at risk of HIV infection (for example, before they are sexually active). Schools play a major role in shaping the attitudes, opinions and behaviour of young people and so are ideal environments for teaching the social as well as the biological aspects of HIV and AIDS. Members of the wider community can also increase their knowledge about HIV and AIDS through the school environment. Teachers who expand their understanding of the subject while planning lessons and receiving teacher training can pass this information on to adults as well as pupils, and the same can be said for children themselves; once informed about AIDS, they can tell their parents or their friends what they have learned Educating people at work is an important way of providing people with vital prevention information, and can reach people who have previously missed out on HIV and AIDS education. Furthermore, it is estimated that nine out of ten people living with HIV are working. Providing education in the workplace is important for protecting those at work living with HIV, and for helping them to live healthily and stay in work"
"Yes, this was a mistake. Well caught."
"In order to address these goals, it is imperative to support women working on these issues within their own communities as well as globally. These goals will be impossible to meet if people do not adopt feminist views of inclusion, dialogue, and cooperation. If the world continues to be run by masculinists who believe they deserve whatever they can get their hands on, nothing will change. We need a revolution of thought."
"At the risk of seeming ungrateful (asking for more when already given so much) I second <redacted> suggestion.  I actually feel quite grateful -- I've participated in several of these online courses and this is the best, by far:  having access to the text (2 texts, in fact), the use of R, and the hard-to-quantify but engaging performance of the Professors are the factors that have made StatLearning very rewarding.  I would go a little further than <redacted> and ask for even more.  This course would be significantly improved if more of the lecture time was spent going through meaningful, real-world examples.  The excellent texts make much of the material in the videos -- not all, but a lot of it -- somewhat redundant, in my opinion, especially since the worked examples themselves could be chosen to emphasize the topic being presented."
"I have used the infographic as my desktop background for the last week and each time I see it, I'm reminded to come back to the course :)"
"It is very important to eradicate violence against women. I think it is better to call \domestic violence\"" \""domestic terror\"" or \""torture in the home\"" to show the impact of this kind of violence. Calling it different is a possibility to create a new consciousness among men and women and to show the horrible impact."
"The video of Jacqueline Pitanguy was very interesting. She mentioned some problems that must be resolved to fight against violence against women: In all countries it is very important to get more and better statistics, and it is important to get reliable statistics. With these statistics you can improve the visibility of the problem. "
"Back in the day, I used to do some pretty sophisticated stuff in GUASS: Monte Carlos, Bordered Hessians constrained optimization, simple SGE modeling, etc."
"This is a little mathematical, but here it goes: a non-regularized solution to an ordinary LS (OLS) is given by: inv(A'A)A'Y. ':Transpose, Y: observations. A weighted LS solution takes the form inv(A'WA)A'WY, where W is the weighting matrix. Now a regularized solution takes the form (without weighting to simplify the formula) inv(A'A + lambda*I)A'Y. So the Regularizer here is lambda*I where I is the identity matrix of appropriate size. So now here's my question: If I knew the correlation between the answers, how can I use that information to select a better Regularizer than lambda*I? "
"Under the link above for \Wiki\"", I think they want us to post our solutions. One link went to one student's attempts on github, but he only did up to Ch 6. I'll try to post some on the wiki page, hopefully get some discussion going."""
"Maybe he meant the change in the approach over the past few decades. As I've gathered from various lectures, previously, they had to do most work by hand, so it was better to use formulas, theories, and clever math to project how things would work. Today, with fast cheap computers, it's easier  to write some code for a simulation and observe what comes out, or put a link to \take a free survey for fun\"" and you get 100k responses very quickly.     "

"Being impoverished and being female are two of the greatest risk factors for contracting HIV-AIDS; these are the most important issues to address. Setting up ways of survival outside this impoverishing and unequal capitalist global economy that devalues females is essential to promoting women's health, education, and empowerment. Women must work outside of the systems that oppress them in order to remove themselves from secondary social positions that leave them powerless. Setting up women's communities to educate females, provide income and housing, and safety from oppressive males is, in my opinion, the best way of removing the threat of HIV/AIDS (as well as other symptoms of structural violence) from women's lives."
"Approximation methods that increase efficiency of this computation can be found also by querying Efficiently Indexing High Dimensional Data Spaces.

In other problems, side length of the n-cube would change as well or we may need to subtract its volume from that of an n-sphere first."

"I thought it was very interesting how she dealt with the question about the use of the word and the lens of human rights and why this is importante. For example, in the University of Bras¨ªlia/Brazil they have a program of going to less-structured cities and empowered women as to advogate their rights. This actions sounds simple, but they are made by a lawyer that coordenate law students as to pass not only information but really practical actions that these women can do for protect themselves and - really important - instruct others to do the same. So, as you said, it is important to be attuned with human rights, be they in the Constituion or not, because these small actions and empowered are the one that counts."

"I am from Kosovo, which is a post war country and yes the rape was used as a weapon to destroy a nation in long term basis by Serbian paramilitary forces and military ones. Though there is a phenomenon in my country that women who have experienced violence to their bodily integrity are not really encouraged to talk about it, seek help- psychological help, due to the shame and the fear of not being able to live a normal life, specially in finding a husband who might prejudice and even not support them.my country is poor and mechanisms for supporting human rights are not quite tangible for people in general."
"In Kosovo, my country there is a slight preference for son over daughter. The reason is that the son expands the family and en-tiles the family blood while the daughter expands someone else's family. Therefore, most of the times it is the man who inherits the wealth, property from his parents but not the daughter as the daughter will inherit what her husband inherits from his parents. All though girls/ daughters are educated and financed from their parents or even brothers or even her husband. The education is highly encouraged for her. I can not say there is any alarming fact for son over daughter preference in my country."

"I've enjoyed the exchange as well.  You've forced me to attempt to state clearly some things that I had previously only half thought about (I've never formally studied statistics; I'm self-taught; so this has been very educational for me).  You're right that we agree on most things now.  I think we still disagree on the fitted values, though.  As stated in the stackexchange quote in your first post in this thread, if you're willing to assume that the coefficients are normally distributed (say, by appealing to the CLT) then the fitted values will be normally distributed, as well, and pointwise confidence intervals formed by standard errors are a reasonable thing (of course, that's different than saying that the prediction interval will given by the predict function will be valid; that relies on the normality of the irreducible error).  So, rather than arguing that point with more math, I went ahead and continued the R code example you gave in your first post.  I found it educational, so I'll try posting it here in case you do too:"

If you don't specify a parameter in R it will use the default.  You are correct that 1 is the default in this case.  If you aren't getting the right answer you probably have a bug elsewhere in the code.  Maybe you could use a larger test set?  Or more replications?

Her explanation of the old-fashioned view of family values as one of the factors of the allergy against the treaty reminded me of a novel I have recently read, 'Revolutionary Road' written by Robert Yates. The novel mainly criticizes the suburban society in 1950s by portraying a typical American nuclear family. When I look into it in a perspective of women's rights, the protagonist struggles to break aprat from the role of woman as nothing more than a wife and mother of the children that the society implicitly forces upon her. In the end she dies after having abortion by herself. Even though it is a novel, I think it is partially related to her explanation about old family values and pro-life movement. "
The report of WHO overall shows how social and economic determinants of health influence women. Intersectoral collaboration is an effective means to promote actions outside the health sector and eventually enhance the health outcomes for women.

I disagree with the official answer.  I use linear regression very frequently in practice and at least for the data I study it is usually quite true and accurate.
"R fills matrices by columns, so I believe you need to add `byrow = TRUE` after `ncol = 10` (i.e. in the `matrix()` call to get the desired behaviour. R will recycle through `mean1` 100 times (to give the 1000 random variables we asked for) and hence the first 5 have mean 1, then next 5 mean 0, the next 5 mean 1 and so on. Hence the need to fill by rows."

"You don't need `mvrnorm()` at all; you can do this using `rnorm()` which has been used on the course. The error rate is the proportion of incorrect \answers\"" on independent test sets. The results tell us how we'd expect each method to perform on this problem for some new data; for this problem linear SVMs and logistic regression outperform, slightly, the more complex SVM with radial kernel. Also, learning how to do this kind of simulation is very useful as you approach a new problem. It was advanced a little beyond the level of some of the other questions, but that's what courses are for, to challenge the students. Perhaps it could have been explained better, and perhaps my judgement is clouded by the fact that I'm quite familiar with R, but once I'd read the question a couple of times and sat down with R and sketched out some code, the solutions ended up being relatively simple. It would certainly help in future if the \""Answer\"" was a little more helpful than the one provided for this question; if you struggle implementing the R code, the Answer provided isn't going to help you with that."""

"While it could be said that all eight millennial development goals are relevant to educating girls, I think that two are specifically related to educating girls. In order to achieve universal primary education, we must put into place programs that not only encourage girls to be in school, but stay in school. We must tackle this issue from both a traditional and non traditional approach. Girls must be encouraged that their education matters, and provided an opportunity to be educated in a way that does not place a greater financial burden on their families. Millenial Development Goal Three states that we are seeking to promote gender equality. It is clear by the continuing gender labor gap, that the key to achieving economic and social gender equality lies in educating girls. By putting girls in school we are achieving gender equality bit by bit. "

"When comparing the countries by achievements it is so eminent that a sufficient health care would be possible if certain prepositions are in place: good education, access to quality health care, individual wealth , absence of conflict . The disparity within a population and between the, is huge and leaves the poor and uneducated with a disasterous outcome. Same is true for gender based violence. Empowerment of women does not only serve the individual but the whole population. It is a way forward."

"Since the variables may be correlated to some degree, an easy solution to clearly see the importance of each variable on its own is to run each predictor separately in a single variable linear model, and look at $R^2$. But since this is equivalent to squared correlation, might as well run the function `cor` on the whole data.frame (you might also like the function `pairs`)."

Stress can make us fat. 
Fat is a very dense energy source and in conditions of extreme cold the body demands a lot of energy. That may be why the body craves much more fat in very low temperatures.
"The information given on pressurizing aircraft was slightly incorrect and I wanted to give some input. Aircraft pressurization is determined by the manufacturer when they design an aircraft. Some aircraft have the capability for a greater pressure differential between the cabin and outside atmosphere (typically smaller private jets). The pressurization system is generally controlled by letting air out of the cabin of the aircraft. The air conditioning system is always putting air into the cabin and the pressurization system determines how much to let out, thereby pressurizing the aircraft. It really has nothing to do with fuel. Up to a certain limit, most aircraft try to travel as high as possible to save on fuel. As altitude increases, air pressure decrease which requires less fuel. Otherwise, the information on jet lag and stagnant hypoxia are bang on. Great stuff!"

This could/will lead into other issues being discussed such as domestic violence in relationships, rape, religion and sexually transmitted diseases. Education in general gives people critical skills and tools to help them better provide for themselves and their children. It also helps people work better and can create opportunities for sustainable and viable economic growth now and into the future.

In my country and my culture, women's rights are valued and appreciated. Though there might be instances of physical abuse on women and children it is not something we condone. Opportunity on education and health are equally provided for both men and women. We have public schools and universities and public health centers. During the colonization in 1<phoneRedac> up to the end of ww2 the role of women and equality in the Philippines was not ideal. During Marcos regime the country was also in turmoil.

The Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials shown on the Wikipedia site are linear regression equations with increasing numbers of interaction terms. The \COMBI\"" method seems to be doing exhaustive subset search at each interaction level using mean-squared-error and either a separate test set or LOOCV to compute the error. The \""MIA\"" method does subset search across multiple interaction levels. It seems to me you could do much of this with the `leaps` package as shown in lab 6.5.1 of the book."""
"As Margaret Greene, Laura Cardinal and Eve Goldstein-Siegel suggest in Girls Speak: A New voice in global development, adolescent girls in extreme poverty are aware of their circumstances and eager to get beyond them. This has been my experience as well working for two years with WE LEARN (Women Expanding Literacy Action Resources Network). Women of all ages who missed the opportunities to get a formal education in the U.S. arrive at the doorstep of literacy affiliates around the country to begin anew. Some were put out of school and not reenrolled by a parent as young as 11 years old although we have compulsory and free education. In reading From Outrage to Courage, I became encouraged by Visaria¡¯s report on progress Nepal has made making education compulsory and free.  "

"Aaaah of course! I didn't think that logistic regression is very similar to linear regression. So here actually we have more unknowns (predictors) than equations (samples). Since X has column rank n, the linear system Xa=y has infinite solutions.

"I enjoyed the lectures,but would like to have had more discussion on the topic of microfinance. Ms. Krasnic brought it up in passing in her very informative talk. I would like to know if microfinance has a role in empowerment of women,as it can increase their independence and give them power in the small circle of their lives. I see that it is only a tool and not a solution, but am interested in more discussion on this topic."

"What surprised me the most was that, with a bachelors degree in Human Geography I was never presented with the declaration of human rights to read (and I never looked it up myself). While some rights are known, others are still important and knowing them should be basic for all children, youth and adults!"
"Yes we are a signatory and our expectations related to paid maternity leave and the role of women in our defence forces. Unfortunately that certainly does not mean that all women benefit from having their rights recognised. Australia is a mixture of many cultures and people from many countries and often they bring their beliefs and values with them, certainly not always to the benefit of women. While we recognise women's rights in many spheres we struggle to implement or maintain those rights for all women and not just those with the education and resources to sustain them."
"On preventing and treating HIV/AIDS, Gene Richardson made very credible points on how medical technology can undermine the introduction of social interventions. I particularly like and would surely follow his research to include the two groups of women with differing options to stay HIV-free."

"I have been a part of this course over the past few weeks but had not posted any comment. However, as I put together my assignments for submission, i have this strong urge to share the reflections i jotted in my notepad week after week. The Foreword and Prologue of our course text really brings to fore very important issues of women's health which even those of us who work on women's rights sometimes overlook. I hope to understand women's health better after this course and to help me make identify practically sustainable solutions to the issues especially those that affect women and young girls in Sub Sahara Africa where I come from."
"Surely, I also got same insight. This means that nations without money and wealth have a very long way to go with implementing the basic human rights in the treaties that they sign day in and out. This is a huge limitation for which their citizen suffer greatly. Unfortunately, they continue to sign new ones always. The amazing thing for me is that of countries who have the resources and still do not implement these treaties they sign on to."

"That is a very valid suggestion. Most of the time, girls do not understand the value of education in their life.

"Wow. The combination of framing questions posed by Anne and the depth of knowledge and understanding of AKILA RADHAKRISHNAN in responding to them is exceptionally hopeful for advancing the framing of ALL sexual violence (including in conflict regions and domestic)as a HUMAN RIGHTS issue and therefore, a CRIMINAL, not personal issue or egregious behavior during war explained away as \Inevitable\"" or \""collateral\"" damage.  How dare they. I find particularly useful the language comparing the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population (in Syria)and the use of sexual violence as a weapon against the civilian population.  Thank you so much for elevating the level of discourse to these real terms."

"Unfortunately not a lot of this information was new to me. I know that girls are under-educated. They are prevented from being educated for many reasons. Either it is not valued. They have other chores to do that take time away from her studies. Or it is cost prohibitive - parents cannot afford to send all their kids to school so keep the girls back. Education should be free. Governments must invest in education for all as it is a good investment. When you educate the young - both boys and girls - they will reinvest in the economy as adults. When you choose to not educate 50% of the population, you eliminate 50% of the potential for that country."
Thank you for that info. I had wondered what other reasons the US might have had for not ratifying the convention. I have wondered though if the US government at the time really did have the best interests of women in 1980. I suspect there is more to it than just that.

One intervention that came to mind for me during the Dr. Richardson interview as well as the readings was the providence of day care for working mothers. Having better systems in place for doing this - whether low-cost day care centers or 1-on-1 partnership models in which non-working women in the community could look after a single child for a few days a week could be an interesting way of transitioning the gender inequalities. There could be various ways of incentivizing HIV/AIDS education or drugs etc. through this model.
Prof  Hastie posted that the certificates should come shortly after the class is finished. I usually figure 2 to 3 weeks after the class is complete.
"After reading the Contents & Foreword, Prologue, and looking at the The World's Women and Girls 2011 Data Sheet, I was not shockingly surprised by the data on wife beating.  Not only is there a problem with this issue in other countries, but the U.S. as well.  Many women believe that it's okay that their husband/partner beat them because that's how they feel some type of \love\"" from them.  Many of these women were also exposed to domestic violence as children (watching their mothers and grandmother being beat) and view this type of behavior as a \""norm\"" in their country and household.  Although many of us believe that violence against women is wrong, there are some many uneducated women in the world who don't know how to fight for their rights as an individual.  This is an issue I hold close to my heart because I have seen so many women in my family go through this with no support.  Giving adolescent girls and young women a voice, an abundance of resources, and educating them about their rights is one of my life goals!!!!!!"""

"This is rather difficult reading to assimilate...killing baby girls in preference of boys.  It seems that there is an economical factor to choose boys over girls.  The girls are an economic burden whereas the boys are an investment.  Being born a girl in poor countries set you up for a life of scarcity and access to resources, lack of a position in the feeding system, lack of obtaining a good education...sad."

"This video was short but so instructive, it was like a crash lecture on understanding the history of human rights worldwide and I also really appreciated the explanation as to why the US does not sign UN documents (I also think regarding that is the possibility that it leaves the government and corporations working in US wide open for more lawsuits). I clearly understand now the positive rights vs negative rights and have a clear detailed of the timeline of the history of human rights. It is surprising how new this concepts still are."

"In our first reading and as we are learning about the history of Human Rights, Im wondering is rape consider a form of warfare by the Geneva conventions? Or was this part of the rectifications.

To speak of human rights, for all people should be given the right to use them. Only then we can say that in our country there are human rights."
"In my opinion, the first chapter is the foundation for the entire course. The most important issue in equality or the right to development for every individual are human rights. I think that the first chapter very well presents the topic and describes the most important issues. It is very important that it shows the importance of human rights and their observance."
<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>><redacted>
In my opinion the right to education is one of the most important human rights. I think that the world should be total equality of access to the school. Every boy and every girl should have a guarantee of education from an early age. Through education possible is the development and independence.
I think that first three of goals are the most important and directly related with girls education.

Dear Students
CV error is not training set error.
I agree with you completely.
"I loved reading the book ¡°From Outrage to Courage.¡± Even from the very subtitle, ¡°The Unjust and Unhealthy Situation of Women in Poorer Countries and What THEY Are Doing About It,¡± Professor Murray seems to turn traditional power dynamics on their head. We are not posed as students learning only how to help the atrocious Human Rights inequalities in the world, but learning how those disenfranchised women are helping themselves gain power, in this global human rights movement, as part of the third wave of feminism discussed in the last chapter. ¡°They,¡± women of the world, are taking their power and voice. ¡°They¡± are not asking other authorities to give them power, but demanding it, in her statement. I add the emphasis to the word ¡°they¡± because I see the very use of ¡°they¡± versus ¡°we¡± gives the power, control and agency not to ¡°us¡±  students, other members of society, or men, to save women, but back to the women themselves to help run their lives. Helping those in need is a beautiful thing, but to create something local, sustainable, allowing autonomy is even more important.  This wording choice seemed very deliberate to me, and I so enjoy the empowering context it sets up for the rest of the book."
"I think it is a brilliant idea to include minimum quotas on women in legislation and government, where countries are reworking their constitutions. I think it is wonderful that women are about 60% of the parliament in Rwanda. It would be interesting to study how that may impact the country in the future. It is so much higher than the US."
"I love the idea that when children learn of HR, they then feel empowered, and learn of a life that may be different than their own. "
"I think it is interesting that the Unites States is not a party to the Convention to Elimination All Forms of Discrimination Against Women treaty. Professor Stacy discussed America's \allergy\"" to treaties and strong sense of sovereignty. On one hand I understand why the US is reluctant to do anything that may decrease sovereignty. But if the US signed it seemed that may help some other countries. It seems very odd in many ways, although we encourage these things in other countries, the US sometimes feels above signing the treaty itself. It is also interesting if the pro-life debate has influenced this decision. "

Block resampling.  It was one of the HW questions and there are forum posts about.
I believe rape can be argued to be a crime of warfare and torture based upon the Geneva Conventions. The representative from Global Justice seemed to allude to as much.

"Gene Richardson point of view on preventing HIV using social and non medical intervention is incredible.Use of social networks such as twitter,face book,Google groups among others.These social networks bring together a bigger population and share ideas very effectively. However the social media has done much to destroy the non medical strategy to reduce HIV. However the trend for HIV prevention is also been affected by culture and norms.Its true to say that the non medical intervention will be    doing a great job to reduce the HIV infections in Uganda but communities lost strength to undertake the interventions on board."

"This course is really an eye opener to me, Akila spoke about the rule of law which promotes gender equality, I believe both male and female are equal before the law and human Rights promotes gender equality."
"Son preference is still an issue in my country Nigeria, when a woman delivers the first thing they would ask is the sex of the child and there is a region that thinks that female children are not children, until a man has male children he is treated badly by his family and his wife sometimes are sent packing and the man is encouraged to take another wife"
"I just want to say a big thank you to you, Anne, Kevin, and all of the others who have worked so hard to put this course on-line. It has been a terrific experience. I thought I knew a fair bit abt many of the topics only to learn that there is so much more to know. I have never done a MOOC before but jumped at the chance to take this when I saw it mentioned on the Global Fund for Women's website."

"Dear Prof. Hastie and Prof. Tishbirani,"

"This video gives an interesting background to the development of women's human rights. It gives us three good reasons why despite ratification of international law, many national governments fail to adequately recognise and protect women's rights. An additional reason is complex national constitutions which make domestication difficult. It is apparent that \sovereignty\"" is a sacrifice that has to be made to fully give attention to these instruments. Nigeria has passed provisions of CEDAW and CRC. CRC has been domesticated into an Act. However states have the responsibility of passing this into sate law. In Nigeria, there is reluctance by northern states to pass the Child Rights Act into a law. In effect, many young women and children remain vulnerable and unprotected."""
This interview is a great background for this course by emphasizing that women's rights must be addressed through gender lens and a human rights framework. They are not merely development goals but fundamental human rights. I also was struck when she mentioned that gender equality is true rule of law.
There was. The Amazon price was about the same as the discounted price.
I loved the R exercises. I actually use the R code examples for my work!
Thanks for the great course.  Just what I needed R and ML.   Murray Hill lives!
"did you just add a weight variable? that seems like for random forest it would make it really easy to predict the binary class, as there is a one-to-one correspondence between an observation's weight and its class. there is a parameter weights used in logistic regression in R as well, but in a different way; it seems to be just a different way to represent the data. http://psychweb.psy.umt.edu/denis/datadecision/binary_logistic_R/index.html,"

"I also very much agree with the above mentioned points. Me too, I especially enjoyed the second reading, bringing forward the point that from an external point of view the number one issue regarding women's health is linked to their childbearing role. However, from an internal point of view (as Ghanian women told it) the major issues are the psycho-social health problems, that are continuously have affecting women, not only during childbearing."
"I also had in mind the question: should cultural norms be changed in cultures where they see female children less valuable thus leading to abortion or killing. I think yes, because it is a question of rights, for which some cultures should grow up to understand them, to understand that human rights concern all of us, men and women."
"I also agree with Wu Qing that women should be renown as change agents because they already are. They should be empowered to give them the ability to help them support their families. They have to know about their rights. SYB (start your business) initiative is extremely interesting and is a tool for empowering women. As it has been said there is still a long way to go, however, internal and external efforts are very much needed."
"While I was reading this article and thinking about the importance and the role of youth, I directly thought about the youth fighting for their rights in the Arab countries since the Arab spring started. For me that group of young people gives the perfect example for this article as they struggle with the issues, problems mentioned in the article. Women were also present at Tharir square, and they were especially subject of violence, abuse and rape. Those brave women went there to stand up for their rights, their wish for a more democratic country, therefore I think we or in general NGOs and other organizations should address and analyze this point."

"I agree with the comment regarding Analytics Edge. I have taken many courses that use R, and that class has given me the most amount of practice than any other, simply because it has a high workload with 3-4 different problem sets with different data sets to work with each week. I am a polyglot programmer, so it was easy for me to pick up R, but all I needed was lots of hands-on R practice and that class provides a ton.

"Hello,"

Thanks for this great course! It was an absolute pleasure.
Maybe EdX could fix improve the Discussion experience to get it up to Coursera standards
"Many thanks to Trevor and Rob for a great course. A bit of humour makes a big difference and tag-teaming works well to aid understanding. Like many participants, I did not devote as much time to the course as I would have liked, given the pressures of work. For this reason especially, I am grateful that the materials could all be downloaded for later study. The free PDF version of the book was a very generous gesture. Our library already has a copy of ESL2, so although the maths looks a bit scary, I intend to dip into this too."
0.1 is ok
"0.12 is safer, though (I got the answer marked as wrong when the difference to the correct answer was 0.04)"
"Proactively educating girls and removing gender stereotypes from the curriculum seems like a very good idea the New Lessons chapters raise. This would require serious reflection on the part of the teacher on the societal norms. Trying to break and breakdown such norms would not be easy. But as I read in material for this class if people know their human rights, they can call upon them. Similarly if girls are taught without gender stereotypes and, even a step further are taught sensitively what the gender stereotypes in their society are, they can single them out when faced with inequality in their own lives."
I think all of the MDG's  listed relate to girls. And it can be argued that they all relate to education.
I too want to thank Prof. Hastie and Prof. Tibshirani for this great course. This is really a great course. I really appreciate your effort. I am start reading the ESL2 book. It becomes much easy to understand after this course. It is really a good book. I'll keep a copy on my desk. Hopefully an advanced course will be provided later :) Thanks again.
Thank you!

You need to post this in final submissions not here
I absolutely agree with you for my final submission I chose education as he most important human right.
"I will also join in and praise this course! Learning methods that weren't even taught when I was in graduate school has been great. I really appreciate being able to have copies of both books. I will even buy ESL. More courses on advanced statistical modeling would be amazing. But regardless, thank you!!!"
I think being informative is a great idea. This is a very sad situation
"Would love to hear more from her as well, all the speakers in this course are amazing"
I couldn't have worded this better myself thank you foe your input
Totally agree!!
"So, we are now at the end of the course. What a journey it was ! This was the first ever MOOC  I have participated and I will cherish it all my life. This was so different from a brick-and-mortar class. I enjoyed the challenge of balancing work life, family life with this course. I wish I were the same eager student in my (mis)spent college/university life !"
"I congratulate Mr. Hastie and Mr. Tibshirani and all the Statistical Learning staff for this course. I have taken previously other courses about similar material (usually under the name of \machine learning\"" or similar) and I must say that this course is excellent. I would also like to thank the authors of the books ISL and ESL for allowing us to access these books.    Very good job!... and, please, let me know if you plan more courses like these!"""

"When reading in the data sheet about the (conditional) acceptability of domestic violence, I was not surprised.

All these ideas were conditional. When given the condition that there had been past sexual experiences, 31% of boys and 32% of girls said that rape, in this case, was acceptable. Under the circumstances that ¡°the boy spent a lot of money on the girl,¡± 41% of girls and 51% of boys said that rape was okay. If the couple had been dating for more than six months, then 47% of girls and 65% of preteen boys said that the rape was okay. And if the couple was married, 87% of boys and 79% of girls said that rape was okay. "

**Why do so many players play one year of basketball in college then forgo the remainder of their college career to enter the NBA?**
"There seems to be *some* correlation between the lows in the graph and the existence of the USSR (i.e., *systemic* competition to capitalist economy). Certainly the rapid rise occurs at about the time of the collapse."
"College basketball players forgo the remainder of their eligibility to pursue an NBA career because the opportunity cost of remaining in college,even on a scholarship, is larger than the opportunity cost of entering the NBA and leaving college early. An NBA player can sign lucrative contracts with teams and sponsors, and these earnings can offset the scholarship and any possible future earnings from a college degree. Players also have to weigh the possibility of suffering a career ending injury in college which would be a substantial opportunity cost if they remained in college. Given the substantial opportunity cost staying in college and risk losing substantial earnings due to injury or wasted time, the age limit should be eliminated to allow athletes to maximize their earnings."

"The Opportunity Cost of forgoing the rest of a college education to potentially make millions playing basketball is an interesting problem. Whilst the athlete has (presumably) only paid one year of tuition, he is not so 'out of pocket' by taking the chance to play in the NBA. "
I graduated from USTC as well!  Good to see alumnus here!  Same goal!
The opportunity cost of drop the restriction is the reduction of the whole league's competitive level and player's literacy.Most of high school players have not matured enough?whether physically or emotionally?one year of college career provide the future players a relatively relaxed environment to improve some crucial qualities for professional players just like psychological quality?social skill....
"Hello,"
The opportunitiy cost of that decison is the salary that basketball player could be making as a professional. Same as Tiger Woods example we have just seen on the second video.

Yes I agree as well
"It is mentioned here that the player should be at least one year removed from his high school. I did not see any rational idea behind this rule, because neither they are seeking college graduation for the players nor they are satisfied with the high school graduation. As it rightly mentioned that most high school graduates who want to become players with the NBA would be joining college for 1 year and leaving after that for going to NBA. This would imply a high opportunity cost on the part of the students if they dropped from the college and did not even got selected at NBA because it will also be having some finite seats. From economics point of view there is an opportunity cost not only on the part of the students who left the college after 1 year but also on the part of the concerned college as it could have offered admission to someone likely to finish the graduation from the college( mostly in the case of govt funded colleges).The opportunity cost on the part of the student would be even higher if goes to some very expensive college."
I noticed that a lot of people defend the case for dropping the restriction so I would like to use the concept of opportunity cost to make a case for increasing the limit.

Hi everyone!
"Hello everyone! my name is Veronica, I'm from Dominican Republic. I have a Bachelor's on Hospitality Administration and work in Risk and Compliance now in a Bank.

"It's no surprise to anyone that NBA stars, and even players who are little known, make millions each year. While some of these players may be motivated students with a passion for an outside interest, the majority are likely young adults with a desire to play basketball full-time and earn as much money possible doing what they love. While getting an education is seen as a high achievement by society, one of the primary incentives to get a college degree is a steady income. For a young person faced with the opportunity to make millions of dollars a year doing the \hobby\"" they love dearly, the answer is simple; Staying in college is far too costly, forcing them to give up years of a seven figure income."""
"I am a programmer too, from Hungary =)"
"But if they go professional directly when graduating from high school, the experience gained from NBA would be much more valuable than that of gained from a college league. In this sense, the opportunity cost for them to go to college would be much higher."
"Hello! I_m also from Spain, i certainly hope that they do deliver certificates here as no problem was found to register and apply for the course."
Hello! Telecommunications Engineer from Spain! Enjoying the videos very much so far :)
"Yeah, There is a mistake!"
Looks like plenty of graduate engineers are taking this course :D
This problem is similar to the Tiger Woods example That Prof. Taylor used. The opportunity cost that a player would loose by spending a year more in college is way more that than the advantage he would get by paying for a year extra by skipping college.

I agree with you when it speaks how hard is understand Micro and Macro Economics because one leads each other. I want to learn more because the subject affects all of the world and it is difficult to understant.
The opportunity costs for dropping this restriction means players will be allowed to enter the NBA sooner instead of paying a year for college.  Opportunity cost in this case is the year of college.
"Dropping the restriction would allow high school players avoid attending college and therefor hurt ticket sales for NCAA colleges, but possible increase the ticket sales for NBA games.   I don't think that the increase in NBA sales would be greater than the lost ticket sales for NCAA basketball games.  I think increasing the time required to attend college would be better."
"So, great to see so many people from different countries with such different backgrounds."
i think care about micro economy is important for macro.... why i say it becouse :
"Intuitively, and following the narrative around minute 5, I would have expected demand to be a function of price, and therefore the price to be on the x-axis, and the demand to be the function value on the y-axis."

"As i live in Sain I don_t know the exact situation of both education and sports opportunities. I played basketball when I was a kid I played basketball and the main restriction came physically. You need to be very tall and strong to be successful. To study those barries are much lower, with effort and hard work you can accomplish almost everything you want. If you were to risk your student life I think you should at least have a good educational base, in case something goes wrong such as injuries or poor performance."
I agree too!
"if  consumption causes the PPC to shift inward (indicating a drop), then it should have the same effect for GDP. Just saying"
"My understanding is that the article lists China's increasing reliance on mining of metals to diminish the losses the mining industry is currently experiencing. Although the price is low and supplies continues to rack up, the belief is that China's increasing demand will cut into that surplus and raise the equilibrium once again to raise the price of metals out of its four-year low."
"As was mentioned earlier in the welcome video/address, Tiger woods decided to forgo the college for his golf career. There is a concept in economics known as scale of preference and it helps in prioritizing items/things that need to be done or bought. So first of all priority between the NBA and college sets in, and the players think that what they can achieve in the NBA is more compared to what they'ld gain in college and so forgo colllege at the expense of the NBAs. So the real cost is college."
"I suppose what he was saying that the debt ceiling would be so high, that the country that owned that debt would own the United States...such countries such as China."
"From Colombia, I'm a nutritionist and I want to learn and enjoy this course at Stanford"
"The given arrangement provides a student to access his opportunity (of making a career in basket ball vis-a-vis academic career). The first year he does both and the current arrangement is based on the assumption that the person (after one year of doing both- study and basketball) he is in a good shape to access his opportunity cost. The opportunity cost may vary from person to person. Some may vie for money, some for fame and others for satisfaction in what they are doing."
I agree
I'm from Hong Kong. It's great to see the global mix here
"This is economics, so looking at it purely this way, ( which is against my better judgement because I believe in education) I would not support the ruling of having the potential player do one year of school and be allowed to enter into the NBA. The younger player would have a high financial additional opportunity cost ( given no injury and skill level as a variable to consider) and have the additional year in the league to participate since players over the age of 30 are considered old. Also, there is no time limit for education and he could then return and not have any student loans and receive his diploma. Looking at all the variables of course that come into play in figuring out this choice, like which league...SPURS are winners and Heat not so much...."
"Personally, I think the NBA should increase the limit, so that players should finish college first. That is because that would be like an investment. Most players will not be top players. On the other hand, some training in college may let them succeed in other activities that can make the production possibility curve to shift. Just playing basketball as medium quality player may not have the same effect in the curve."
"What I find quiet interesting, is that in the given examples of macro-economic subjects, there were (at least to for me) no surprises... as for the micro-economic side, I was surprised to see something as healthcare policy there. Being from Belgium and having a state organised healthcare system (and one of the best in the world in my opinion) I could argue that this is a more macro-economic topic as it affects the whole society."
There are the advantages though of proving themselves capable of playing at a higher level and competing on a big stage (March Madness anybody?) - strong performances in the college system can influence drafting order and play into a better career down the line.

I) Explanations ;
"I should say that I agree with the recommendation of the author to invest in the youth. I am no economist but although the author spend a lot of effort to explain the Gini Coefficient and it's value through out the world, he did not provide any data for the parameters that controls the disparities and support his hypothesis. He basically named a few possible factors with the emphasis on the role of the government and its policies but failed to follow an economic explanation for the recommendation."
"Specialization of the particular components of the economy to produce a good will increase the opportunity cost of producing another good. For example, robots that produce cars will need to be replaced/refitted to produce TVs. That's part of the opportunity cost."
"That's a good point. Also, the players want to \strike when the iron is hot.\"" They aren't guaranteed that they won't get injured in 4 years, in addition to the many dangers that threaten their careers. Getting into the NBA now is a more secure and sound decision."""
"If most prospective NBA players drop out of college their first year it makes more sense to drop the restriction. 1. As most basketball players get full rides to colleges, it would save institutions money not to have to pay for players at all and 2. Most professional athletes can only play for so many years so it makes more sense to go into the NBA immediately"
**good luck ..**
"3 additional years of an NBA salary is more appealing than waiting 3 years to obtain the degree. More of an \instant gratification\"" mentality... therefore the perception of said college freshman is that there is lower opportunity cost leaving the degree behind and going to the NBA after year 1 of college."""
thank you!!!!
"There was a market failure in that the market provided bad information, there were conflicts of interests, and the failure of ratings agencies.  The government had withdrawn from its previous role in regulating the financial markets, in part when it did away with the Glass-Steagel Act.  So the government failed to serve its role in regulating the market."

"The most obvious opportunity cost is the 1 year wasted in college before a player can begin earning a salary from the NBA.  However, putting the salary lost into perspective over the player's entire life shows the lost wages can be small.  The real opportunity cost is the lost education from not finishing college and the ability to mature before earning tons of money.  The player will only make a large salary while they are young and likely won't manage the money well.  Taking the time to get an education that can be used when the NBA salary is gone and learning to reinvest the wages in the good time would be a better bet.  In this case the larger opportunity cost of dropping out means that requiring NBA players to graduate college would be better policy."
Hi Aaron!!
Well nobody loses anything if the college athlete wants to step up and try for NBA why not? The player could always return to college. It is only one year the college can decrease on number of students.
Many players opt to drop out because the possibility of making millions represents a significant opportunity cost of completing college.
"In the real world as it stands now, the \one and done\"" rule applies to future NBA players. This stated, the real opportunity cost that I would think about is the likelihood that a good player would be offered a significant salary as a professional player. As I have had the opportunity to watch a number of players from Kansas join the NBA, while a few of them have gone on to become very good at their craft, most of them start out in the developmental league or find themselves playing professionally for smaller European leagues. Unfortunately, most young people may not have the foresight and maturity to accurately evaluate their value in the marketplace (I know I didn't when I was 18 years old). Add to this the uncertainty of being chosen in a draft where selection is done by lottery, and you end up with what we have happening today, an NBA that, while producing good entertainment, is not producing very good basketball players. My personal recommendation would be to increase the time required to TWO years of collegiate basketball, thereby eliminating the arbitrary post secondary time restriction and giving these young people the time and coaching to learn their craft. I think that this way, economically, they would become more efficient and better producers of competitive basketball."""
"Because the NBA currently requires all basketball players to be one year removed from their high school graduation in order to enter the league, players who may have no intention of going to college are forced to attend in order to stay competitive in the one year they are not allowed acceptance into the league. The opportunity cost is that NBA players who are overwhelmingly concentrated on their athletic careers will be stuck in classes they have no motivation to succeed in, leaving both the player frustrated and the league short of a potential asset. While one person pointed out that very few athletes end up becoming stars, it is also most likely true that few athletes will be determined to attain academic achievements while their professional basketball careers are their priority in their prime years. "

"The value of making millions of dollars as an NBA professional player outweighs a four year college career on just a scholarship.  Plus opportunity cost, a professional basketball player can always attend college at anytime but while they are young and fresh out of high school they stand a greater chance in getting drafted to the NBA. Third, foregone opportunity, maybe playing basketball is all they ever dreamed of doing and the whole purpose of attending college is to pick a career and make money and playing in the NBA was a career choice and they would make a whole lot of money. Specialization is my final response,if they are more skilled in this area than any other then their chances of success and comparative advantage would be greater. Other than that to attend college for 4 years and get injured could create a foregone opportunity to play in the NBA."

"This one year gap might provide these young players a period of time to think about their future life. But if the limit is increased to the whole college period, this opportunity cost would be too large for not only the salaries as a player in four years, but also the golden times for young people as players. Athletes improve and show their talents just in the age of from about 18 to 25, and if they enter the NBA after they graduate from college, it would be a waste of time and talent. This oppotunity cost is much more than their salaries."

"One thought to expand on this comment:  Playing in college may not be as good of an investment as playing professionally.  So, it might be a better investment for basketball players to increase their production potential through training in the NBA than in college.  If we are discussing the production potential of a player in only basketball skills, and not including other forms of education, than the NBA would be a better choice earlier on than college training."
"I agree with removing the restriction.  In terms of opportunity cost, players forgo the chance at college in order to start a career and salary with the NBA.  If they drop out of college, players are willing to pay the cost and experience of college for the chance to play for the NBA.  In terms of basketball as a skill, they will likely succeed more by training with the NBA than by staying and training in a collegiate program.  Plus, their age and youth is a factor in their success in the field so the sooner (younger) they can join the NBA, they will have more earning potential than if they waited after finishing college.  The one year restriction seems unnecessary because it isn't long enough to encourage players to commit to a college program, but it also prevents them from starting as soon as possible.  The rule is likely in place to insure that each player will be 18 and therefore an adult - which is an example of how government intervenes in a market economy; a law in which government has imposed to protect workers in different fields."
"In every situation, there is a price to pay(opportunity cost); if high school graduates are allowsd to join NBA immediately, they will be an opportunity cost for not going to college to ahve their degree,so I believe the restriction should be removed althogether and allow the children to make their own decisions especially those the talent."
I think your point is right and cost for completing a whole college before being drafted into NBA will not be just waste of time and money but miss opportunity in once career
to decide the real opportunity cost we must be aware of the options there. what university and school is the player forgoing and what is his talent level in basketball. for example if average player is forgoing medicine school or law school the opportunity cost is very high. But if the player is forgoing average or low level school and university for a high salary and promising career then the opportunity cost will be very low. 
"This article shares a lot of insights into the growing gap between the rich and the poor.  One of the issues I would like more details on is the correlation with automation and increased complexity and uncertainty.  This requires a much higher level of education, skill and capability than past generations... resulting in less opportunities for the younger generation as they are unable to develop these capabilities as a part of their degree.  The challenge then is to gain access to to this knowledge  in the new technologies so you can continue to demand a premium salary."
"Well, if the student chooses to pursue a basketball career with the NBA, then seemingly the gains of giving up the rest of their college years seems to outweigh the loss.  The lucrative nature of an NBA career is just too good to pass up so the loss of the college Years is a no brainer. BUT    I like the idea of letting students enter the NBA after hight school but its not the best solution....you'll have a bunch of high school educated jocks unprepared for life beyond sport. But The opportunity cost - the cost of the decision of increasing the limit, and requiring benefit or profit of requiring students to graduate college before entering the NBA - is the increase of well educated basketball players who have skills to take with them into life after the NBA"
"I would say yes.  Opportunity cost is a personal cost, not a constant across participants in the economy.  Personal skill sets, priorities (ethics, etc), and societies \willingness to pay\"" for certain good and services determine OC."""
I agree with the above comment as I fail to understand.
"Assuming that the players who drop out do so because the opportunity cost of remaining in college is outweighed by the benifit of playing in the NBA for the 2 or three years, you would need to see the benifits to the NBA of having the year out restriction in place."

"Economists disagree because of their different backgrounds: culture, education or levels of understanding. Not everybody comes up with the same idea or solution to a problem... the question is how to bring them to a unitary vision. Not always those who decide in these institutions have a deep understanding of the phenomena or the consequences of their choices. In practice, their decision are biased and more or less vitiated... IMF can be an example..."
"I tend to agree with the concept that the inequality of income is not the issue, but rather the inequality of opportunities.   I believe we must not covet what others have and we must focus on being happy with what we have and exploiting the available opportunities in front of us.  If there are not many opportunities then we must adjust policy to increase the opportunities or make our own opportunities."
"As increasing the limit requires players to graduate college before entering the NBA, they might have less opportunity cost because they have more time to figure out which one to choose. After they have graduated from the high school, they get one more year to compare the result of joining the NBA as a career or finishing their college degree. If there is no restriction, some people who have talent in the learning area might fail in NBA as it is less suitable for them."
"It is hardly surprising why so many promising high school basketball players opt to forgo completing a college education and instead start their NBA careers as early as possible.  For them, the opportunity costs of completing college are high indeed: 4 years deducted from already short careers, 4 years of multi-million dollar contract pay lost (versus scholarships in the hundreds of thousands of dollars), potential endorsement deals and additional benefits lost, and the NBA basketball skills that could have been acquired lost (I mention this because NBA play differs substantially from college play).  There are also the ever-looming possibilities of injury and of not being drafted at the end of four years (if, for example, a player were not to perform as well in college as expected), which are not opportunity costs so much as risks foregone, but still factors that go in to making this decision."
"Basketball needs strong ang agile people, so in general the players need to start trainiing very young. If NBA dropped this restriction players would not be that great in general and it would lost millions of dollars. So the opportunity cost in that scenario would be bigger in comparison to the ongoing rule of players beiing removed at least one ear from highschool."
Forgoing college is a high opportunity cost for the individual. I am for requiring the players to finish college. This way when they finish their NBA carreers they will have something to fall back. The opportunity cost is not wasted.
"Now the refined copper market is oversupplied, so the prices have fallen nearly 10 per cent in 2014. Then some small compamyies have closed, and the quantity of supply will decrease as a result. But Stefan Boel, a board member at Aurubis, the European smelter and manufacturer of copper products, noted that demand for wire rod has risen by up to 5 per cent year on year in Europe. When the quantity of supply drop to the same level as that of demand, the price will go back to the equilibium price."

"would it be prudent to consider that demand for a product flattens off when its consumption or usage reaches an optimum level of need? if the purpose that is to be met a product is satisfied by another product, it would mean that the demand for one of those products would decrease. considering the case of transportation industry, if the price of flying is cheaper and since it also takes less time, people would be inclined to fly rather than say travel by train or road. in this case, the demand for rail or inter-state bus services would be hampered. since this lopsided balance has been generated by a free market rein, which is also one of the roles of government, should the government provide any incentives for the rail and bus services industry? in doing so would the government not be acting towards over protectionism and control of market forces?"

I agree with you. But in light of the first video Pharmaeconomics theme relates mainly to microeconomics.
"I would say that we need to first determine what it is that we are producing.  Are we trying to produce NBA players or college graduates? Or both? If we are producing both, then I can see that requiring one year would be an efficient point on the Production Possibilities Curve, while requiring an advanced degree (like a Master's or PhD) would be an impossible point and no college education might be inefficient.  If basketball players went on to advanced degrees, they would most likely forgo an NBA career altogether, making it impossible to produce both college students and NBA players.  However, basketball players that do not attend one year of college may lack the advanced skill that comes with college-level competitive sports and the independence that comes from the first year of college, therefore being inefficient in their contributions to the advancement of the team, professional business decisions, etc. So some middle ground would be the most efficient."
"i think that when you are going to Macro economics you have to go first to Micro economics, the two types are really related and it is good idea to cover both in the course"
Increasing the limit of requiring players to graduate college is a better alternative considering the economic perspective. This gives them a chance to always come back and do something better for the country when they're done playing NBA.
"If the NBA decreased the limit, allowing players to play in the NBA immediately after high school, this would be beneficial to both the league and the players themselves. When players decide to go to the NBA after just one year of college, they are using the concept of opportunity cost in multiple ways. For one, players understand that their future in basketball relies solely on there physical ability to perform. Basketball is a fast-paced game that, like any other high-level sport, comes with a severe risk of injury. The more years potential NBA players spend in college, the more games they are playing in which they are risking injury for no economic reward seeing as college athletes cannot be paid. For this reason, players seek the security of the guaranteed money in an NBA contract as soon as possible. Also, players and those around them realize that a career in a professional sport does not last as long as other careers that college graduates may pursue. Top level NBA players are lucky to have careers that last into their thirties. Prospective NBA players realize this and leave college as early as possible in order to have the longest career they possibly can before they are too old to play in the league. From the league's point of view, eliminating the risk of injury for the top players who are ready to play in the NBA after high school is very beneficial. Many players with superstar potential have been injured in college and this hurts the NBA's income. As a league, the NBA relies heavily on its star players because they are extremely valuable and marketable assets. The opportunity cost of staying in college is too great compared to the multi-million dollar contracts that can be obtained upon entrance to the NBA. While some may argue that requiring the completion of college will be beneficial to the economy when the players can have post-NBA careers, there simply are not enough players to really have an impact on a national scale."
"I am curious as to whether there have been attempts to create subjective economic models.  Specifically, the question came to mind during the discussion of opportunity cost, and I found myself considering that a purely monetary approach does not seem to capture the whole picture.  For example, consider an incompetent baseball fanatic who is also a gifted, but anti-health care, surgeon.  Although the straight, financially-based opportunity cost assessment says that successful surgeon beats failed baseball player, this is obviously not the whole picture."
"Hi,"
"Let's not forget debt brings interest payments with it, which makes it harder for government to accomplish its goals as the interest payments go higher"
"In my opinion I think the opportunity cost for NBA players will be less if the restriction gets dropped. Because players are losing one year of professional training at the league, I got the point of at having this rule players will have some knowledge when they finish their NBA life, but when they are doned with the NBA, lets say after 10 years of playing, the knowledge they got will be useless for them."

"I believe this article is well thought out and follows the economic explanation quite well. However, I wish it spent more time on central banks increasing the income gap."
"i think we can simulate the case study like the example of the lecture computers & movies, so players with no college  will be like movies and players with 1 year college will be like computers so i think it is better to keep the case as it is and keep the restriction as it as we need to go to the investment"
I feel opportunity cost is higher for dropping this restriction altogether.

"True. I think we will learn more about this later but here is [the Gini coefficient for the US against time][1]. The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality. You can see how the U.S. has changed towards more income inequality in the past 40-50 years.![Income Gini Ratio, U.S., Investormill.com][2]"
"The way I see it the players are getting no benefit from the one year rule, neither are the colleges or the NBA. The one year rule wastes resources for the players (their time and money) and for the colleges (time and money spent on administration). Dropping the rule would mean that the hopeful players would either get into the league and progress with their athletic careers or they would be rejected and have to come up with an alternative plan a year earlier-- which would be beneficial for everyone. "
"Hi Henry, "
"In the first and direct instance, the opportunity cost of remaining in college is the NBA-level salary foregone during the college years.  However, there's an opportunity cost of making the move to the NBA after one year: that is any potential incremental income that might arise from being more highly rated among NBA candidates at the end of years 2, 3 or 4.  This needs to be balanced by the fact that, waiting beyond the first year also entails the risk of career-ending injury sustained during college play.  Finally, waiting until graduation allows the player to acquire skills that may be valuable post-NBA.  In that sense, waiting is a hedge against a shortened or ultimately unsuccessful NBA career.  It seems that the ultimate decision by each player depends on the weight he places on each of the factors."
"Hello aravind, "
"Many players might forego their college education to become a professional in order to be paid a lucrative NBA contract. The opportunity cost of staying in college is considerably large as they give up not only millions of dollars in prospective income but also years of experience of being a professional. I would argue that the restriction should be expanded to graduating college so that the athlete does not have the daunting task of choosing between going professional or a college education, a decision a seventeen or eighteen year old might not be prepared to make."
"The percentage of potential professional-caliber basketball players is small, and the percentage of those that benefit from this rule is even smaller. This rule essentially forces all potentiates to test-drive college for one year, the opportunity cost being the money they might make from a contract, which will be significant in all possible cases; **a year's salary for even the worst pro player will be more than the year's salary for any professional**. If offered the opportunity, any person with the potential would not refuse the offer,for the reason above-5 or 6 years work in the NBA can equal the lifetime salary for any professional."
I find useful this concept to understand what happens in Colombia because the government is stimulating mining investment (extraction of gold and other metals) which in the long term does not lead to growth....
A year is enough for a born basketball player to know whether he should continue with the chosen university career in that academic year or preferably start his other career as the salary to be accrued as a player. Then the NBA rule is justified and understood perfectly.
"If it says 2, it's 100% rise rather than 200%"
Yes the equality of opportunities is more important than equality of income cuz equality of opporunity could lead to equality of income
"In addition to increased returns on education, the article mentioned emerging economies, which usually experience a temporary large income inequality gap, but it also mentioned crony capitalism as a problem, and lack of investment in young people. These were 2 of the main issues that the article suggested could be reversed to improve inefficient income inequality. It didn't come down on the side of equal opportunity or equal outcomes. I think everyone would agree that these 2 issues are important and no one, except a handful of kleptocrats themselves, would object to these changes."
"Hi guys,"
Allowing students to enter the NBA immediately after college has a lower opportunity cost than increasing the limit requiring players to graduate college before entering the NBA.
Thank you very much! It helps very much.
"The year's salary of even the worst player should be weighed against the time, (number of years), a player can remain active as a player.  We know that the playing/performing life in basketball is fairly short, thus a calculation should be made by the player as to whether or not that player can sock away or invest the salary so that player has something left aside for \retirement.\""  If the player is not incredibly famous what will the player do to make money after retirement, (remember they will not have a college degree).  According to many measures, without a college degree lifetime earnings are much less.  So, the equation should be about money per year while active, and will that be enough to carry a player through the rest of their lives.  Of course, a player could go back to school after retirement."""
"I am fascinated with the topics of Economics, watching the first video has increased my interest in finishing this course."
Very well analyzed. I guess the injury part would be an additional risk factor that can be counted in by a more complex model.
"When NBA restrict their players to graduate college only, it can assure a higher level of quality (in intellectual matters) of their players. The opportunity cost would be the large period of time it would take to have the players entering the league."
What is the pay for college graduates vs pay for college graduates? Are their qualitative and quantitative interests and abilities the players have that makes joinh the NBA a practical alternative?

Hey everybody:

"Yes, I agree. The NBA needs the players asap. And what good do players get if they are going to college not to pursue an education but only to fulfill the NBA's requirement? How focused will they be in classes if what they really are pursuing is basketball? Perhaps, a program that encourages the players to pursue an education after they retire would be better. You don't have to be 18 to go college."
"The advantage in playing in the NBA sooner offers more potential years of income, which could offset the cost of college if the retired player decided to finish the education; the opportunity cost of passing on an NBA salary and also paying for college (in the event of no scholarship) is higher than the cost of college. One years NBA salary could essentially pay for four years of college, even at an Ivy League school."
Only a few successful NBA players will reap the opportunity cost of leaving college early to hit a big paycheck of the NBA over x number of years. Most other players will not make the NBA or have un impressive careers. In this case the opportunity cost of future earnings with a college degree would out way leaving college early.
Explanations for change in income distribution listed in the article:
"While a college education might have long-term benefits in terms of finding a stable job, a solid career in the NBA will yield greater short-term gains. If the player is confident in their basketball skills, it makes sense to make that trade despite the opportunity cost of not attending college on schedule."
"*The Economist* article \For richer, for poorer\"" provides a few explanations for rising income inequality within countries. As entrepreneurship and incentives are promoted effectively within a nation, income inequality may simply reflect economic growth and the rise of those who take good advantage of the system. The key policy recommendations suggested are to boost competition, free cronyist policies, and rather than focus on equality of wealth, a focus on equality of opportunity. One example provided was that of Brazil, whose high income inequality was mitigated through a focus on education and transfers with conditions attached. I agree most with the policy recommendation of providing equality of opportunity. While the government cannot ensure that each individual citizen maximizes their potential, they can ensure that each citizen receives access to the same resources that gives them the opportunity to maximize potential. Examples of equality of opportunity include education, as the article suggests, and a general diversion of funds from the elderly to the young. This reflects an investment in the economy that will bring back benefits."""
"Hey well conceived ideas though, but i really doubt the probabilistic figures that you have put. Your idea of one out of ten players making it big in life and others having a cold career seems uncertain. A basketball team contains a minimum of ten players and a maximum of fifteen. So i feel success rate should be higher."
It has not worked and has not brought any economical benefit to the society rather it has brought disharmony in the society as they landlords starts evicting the people who sticks to the rent control policy.

"I think they meet somewhere in the middle. It seems illogical to produce more when the demand is low, but firms prefer high added value products. There are other instruments at their disposal to produce shifts, like advertising, education (the demand for more quality goods), etc."
"If the country has enough opportunities available in taking NBA as serious career choice, then it will make sense to get started into this right after High School (No need of college). But on the contrary, it would be better to complete graduate school so that the unsuccessful players will be equipped to do earning from something other than NBA."
Thanks for your suggestion :). You are right considering the team-size. 
Firstly from economic perspective so many players make such kind of choice to drop out could be that after studying for an year they know exactly what the opportunity cost is for giving up graduate school. Thus if they are highly motivated and talented to pursue playing basketball the opportunity cost of giving up education is low and that too at a stage when they actually haven't received a degree. After graduating the opportunity cost increases (as now you have a degree!) and thus becomes hard to make choice. In this view I would go for removing restriction of one year of graduate school.

"I believe that for some students who want to become professional basketball players, the opportunity cost of not joining the NBA and remain in college would be too high. If the average salary for a rookie in NBA is about 700.000 to 1.000.000 $, then there is a huge gap between the cost of remainin at college and the profit made by joining the league."
Politicians live on getting votes and the concept of affordable housing makes them seem inclusive and compassionate yet the unintended consequences of a law mandating more houses to be produced at lower prices could houses being produced cheaply and with low-quality and/or the landlord provides less services or landlords getting less money resulting in more evictions cause landlords can't pay their bills.

There are two components lacking in this discussion.  The speed at which we are now able to exchange LARGE amounts of information and our ability to make decision/act based on information from infinite sources. I see a direct correlation between the onset of nearly instant access to information and the most recent market failures. As in all successes or failures the parts are many.
Technology is a resource.
"I think the restriction works for NBA as well, not just from macro perspective. After exploring other possibilities, if a player still decide to continue his sports career, he will be much determined and the drop-out rate will reduce. Since training a player will consume lots of money and resources(assuming a player could drop out without paying some kind of fine), the ristriction can reduce the lost significantly."
"In my opinion, for both the players and the economy increasing the limit to 2 years for example would be better. In this case the opportunity cost for the players choosing the NBA after 2 years in graduate school would be higher, while they compare the opportunity to play for a few years to having a degree that would guarantee a job for life. In this case only players with high qualifications would risk their degree to playing for NBA."
"Since the question posed, as I interpret it, is the opportunity cost regarding the rule itself the cost burden would be to the NBA."
"I believe the restriction should be increased to two years removed requiring players to have a minimum AA. With that in mind students do have the opportunity to complete college courses in high school which can reduce the average time necessary to graduate with an Associates degree therefore decreasing the opportunity cost which would be the NBA salary, drastically if the student pursues that route by graduating with an Associates degree in one year then earning the professional athlete salary with NBA. I feel that all players should be required to complete an Associates degree to better position themselves in the future as no athlete has a guaranteed career.  At least with a two year degree they will have some exposure to college level academics.  This two year plan would increase the opportunity cost by not earning the professional athlete salary and also having to pay for the education. Take into consideration the potential increasing opportunity costs by specializing not only as an athlete but also academically which therefore would diminish the opportunity cost all together over a period time."
"Rent control is used as a public policy tool to **ensure that rent prices don't get too high**. Governments use it to protect the renter, so that landlords can't increase prices that make living impossible. However, this usually leads to a **shortage** of available housing, apartments, etc. "

The article also describes how newer economies, such as South Africa, are inherently more unfair than more established economies.  In America, Beddoes argues that many of the top politicians were not motivated to end the growing disparity between the rich and the poor since it seemed to be benefitting almost everyone.  This changed, however, after the crash, and politicans' reluctance to equalize the income can be seen as a root reason why the income distribution has grown.  The article lastly mentions that governmental policy plays a large role in the growing income disparity amongst the uneducated and the educated. "
"since the opportunity cost of going to college while you could be playing at NBA is so great is reasonable that many students drop college to play basketball, the best thing to do in that case is to allow the students to go to college within a certain period of time after finishing college (say 6 years) so even if they don't succed in basketball they can go back on their decision."
for price the syntax is .XX
"I made the same mistake on the quiz, thinking that a decrease in the price of sugar would complement an increasing demand on the part of consumers for tea, shifting the entire curve to the right. However, the explanation seems to imply that since sugar is necessary in the production of tea, a decrease in the price of sugar means a decrease in the price of tea, which is a movement along the curve."
so excited to recieve a lecture in economics from stanford.
"I think players should be allowed to enter the NBA after high school graduation. While the opportunity cost for the player is the future earnings he may receive with a college degree and a professional career. However, he weighs this against his NBA earning plus sponsorship deals, future coaching/training salaries etc... A persons can return to college at anytime, so the degree itself is not the opportunity costs."
I once had a philosophy course at my university that basically taught that Economics was utilized by priests to their own benefits. 
"the article offers both positive and normative economic explanations. It reflects the history of inequality and its trends since the industrialization and offers possible reasons for this growing trend of inequality. the author believes that cronyism, market and government failures are the main culprits. I agree withe the key recommendations. For China, the government's determination to fight corruption will ultimately narrow the gap between the rich and the poor because fighting corruption is the key to improving equality of opportunity."

My Name is Samuel, I have a Bachelors in Production Engineering and currently doing a further A.Diploma in Mechanical Designs. I do look forward to doing a global business hence my taking this course to better understand how the Economy and the World of Business works."
"In order to evaluate the opportunity cost, one must have knowledge of his opportunities. Its a good rule since the player gets to appreciate both of his/her opportunities in order to better evaluate the costs and make a more informed decision."
"Hello I'm Cyril, a french student currently living in Mexico. Hope to learn a lot with this course !"
"As per the opportunity cost, This is good enough limit..Just missing 1 Yr College basketball is reasonable opportunity cost to get the college degree with good grades and after college , They still gets the chance to play for NBA"

Hello everybody!
Econ.Notes.2B - Observing and Explaining the Economy
"When NBA player is making choice, they should consider the opportunity cost. The value of studying for one year is higher than its opportunity cost, which is going to playing basketball. They can learn many important things in that year, which will have incredible value for their future. But the opportunity cost of staying in the college for four year is too high, because they can earn a lot and increasing their influence in NBA in the other three years. As a basketball player, they only need the basic knowledge, but they don¡¯t need to spend too much time to compete with the other college students."

Anja. This is cheating. not fair.LOL
"The rule that players are required to be 1 year removed from high school before entering the draft provides the wrong incentives and provides for massive structural deficiencies. It also makes the NCAA basketball program (ie., Kentucky) a joke of what a \student athlete\"" means. I believe that this rule should be either totally eliminated altogether, as it really serves no purpose except for 1 year wonders and national championship from \""rented players\"", or the incentive structure changed to make being a student athlete competitive with the alternative. "
Me too suffering the same
You should type number instead of sentence for those questions.
"I do not believe that any government, no matter what fiscal policy it follows, can make inequality dissapear. However, what the Scandinavian example offers us as a model of policy-making against inequality, is the preeminence of education-policy in fighting inequality. In Sweden, Norway, and mainly in Finland, economic disparities are very low, because the access to all levels of education is very high. From the first year in elementary school till University graduation, the people are provided by the State all the necessary means, tools, motivation to become an educated citizen. Thus, the more educated people live in an organised society, the higher the standards of social and economic perfomance, and the lower the social and economic disparities."
Thank you for a great and motivating Welcome video.
"If it was due to education, why do we find founders of Facebook, Microsoft, Apple not following this model ?"
Helloo!
"The article from the Economist agrees that education is a driver for widening income gap, yet the bigger driver is government policy. "
"Yes, I think what you said captures the idea well.  So is there a field of \psycho-economics\"" or \""socio-economics\"" that attempts to create models to predict things like opportunity cost using non-monetary metrics?"""
Pl see the course info as detailed.
"We are asked to consider three scenarios, in which players can enter the NBA:"
"Many players probably drop out of college after one year because the opportunity cost associated with 3 years of NBA play is much larger than the perceived value of a college education.  Dropping the restriction would allow those players to avoid the opportunity cost of an additional year of play, which is probably much greater than the value of a single year of college.  This assumes that they could command the same salary in the NBA based only on their high school play that could command with an additional year of college play."
its so important to knowe the difference between movements and shifts of demand and supply curve and iam so iam so interesting to know the difference btween them
"Hi from the US.  I am a mother, a college graduate from 1979 (yes long ago).  As we age it is important to continue our education, this course is to deepen my understanding and to keep my brain exercised."

"Ratnaditya, yes, what we care about is not debt but the debt to GDP ratio"
I believe NBA should require potential recruits to finish college and graduate before they would be eligible. My reasoning is that of all the college basketball players only a few will be stars and become millionaires for the lost opportunity cost is then very high. Majority of tHEM may washout in the process and and at least with a college education they can pursue other careers and opportunities and have a more satisfying life.
"This is a good insight, I had the same question.  One can imagine technologies, when adopted, that make employees more productive and/or lower production costs (computers, robots, etc.).  One can also imagine technologies, such as those mandated by government through regulations (i.e. coal scrubbers for cleaner air emissions at coal burning plants), that add costs, at least in the short term."
"Since a player can make so much more money playing basketball than at a college educated job, from an economic viewpoint the player should ditch college after the one year and go pro. That's a pretty simple analysis because to take in all the other factors (ranking after playing in college more years, possibility of injury, job market at time of graduation or time of injury, college major, etc.) makes the analysis too complicated."
Opportunity cost involves choosing the next best alternative when an economic decision is being made.

Hey follow the link and you get the required article. you may read other articles as per your interest.
NBA should drop the restrictions for the good of the aspiring players as there is no point in compelling a man to enter 1st year of college and end up wasting 1 year of tuition fee and time.
Case 1. Requiring at least a year after high school graduation
"The NBA should require players to graduate college before entering the draft. In the current system there is an opportunity cost to the players because they forgo a 'backup plan' for an alternative career if the NBA career doesn't pan out, as well as the costs and work associated with applying to a college, moving to campus, taking classes (for a degree that won't be completed), time invested in the program all for just one year of experience rather than four. The opportunity cost to college sports is with the high turnover rate of athletes, more time and money has to be spent on recruiting more high school players to rebuild the program more often. Colleges are investing a significant amount of money in terms of scholarship but getting limited returns for just one year rather than four. The quality of the college game also suffers because instead of many veteran-laden teams, there are more 'freshman phenoms' that steal the stage for one year with highlight reels but may not produce the best quality basketball product. Allowing players to leave after one year also floods the NBA with too many young players trying to join faster than older, established players are retiring, making it more difficult for the youngsters to break into stardom and further increasing the opportunity cost of getting a college degree."
"I like your anwser, it's really in full perspective and detailed."
"Most players satisfy the bare minimum and drop out immediately after simply because the additional years wasted in college doesn't justify the additional training, exposure and salary gained. Since the player has already chosen his field of trade, he might as well get another year's head start because 1 year of school isn't going to help him get any better at the sport."
"The NBA should require players to graduate college before entering.  The easily-apparent opportunity cost to players is the loss of three years' significant income while in college, which would probably prove so tempting that it would cause many players to drop out. Less apparent is the opportunity cost of missing college, which would be more hidden and variable depending on injury and skill of the player.  While players might think they could always return to school and pick up where they started, this would be more emotionally difficult once they are older, and it might be a plan never realized, leading not only to financial costs, but cost in personal fulfillment as well.  Returning to school later would also mean missing out on \the college experience\"" and all that it brings to one's psyche and memory, since an adult going to college does not experience the camaraderie and group experience a recent high school grad does."""
"Indeed, in past few years in my country, the widening o gaps of income had been very alarming.  The rich is getting richer, and lot of them were employed by the government."
"Hi! My name is A<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>a, and I'm from the Philippines. I graduated with a degree in International Relations and managed to end up working in a PR/marketing firm.

"Took the players this decision because the profit attributable them from playing and left the study and function much more than the job function, study, and this, according to the theory of alternative opportunities and the value of the opportunity and the opportunity cost can be overcome this situation that requires National Basketball Association, the U.S. plays a player four years with the University to complete his studies supported budget compensated for lost earnings from playing in the competition"
"Hi All,  "
"I don`t know if we have a perfect correlation here...For example, if I`m a tea consumer and I find out that the price of sugar is up, I would explore other options...I can change my behavior and drink my tea without sugar or I can find a cheaper substitute...If the price of sugar is down I don`t think that we could have a great demand on the tea market...Maybe it could be a minor influence, but it depends of many factors (mainly the consumer behavior...for example in England would have a greater impact than in Romania, where we have tea just for breakfast and we use the plants that we find in our garden :))"
"It's obvious that many basketball players would make this decision based solely on the concept that they are pretty much guaranteed to make way more money in the NBA than going through college and running the risk of not getting a good job after. The year restriction is a good theoretical idea, though, so that the players have time to figure out what they want to do. High school kids don't know what is in their best interest, so a year in college could give them a little more insight into what they want to do with their futures."
"I agree. I thought of sugar as a complementary product to tea as well---hence, a shift, rather than a movement in the demand curve. I'd rather enjoy my tea without sugar, thanks."
"As the article points out, San Francisco booming with high-income tech industry workers and has much more demand for housing than it can supply. The reason also is because of these high-income tech workers the rent is very high. As the demand continuous to grow they need to find a solution for housing. "
"Assumption- entry into NBA is guaranteed either after one year of high school or immediately after high school. If restriction of one year is removed, then no opportunity cost lost. However, if limit is increased to graduate college, opportunity cost will be calculated basis expected salary after graduation vis-a-vis expected earnings for playing for NBA."
"both the player and the NBA have their respective opportunity cost , playing directly after finishing high school or even while in a high school ,it will be highly profitable for both NBA and to the player."
"Currently, players probably go into the NBA after one year of college due to financial incentives, better coaching, and more time focused on basketball. The opportunity cost of staying in college is the salary and additional perks that would result from playing pro basketball. Removing the one-years restriction may lead to fewer basketball players attending college at all, but requiring a longer waiting period after high school or a college degree to play in the NBA doesn't make much sense... Keeping the one-year limit may encourage basketball players to attend college, and even finish a degree, as the opportunity cost of going into the NBA after one year would be not having a college degree to fall back on."
"Wow...highly diverse group. I am Joseph from Nigeria. I have a MSc Petroleum Geoscience from Institut Francais de Petrole (IFP), France. I currently work as a Geophysicist in Lagos. This course is a check to validate my interest in Economics and an opportunity to learn from Stanford University."
The reason potential players choose to end their college career and enter the NBA is because they view the opportunity cost of not playing in the NBA to be higher than the opportunity cost of going to college i.e.
"I am enjoying this discussion! Everyone recognizes the key concept of opportunity cost and applies it in the answer.  You might be interested to know that one of Stanford¡¯s varsity basketball players this year, Robbie Lemons, wrote an excellent economic honors thesis on the relationship between college sports and professional sports. His thesis has a proposal which would change the opportunity cost that you are all addressing. He proposed that colleges adopt (1) the ¡°Olympic Model¡± in which athletes can receive compensation (not from their college) for other sports related activities while in college and (2) a student-athletes¡¯ Bill of Rights, which would include: ¡°a) Right to transfer schools without penalty, b) Right to a four-year scholarship guarantee, c) If an athlete competes for a college for three or more years, then he should receive an open-ended scholarship until graduation, d) Right of athletes to be treated like other students _ freedom of speech, privacy rights, fair redress of grievances, protection from physical/mental abuse, e) Right to consult with agents, f) Right to endorsement revenue.¡±"

"Even though rent control is economically inefficient, it is still used as a public policy tool because it gives people with power, i.e. the landlords, the ability to evict residences and turn those properties into condos which they can use to make more money. If a price ceiling were instated, it would solve the problem but it could hurt business because it decreases competitiveness of prices so the consumers don't get as much of a range of prices."
"One question we will want to address in this course is what is the best way to attack cronyism.  Cronyism frequently arises when government regulators give favors or special rights to some people, in many cases in the firms that they regulate.  This is sometimes called regulatory capture.  So how do you reduce regulatory capture? In some cases more reliance on markets may reduce the problem.  Look for this coming up in a couple of weeks."
Thanks a lot Mgirl!
Wikipeda suggests Price Ceilings => Shortages
"The article suggests the source of the growing gap between rich and poor within a specific nation or area reflected unfairness in the system¡¯s access to economic opportunities. In addition to unequal educational opportunities the author points to the disparity of governmental policies favoring large corporations and financial institutions over middle and lower class workers. While shifting policies to favor the middle class and providing more equitable access to higher education I believe, particularly for the long established industrial world leaders, among them the USA, it is imperative to invest more assets and support to the infrastructure and development of new technologies."
"For the students is most lucrative play for the NBA than study in college, because in the most of the cases playing for the NBA represents more salary and fame than a university carrer, so, the opportunity cost of give up their carrers is lower than play basketball."
"The concept of opportunity cost tells us what we could have done if we had not made a desicion, in economic terms it tells us how we could have won or lost to follow one path or another. "

"Because simply it is way more rewarding (financially &  personally)  to be an NBA player, than a college graduate."
"progress together ^_^ i'm a junior student from China,sorry,My English is poor,Where are you from?"
"The article points out corruption, cronyism, entrenched elites, etc. as part of the causes that are rising inequality within states, emerging markets and developed economies alike."
"The players should be allowed to enter NBA immediately because they would lose 1 year of the prime period in their life , a time that could have been used to earn more money and further develop their skills. After that 1 year, the law of diminishing returns may set in."
The enrollment fee for the college must be huge and total opportunity cost for so many of these players must be immense to actually make a difference in national economy. Instead if measures are taken such that NBA giving scholarships to players having good skills to complete their college degrees or just that first year would be a lot better option.
In a normal circumstance macroeconomics should add up to what the macroeconomics reflect but again if macroeconomic of depending region or the world changes abruptly it may affect the microeconomics. That is my understanding right now.
"Hi,"
"The opportunity cost needs to be considered from both points of view. In the case of LeBron James and some others the rule was not enforced because the opportunity cost of enforcing it was huge for both the NBA and James. Enforcing the rule in the normal case is important for the NBA because you just don't know how good a player is going to be until he has played in a bigger group. For the player, he most likely would not want the rule enforced, but extending the time more puts the player at risk of a higher opportunity cost due to the risk of injury."
"I disagree.  I believe the limit should increases to require athletes to complete 4 years of college.  Barring any injuries or unforeseen circumstances, most NBA players have a very short professional career (I don't have the statistics to back up my assertion).  Even for the more successful NBA players, they have somewhere between 10-15 years in the league.  We also have heard many stories of professional athletes squandered away their fortunes due to some very poor financial decisions.  Most players retired from basketball in their mid-30s. They still have around 40-50 years left to live.  What are they going to do after the NBA?"
"The economic explanations that are offered in the article show the disparity in income distribution among the higher and lower tiers of society. This is attributed to a few reasons mainly the changes in the return to education. Also, capital gains from the stock market, mortgages and other financial investments lead to the wider gap among the groups. Cronyism is another factor leading to this disparity in income distribution - and the frustration of many lower income groups. "
"I think the restriction should be dropped, allowing the players have the free will to make a choice based on their comparative advantage to either join the NBA immediately, make their money and continue their education later or go to college, where they can continue playing, anyway, to hone their skills while earning their degree and move into professional NBA afterwards. It all depends on the individual and the comparative advantage they think they have that may help them in envisaging the cost they incur in making a choice."
Thanks David.

Dear Sir
"I notice that whenever there is debate about minimum wage increase, we only focus on the supply side of the debate.  We only discuss how the minimum wage would lead to high unemployment because the costs of production increase.  Firms would reduce production.  As a result we would see higher prices at lower quantity.  But what about demand?  When employees earn more money, they have more to spend.  The demand curve will shift outward.  The equilibrium will be at a higher price level and higher quantity.  In order for firms to produce more they would have to hire more workers.  The measurement should be whether the new higher cause by rising demand is equal to the loss of labor due to higher costs.  "
"Many players may drop out of college to play in the NBA because the opportunity costs to finish their degree first, i.e. the lost rewards for playing in the NBA two or three years earlier, seem to be to high to them. However, the opportunity costs of having generations of NBA players who drop out of the NBA at the end of their career WITH a college degree are probably much higher. Therefore it would be better to have the players finish college first, if they already show the potential for college in the first place. I like the idea of scholarships for these players/students to encourage them to finish their degree first."
"I think that NBA players choose to pursue a professional career rather than focusing on college is because the opportunity cost of being an NBA player is higher especially if they have a passion for playing, it means that they won't need to work harder, instead, they will enjoy themselves. Not only the money they earn is great, the fame and glory is great too. Add the passion to it, then I think that being an NBA player can be a good of a deal."
"I think that restriction should be drop out altogether.. For professional players one year sometimes might mean loosing a chance to succeed. Most of the time starting sport career at a younger age helps a lot, because physically you would be more fit to do good in sports, as you get older chances of being successful in sports are declining. therefore, loosing years at college might ruin that person's career. You could always start studying after you finish your sport career. Just like some NBA players, O'Neal for example."
"Many players may choose to play one year of basketball at college and then drop out of college to enter the NBA because to them the opportunity cost of both staying in college to finish their degree and of not entering college at all, is higher than entering college for one year only. A key factor in their decision to enter college could be that their ability to enter the NBA is uncertain at that stage, and entering college (given that they have the financial and intellectual capability to do so) offers an opportunity to continue to play basketball, whilst providing the back-up of the opportunity to complete a degree if they are not able to join the NBA. To them, perhaps, the opportunity cost of staying in college to complete a degree if they have the option to enter the NBA is too high because the immediate financial rewards of NBA will be greater, the need to study lower and the time spent doing something they love to do, higher. "
Type only numbers and nothing else.
"Many players made this decision because they think that playing in NBA is worthier than finishing college. In my opinion, the opportunity cost of a athletic life is very high: they have to take a lot of risks in order to be a successful athlete and the return of their investments might be lower than expected. Because of that, dropping the restriction would let futures athletes feel free to think about professional life even before starting college. Furthermore, "
Hi everyone my name is Saskya and I am from Quito Ecuador..... I have a bachelor in Finance ....I am so excited to recieve this course... best regards... :)
As mentioned earlier Many great entrepreneurs took a similar decision because they knew the value of starting their goals or dream sooner than later. time is essential in sports just like inventions. the longer you wait to start to play into the NBA could decrease the chances of a player to be at his prime and shine. I believe that time is the O.C here. Most player will choose to get into the NBA first because of the instant gratification. Players will make more money quicker and also know that they can start school at a later time. Dropping the restriction will be also my choice.

"Most of the article analyzes the issues, and the policy recommendations are brief and not thoroughly explained.  I would need to see more statistics on age and income to know whether the age-related policies make sense."
"Rent Control is an infrigement on Property Rights, typically with Government, they want to eat their cake and have it. "
"The opportunity cost of going to college for an outstanding athlete is very high - Not only is the college tuition ridiculously expensive, but especially if he knows that he's good enough for the NBA (of course, minus any of his ego and over-evaluating his skills), he also can \waste\"" a year getting used to the college basketball environment, only to realize that he'll be out soon to be in the NBA, which means he'll need more time getting used to the new environment. That'd at least be about 2 years of adjusting to different environment and spending a lot of time \""following the rules\"" when the player can hone his skills further during the time to make himself much more marketable!"""
"Though rent control is economically inefficient in that it has a similar effect as putting a ceiling price on a good (rental prices that could be higher if they were at market equilibrium price), it is still used as a public policy tool to protect lower income workers from being evicted from their rental homes. Rent control could also inadvertently hurt lower income renters because it can create housing shortages (since low income tenants are not forced out in this case even though a buyer may be willing to pay more than the current tenants). Another issue with rent control is that it can decrease the quality of living, as the landlords have no incentive to improve an apartment for which they can't increase the price."
"As the article says, the democratization has lead to a greater gap, as the regular middle-class citizen didn't mind so much if the richest was getting richer as long as he/she could afford a nice house, a car, TV, holidays, and so on."
Macroeconomics has higher disagreement than microeconomics because; majority of them are the elite and leaders of the country.
"The article provided little information regarding rent control as a public policy tool. The little that was mentioned centered around past legislative battles which people would covet and not want to go through again, and the ideological nature of rent control which people will often keep in place if they feel it is right, despite inefficiencies."
Seems like most of us agree.
"Sure, from an opportunity cost perspective it is more lucrative to immediately enter the NBA.  But the individual will be foregoing the college education which has other - not just monetary - rewards.  An NBA career can be cut short for any number of reasons, and taking a slow and steady approach may pay huge dividends for the individual in the long run.  "
I cant wait to understand how the price floors and price ceiling work in view of the so called free market.
"Just like all the price controls, rent control does not offer  any win-win situations to both the landlords and the tenants. It can never be used as a public policy tool because of its win-lose situations and most of the time favoring the landlords."
"Hi, I just want to share my experience regarding the supply and demand model and ask what you think about my answer."
"In this example, going to play in the NBA results in the least opportunity cost.  The window of opportunity to play a pro sport is limited compared to the window to go to college.  If the individual takes the opportunity to play in the NBA and it does not work out, he can always go back to college.  The reverse scenario may not be possible because he may be past his physical prime to play after college."
"The article speaks of a direct relationship between the academic degree attained and salary. Recommended to increase the educational level of the population, in  my opinion the problem forget basic points as: the type of government, the type of community, gender inequality, technological level, and many other things."
They make this decision given the high salaries paid in the NBA and their desire to become celebrities.
Thanks a lot for your help Srishti15 and Sam! I also saw the clockes and I neither know its meaning. I didn't find anything related to the quizzes in the course structure.
There are several variables that would affect the opportunities cost to the player
From Wikipedia:
"I think I understand the theory of the PPC but I'm not sure how it is possible in practice to determine all the points on any given curve comparing two choices (e.g. movies vs computers). In a real-life situation it is generally impractical to perform a controlled experiment that would allow the complete curve to be drawn. Given this difficulty I imagine that it will only be possible to vary parameters in such a way as to allow only some part of the curve to be plotted. It may be that this approach can yield some real insight into the likely increase in opportunity cost that would arise if the variation on each axis was increased, but at best this can only be an approximation and as such must come with some significant risk of error."
"The debate is endless and in difficult situations where significant hardship is felt by people, silence by the Governments is not practical. Simultaneously, the limits on wealth generation cannot be permitted at the expense of people who worked hard, took risks to create infrastructure that could enable further economic growth."
Now I get it! Guess I was initially confused by terminologies- demand vs quantity demanded and same with supply.
Economic Explanations: 
"How trends and patterns, intelligently distinguish among citizenship of inequality. Which keeps humanity more analytically civilized. Scaling between micro economics and macro economics worth individual and global transformation for betterment of life! Make government policy with implementation, and proper time constraint feedback."
"Controversially in 2005, NBA commissioner David Stern stated that \too many young urban Americans incorrectly saw the NBA as a sure path to fame and financial security.\"" And that the 'one year out of college rule' results from \""the need to see players perform against higher competition before they are evaluated for valuable draft picks.\"""
"I watch the lectures during commute, for now I have to click through individual videos and download each of them."
"Only for subscribers. Can't do, sorry."
"When considering whether the NBA should remove their rule banning immediate high school graduates from participating in the league, one might think that the question comes down to whether the educational attainment of players is more important than their potential economic earnings in the years they would spend in school. However, for the NBA, there are other factors at play. "
"The article linked (I did not pay for access to the full article series) listed several explanations for increasing the disparity of the distribution of wealth in the world population. The industrial peak and plateau, shift of governmental focus during the \Go-Go\"" years, a plutocratic atmosphere, social issues of the poor and a growing resentment amongst the lower income population leading to apathy were those I noted."
"The article dismisses out of hand higher taxes and more social security ('handouts') - revealing gross ideological bias and refusing to consider policy options that can in fact have a great impact on inequality. The last 30 years have seen a reversal in the kind of progressive taxation policies that predominated before - and moreover corporate wealth and super-rich individuals are increasingly able to escape taxation through stashing their money in secrecy jurisdictions. Reintroducing progressive taxation policies (rather than relying on regressive consumption taxes) and tackling tax abuse could do much to improve equality. There is also plenty of evidence that welfare spending (social protection/security) can help to prevent extreme inequality.

"It is very different that happens in my country, our reality between basketball and college is different, but for the USA reality, I can say that the fact about the player go out the college is just for one reason, they saw a great cost opportunity out of the college playing basketball, normally the NBA pays a lot and a normal career after a college degree don't pay as a NBA Star, and also i think that those kind of players normally don't have a profile for college life. They just found their way or their \Cost Opportunity!."""
The opportunity cost for a player who can not enter the NBA until after one year of graduation is the salary would win in a year in the NBA. If two years so will be two NBA salaries. 
"Well, from what I've learnt during this course thus far, it obviously would be more beneficial for students and the NBA to drop this restriction and allow players to enter the NBA immediately after graduating high school if most of the students ultimately choose to leave college career to enter the NBA. The opportunity cost of graduating college and then joining to NBA is the money,time, skills and fame the students would have earned if they were playing in the professional basketball league during that time. In fact, NBA players are considered the world's best paid sportsmen, by average annual salary per player."
"Rent control has been used to protect tenants from landlords and investors looking to turnover renters and potentially sell their investments (in this case property) at higher prices.  In San Francisco's case, breaking the rent control policy will help landowners and landlords provide an incentive to investors to buy more apartments and condos, turning over the property into my affluent hands.  This would potentially increase property value as well. "
"In my opinion, the best option is to drop this restriction altogether (allowing players to enter the NBA immediately after graduating high school) rather than increasing the limit. No NBA basketball players need a college degree to play better. Instead the priority is the physical condition. As everyone knows, the best age to basketball players is between 16 and 30 years. Therefore, every year in college means one year of lost income, being made to graduate from college equals to three years of lost income so from an individual point of view, being able to join NBA straight after high school would be preferable. If their desired career is basketball, the year in college could be viewed as wasted time."
"Lack of college education of founders of Facebook, Microsoft, Apple etc. can't be used to counter the argument that education might be one of the possible causes of income gap between rich and poor. In fact, the example only advances the argument: the individuals you referred to are extraordinarily gifted people who pursued their novel ideas, which had tremendous future economic utility, and they pursued the idea with the help of highly educated college graduates, creating shared wealth for everyone involved with their enterprise. After all, founder of facebook may be a college dropout but people who work for this company are not."

"While people with a higher education get a higher salary overall. We now live in a economy where you may not get a job from over education and a inability to pay a wage equal to education. I also think that college no longer guarantees a well paying job, if even a job at all. I am pursuing education because I enjoy it not because I think I will make more money from it."
"I agree with you 100%. The reason we are here is because our politicians continue to gain money from lobbyist. Those politicians make money off allowing companies to sell products to consumers that no longer have jobs because of laws such as the North American Trade act. If politicians got paid less, there children would have to go to public schools, they would have to live the hard life. They would understand what living and having loans and student debt really is.

"Rent control exists to give lower income individuals access to housing. There isn't enough housing to fulfill everyone's needs, and as the article says, in San Francisco it's in a landlord's best interest to court richer people from the tech industry. Even though it's economically inefficient, equal access to housing is the underlying intention. Admittedly though, this can result in a depreciation of housing quality since under this regulation landlords have less financial incentive to maintain their properties."
"The opportunity cost is defined as the most valuable thing which cannot be done as a result of doing something else. But in skipping college, the players have chosen their career in NBA for not just one, but many important things that only colleges can provide them with. For example, the players have lost the chance of being an independent learner and thinker. They have forgone the chance to read Nietzsche, to do physics, and to learn more about themselves and the world before entering the world of selfish interest known as professional sports. Since the greatest NBA players are often treated as role models for the youths in this country, it makes sense for them to become worthy role models before they become great basketball players. Only through formal education in college  can they become an inspiration, just think of players like Tim Duncan. Therefore, I'd make the case for imposing the limit to require players to finish college before becoming the professional player."
"There are definitely a few flaws in the recording of answers.  I too have experienced getting an \X\"" when the correct answer was given."""
"Hi,"
I think it depends on the player's own understanding about his skills. If he is really very good at basketball then he can forego his college or else he must continue with the college as his career. NBA can have a selection test and advice players whether to go for basket ball or college depending on their abilities. This will make efficient use of the talent in the country.

"My own theory is that the relative equality of incomes in the 1980s was a result of the cold war. The ideological fight with communism forced capitalism to be more humane than it normally is.

They should drop the restriction so that the players will not need to wait for another year just to join. This save the college costs and also save a college placing for prospective students who really wanted to enter that particular course that the player applied for.
I think it is best for them to retain the current rule. If they went to play straight away they would never comprehend the opportunity cost. With a years college experience they can gauge the opportunity cost and make a better informed decision.
"fascinating point!!! seems to me that it's due to fundamental philosophical shift where governments are outsourcing more of the infrastructure development, and running of normally run government operations  to private enterprises.

And as the governments are getting poorer, they are selling and outsourcing even more than before, thus setting up a sort of a positive feedback loop.  "
You supposed right - a fall in consumers' income creates a shift in the demand curve. I hope you got this answer right.
Getting a college degree has an opportunity cost of given up salary plus tuition cost. Current policy requires a person giving up a yearly NBA salary anyway so that some of them decide to go to college as their best choice. 
"It does not make economic sense for the NBA to have the one year rule for the players. With a really talented player, NBA could make money via sponsorship during that one year rather than putting a restriction of requiring the player to be one year removed from high school. There is no gain for the NBA (nor for the players) by having the one year rule."

"Rent Control can be used as a public policy tool because people can easily support it. Most people will hear that the law will simply \make rent cheaper,\"" without thinking of the secondary consequences. In reality, reducing the price ceiling to below the equilibrium price will cause there to be more buyers demanding apartments than there are apartments; in other words, rent control would cause a shortage in apartments, hurting the very people that it tries to help."""

"Google has decided to provide the customers with 100GB of cloud storage for US$1.99 a month, with 1TB costing  US$9.99 a month.  The demand curve for the customers decreases rapidly, for the most important files like photos, documents and other things are just small files, which would not occupy too much. So most people would choose the 100 GB plan, which the customer surplus is large and the marginal benefit is high. For those guys choose the 1 TB plan, actually the marginal benefits is low, but most of them would not use so much room. Because the upload of  large files like blue ray movies would be slow due to the bandwidth. So the strategy of Google on the cloud storage is quite reasonable."
"I agree with this notion. There are too many variables that could potentially derail a pro career. If an attempt at the pros fails,then what. Tiger succeeded as did a few others.

"Take San Francisco for example. Rent control has gotten out of control. Originally, the policy was seen as beneficial, halting prices in the face of [a spike in inflation in 1979][1]. In recent years, the influx of well-paid tech professionals to San Francisco incentivizes landlords to evict tenants from rent-controlled apartments under the Ellis Act to convert units to condominiums. Rent control has caused a shortage of housing for, and, as you put it, hurts the people it is supposed to help."

I was confused about this as well. My guess would be that D represents an immediate effect (the supply of bikes can't magically increase overnight while the price of bikes can) and so is preferable over B. In the longer term it would seem necessary for this increased price to drive increasing production until the market's return to the equilibrium point.
"The problem I have with players forgoing the remainder of college to enter the NBA early is the risk factor in not finishing their education. Many people disagree with me and may be of the mindset that a player can finish college later, but do we every consider what happens when a player is injured early in his career? Does he have any other marketable skills? How many NBA players end up bankrupt before they retire and have no education to fall back on for income because they were too young and uneducated in financial planning? Basketball is in no way a long-term career. It is indeed temporary and should be treated as such. The dollars made by an NBA player may start off in the millions, but after they pay taxes, managers, take care of family members, and splurge because they lack discipline, many are shocked to find out they have no money for retirement and because they didn't finish college, have no skills to offer a potential employer."
"A college player may enter the NBA early from an economic perspective to begin his NBA earnings 3 years later. He might consider taking advantage of the guaranteed salary and using his younger legs and avoiding possible injury that could take place while playing college ball. If he's thinking stragtegically, he might consider the possibility of investing, saving, and increasing his retirement accounts. He could also purchase real estate as an investment and use his dollars to invest on other business ventures. But the key will be in his financial planning and understanding of money,because statistically athletes have a very high rate of bankruptcy by the time they retire. I attribute this trend to a lack of maturity and a celebrity-like lifestyle that is unrealistic but sadly, common."
"I believe it has to do with incentive involved in making this choice. Other than weighing the opportunity cost associated with both the choices, someone will make this choice only if there is sufficient incentive to convince him."
"From an economics perspective, the players choose to drop out of college because they think that the opportunity cost of waiting 3 more years to join NBA is higher than the cost of dropping out. Since the players don't seem to be too interested in getting a college education and instead prefer to spend their youth playing basketball, I think the NBA should allow players to enter the NBA immediately after high school.The year that the players are required to spend in college is wasted anyways so they shouldn't be forced to wait to join the NBA."
"It seems to me that \utility\"" is only a concept, an idea, and can't be quantified. We're dealing with tastes which is not numerical, only subjective."""
I believe players graduating high school should be able to pursue their career in the NBA immediately as the opportunity cost of the year spent at college is the salary which could be made in the NBA.
"Hi everybody, I'm from Brazil. I'm an economist and currently work at the University of Brasilia ... Good luck to all."
"For an NBA player, the opportunity cost of entering the league is to give up the chance of getting into college. At first glance, it's a wise choice in terms of the basketball career development; however, when looking at this issue closer, it's not just about going to college, but missing the chance of self-development. In my opinion, it would be proper for NBA to increase the limit, which is to require players to graduate college before entering the NBA. "
"I believe that the situation in the U.S. is much better than in Europe on this issue. We in Europe, have much more politicians who practice this kind of ''controlled'' economy. And I fully understand the situation in San Francisco, People love these populist measures and support them, because they believe it is the way to protect poor. Negative side of this are obvious, firstly, no one will decide to buy a house or apartment, secondly, construction of new houses in less expensive parts of the city is not profitable, and that is exactly possibility for all those people who are less educated and less skilled to get a job."
"Rent Controls are used as a public policy tool because they are a \quick fix\"" and a flash point for the low end of the wealth distribution population. It gives the appearance of positive action since the the very negative results may take years to manifest. Housing is not comsumable like milk but is durable.  With a consumable product shortages and/or surplus and their impact are noticeable in real time.  With durables the negative impact may not been seen for months and often times years. This time factor allows policy makers to avoid responsibility."
I think most of the posts really do not answer the question - why might so many players make this decision?

Great point you have here QinEn. Totally agree with you on this. Keeping the price low of the housing will increase the marginal benefit and we want to keep them equal. This means a loss of economic efficiency that can occur when equilibrium is not Pareto optimal. And losses of taxation.
"I believe that they are fulfilling the requirements of the league, but in whole they see the opportunity cost of playing in the NBA versus getting a college education.

"Overpopulated countries such as China and India will have high income inequality for centuries to come. Because there are just too many people to incorporate productively into the economy. The same is true of most of Africa. In Europe and the US, poverty will mostly reside among undocumented immigrants and ethnic minority that make consistent bad live decisions. Also this is not to says that the corruption in the FIRE sector might not burn down the Western economic house."
"The article mentions important issues related to income distribution. One of the main problems of a unequal income distribution, is when a region have have a big income gap that bar poor people to return to education, in order to increase their incomes a the poor portion needs to prioritize spend their time, working to live, and pay the basic expenditures that anyone can have. The government has a important role to play creating policies to incentive poor people to return to education instead work in the early productive years of a individual, because that I agree with the key policy recommendations."
Google is definitely putting themselves ahead of other companies in the market because by decreasing their prices per unit of cloud storage they have increased the marginal benefit to consumers per unit of cloud storage. The demand is higher at this lower price due to increased marginal benefit to consumers and so other companies will have to decrease their prices too if they want to compete with Google.

"There are several points I would like to emphasize in regards to this case. First of all, many players make a decision to leave college after the first year and enter the league, because the opportunity cost is greater, i.e. the salary they could have been getting if part of the NBA, as opposed to paying for tuition (or not even either paying or gaining anything, if the tuition were zero). Second, I think that dropping restrictions altogether would be more beneficial to players, since they would be getting paid right after high school graduation, without having to wait a year. At the same time, it seems to me that if players went to college and, thus, chosen some other professions, they could have been more productive members of the national economy."
"The opportunity cost is inefficient because the number of people who will be selected to enter play at professional level is very low, and visualizing it on a macro environment the cost to the country is losing competitiveness by allowing x number of people leaving school and stop being productive for the country and are a cost to maintain them, so you must modify the rule that must be professional and always have a second option"

The article suggests an assessment or assumption that consumers may not be willing to pay or see no marginal benefit in buying  storage space below 15 GB or some figure below that.

"The purpose of rent control, as I understand it, are to assure that those with the lowest level of income have rental housing available to them at a price they can afford when there is a shortage in the market. When there is a shortage of housing, people selecting the least expensive options will pay whatever they are able to, as the alternative is to be homeless (low demand elasticity). If the goal is to reduce homelessness, and/or to allow those in the lowest level of income to have some of the  financial opportunities afforded to those at a higher income level (savings, insurance, pensions), then rent control seems a sensible approach. What the article seems to suggest is that in a shortage market with rent control, suppliers (landlords) will, rather than reducing supply, spend money on lawyers and lobbyists in an effort to reach achieve an equilibrium. If unfettered freedom of markets is the ultimate goal, then it is achieved, but if the goal has more to do with freedom of opportunity, the notion that a house is a human right, or the notion that when the lowest on the financial totem thrive, it benefits all, then I would conclude that legislators have failed."
If you raise tax on rich they will take the business else where. The major issue is the waste of the resources and the understanding of each another. This is more evident in emerging economies then in developed countries. Government can not do everything society has to take charge. Education is the key in this regard.

"As stated economists often disagree on macroeconomic issues. My interest in economics has grown since the most recent financial crisis, but what strikes me is that the crisis was not widely forecast by economic theory, or at least if it was then warnings were largely ignored by policy makers.

"The Economist article identifies a number of reasons why income inequality may grow:  increased benefits for the more highly educated, inefficiencies in markets due to cronyism for example the benefits to banks operating in an environment where they are considered \too big to fail\"", slowing growth leading to fiscal policies which damage the poor more than the rich."

"Hi From Domincan Republic. I_m Student bussines administration, and I want to lear economic"
in some ways it would be good to enter right after high school but the higher education is important too. What about the ones that can't afford to go to college?  Going into it right after high school would be a great choice for them.  If the ones dropping out of college after one year received a tution grant I think they should finish the 4 years.  if they know they are going to drop out then the tution grant should go to someone who would like a college education.

with copper prices going so hign they are looking to use aluminium which is much cheaper to use.  i see the demand for copper going down as the demand for aluminium increaes.
While there are negative consequences to rent control in the short run (landlords do not get to make 2x the market value on their property or may decide to invest in fewer properties) there are numerous advantages to rent control that I am surprised people are not addressing.
Ohhhh thank you!
"I feel like the visible hand in the last video was mischaracterized: the usual opposite to a free initiative/free market would be a planified economy where a government would (at least try to) impose production and consumption levels rather than asking nicely or begging, it seems to me. Not arguing in favour of it, for what it's worth, but thought I'd bring the idea up."
So do I! 
"In my opinion, if NBA requires players to graduate college, they would be lose younger players and their energy. Because younger players have good energy and it effects team atmosphere. So I think NBA's opportunity cost is younger players in that case. "
"Immediately after high school, players do not have an alternative to NBA and thus there is no opportunity cost for not going to NBA. By stepping into college for one year, players have an alternative to a career in NBA, thus increasing the net opportunity cost to a player. This would force a player to seriously consider before making a choice of stepping into NBA. In my opinion, one year is too little a time to give a clear visibility of what options might lay ahead if one chooses to continue in college. A 2 yr window and 1 summer internship would be a great way to decide. However, the cost of letting go of that one years worth of income if one decides to join NBA can be too high (money now > same money later)."
In the USA the top 10% earn much more than 90%. The 10% is more educated from  80's? The explain is other!!
"One of the most interesting data available on this article is related to the fallen of the Gini coefficients in Latin American countries over the last years. It is an important data, but should be analyzed with other data."
"I think the new goal of the governments around the world is implement effective policies to give opportunities to people, especially young people. educational opportunities for poor people make a country more fair."
"The explanation given by The Economist seems to be very logical, as it implies that contries like USA or China give more importance to equality of oportunities rather than equality of outcome. As long as this is true, disparities in these countries can be explained because those who choose to get access to education are far better rewarded (profit) than those who don't. In that sense, education takes a strategical position in order to have more profit and the access to it (education) is the top source of economical progress."
only if there is substitution of copper by aluminium.
Just download it and run it using your local media player .. it will work :)
The utility table is a matrix of price and acquired units. I am not a speciallist but I think there should be a mathematical form to estimate it.
"It may hurt the land lords to make them require less payment per month to rent out their houses, but it benefits the economy to do so. Gives workers a place to stay so that they may work efficiently and have intensives to work harder so that they can keep their house. This also gives them more money to spend on other goods, spreading the wealth around much more efficiently."
"Google's price cut in cloud storage affect marginal benefit to increase. The customers will consume more or, in other words, use more cloud storage. To be able to compete with Google, other companies need to reduce their prices as well; otherwise, they will go out of business."
agree. consumers will not pay more even for a bigger quantity. they are satisfied with medium.
'A competitive profit-maximizing firm produces at a quantity such that marginal cost equals the price.' The marginal product is the change in output resulting from a one unit increased. The oil market seems competitive.
"As explained in the article, income inequality would severe in the early stage of industrialization and then relief because of better education and skill training. That encourage innovations in the society. Since fasten industrial revolution reduce the period of income distribution gap, we should encourage technology innovation and patent protection so that economy grows faster and individual income grows faster. And later on, that boost into a virtuous circle of innovation and better education and relive the inequality gap."
"Indeed. And as I said before, if one agrees to pay, why change the price?"
Two different circumstances exist for rental control policy implied as public policy for favoring the majority of the low and moderate income tenants. In San Francisco booming economy is leading to conversion of low- and moderate - income rental properties to refurbishing for expensive apartments affecting the population who could not afford thereby increasing a demand which could stir up crises for accommodation. 
I think the goal of the society could be control of power groups in the political decisions. That is cause of enormous gap of incomes.
I interpret the supply and demand model as a generalization of all actors in the market.

"If NBA increase the limit, NBA will lose youth players and their energy that could increase NBA_s profits...On the other hand, if the players are allowed to enter the NBA immediately after graduating high scool they could lose the opportunity of analyzing the life in college...It would be better for them?"
"The economic explanations referred in the article are very precise in addressing the problems in a theoretical way, and point out ways to diminish the gap between rich and poor, which effectively has happened in Brazil and in Sweden."
"The demand and supply models presented are basic models in economics. The final objective of the economy is to maximize the wellbeing of buyers and sellers. In rent control in San Francisco, a price ceiling, as rent control, will limit the rocketed increase in rent prices triggered by the rapid increase in demand. Supply is a bit inelastic, quantity of apartments does not change fast, there is not much space to develop new projects. And demand is also inelastic, people have to pay rent even if it cost 30% of their income. Governmental intervention is necessary in this non perfect market to maximize the wellbeing of people in San Francisco."

"There is somewhat a general consensus that the current fall in copper prices is linked to an overall marginal over supply of the market (as a result of mine expansions and commissioning of new projects) vis-a-vis regional disparities in demand and consumption witnessed over the last decade.As investor appetite for new projects wane due to current low prices and demand increases, prices are likely to rebound in the longer term, though uncertainties still abound with consumption expected to slow down in China to 3.5% vs 11% per annum witnessed over the last decade, then secondly,as governments and companies begin to look at aluminium as a cheaper alternative to copper."
"But healthcare represents about 17 percent of the U.S. economy, I would interpret that as hardly micro."
"*The Economist*'s article touches on an interesting point of income distribution and the differences in inequality between countries. In countries like Sweden (or most of Western Europe), people believe in equality of outcomes, whereas in China or the US, people believe in equality of opportunity."
"The article brings up an interesting question: is a large discrepancy between the rich and the poor a motivation to the economy or not? some say yes, because the rich will invest more if they have more money (which will stimulate the economy and create jobs, etc) and people of lesser mean will be encouraged to work more to make more money; however, if poor people of great talent do not get opportunities, then it is discouraging and it does not work for the economy."

Hi All
"I think that cronyism is particularly an issue where government tenders are involved. If two private firms want to make a deal on the basis of friendship or family ties, I guess that is up to them as they will be taking the losses for any inefficiencies that follow. It is different when the cronyism involves public money, but I think that can be avoided with transparency and accountability. Of course, there needs to be public will to hold elected officials to account."

"The slope continues because there is more people using the same capitol (infra structure). The more people you add the fewer they get from same investments, unless the company invests more."
Looking at the reasons for the disparity in incomes is a complex issue.  There are certainly other factors other than educational attainment contributing to this disparity. Maybe some of the Economic Policy changes that were implemented by the Federal Reserve for instance may have enhanced some of this disparity-especially in the last 10-15 years.
"I don't think you should think of it in terms of how many unit a consumer is purchasing and then averaging out the price per unit.  For example, I don't have a car and when I go to the dealer to purchase my first car, I am willing to price that first car a little higher.  Now that I have a car, for me to buy a second car the price has to be much lower than the first car.  This is because I don't get as much benefit from the second car as I do with the first - law of diminishing marginal benefit.  I will only purchase the second car if the price drop to a point where it is equal to my Marginal Benefit for a second car.  Let say my marginal benefit for the first car is 15,000 and the second car is 10,000.  Let say I am buying 2 cars at different time.  I only purchase the second car when its market price drops to 10,000.  Together, I am buying 2 cars but at much different price point.  I pay 15,000 for the first car and 10,000 for the second car.  I don't buy two cars at the same time and pay 12,500 for each car."

"It seems to make economic sense from a player's perspective to enter the NBA immediately after high school because players are at their physical peak and demand is high. Playing in college, players risk injury that may prevent them from being drafted into the NBA after college. If they skip college to play, they can save the money and attend college after the NBA is done with them or after a NBA career-ending injury. College will be there later; the money from a pro career may not be. (From a team perspective, high school kids are likely to accept lower cost contracts. So the potential for profit is high.)"

"The article focuses on short-run, and the problems of said utilities. It raises the interesting question of inefficiencies in industries. Subsidies are said to be a form of inefficiency, but they are also, some would argue, what allows for industries to grow (creating an \infant industry\""). While I suppose there are two sides to the issue it does seem to put the importance of inefficiencies in doubt, and while the article points out that the subsidies in this situation are excessive, I think it could be argued that it would be necessary to measure the costs and benefits in the long run."""
So happy to be part of this class love you all.
"Income inequality is easier to observe than the reasons behind it. Gini co-efficient definitely helps in demonstrating the increased income inequality in the last 3 decade, also the impact that inequality has on the economy of the country. However it points out the lack of consensus on reasons for these inequality. Due to lack of proper understanding about the reasons for the inequality the solutions proposed so far have not yielded the results desired."

Hmmm... About the industrial revolution, I believe changing technologies shifts supply curves."
This is a good point-- there is a tradeoff between efficiency and equality. You will learn more about this in Public Economics courses.

Hello!
Thank you
The opportunity cost of going through college is one that hurts professional baseball players. As a professional athlete they have a very short period of time when they are in their prime. Losing these few years where they could have access to the resources of a professional basketball team can hurt their growth as a basketball player and not allow them to reach their full potential.
"I agree, and I am hearing from a similar NYC debate that funding temporary housing in shelters or hotels is actually much more expensive than subsidizing housing, yet many people prefer to pay the higher cost of temporary housing so as not to \encourage\"" people who could otherwise manage to live with relatives to \""become homeless.\"" I suppose that would represent a demand shift for subsidized housing?"""

Hello - Do you mean Price = Function( Demand ) ? As far as I understand it's the other way around here: this model talks about the case when Demand = Function( Price ) . You may find several explanations/ideas in the discussion following the previous video.

I do agree.

"While superficial examination of this case might suggest collusion more detailed analysis shows no evidence of it. However, the facts may have little to do with decisions of current ideology-driven political DOJ."
I would like to see an economist's response to this recent article from Politico-
I wouldn't want to work in TN!
I think computer science is now the most popular major at Stanford. Some of this is surely caused by:
"Yes i do agree that income disparity stems from larger systemic factors- from govt policies:in taxation,in education & unemployment to cronyism. It is easier said than done - to say\ Need to attack cronyism and invest in the young\"". Most policy-making people in the govt comes from rich, well-connected families & do not always have the social awareness of the real state of school system, or need to worry if they can pay rent next month or care much if the unemployment rate is above 10%. Income inequality will only become wider unless there's major attitude change: govt being more FOR the people, rich people being more generous and share their wealth to less fortunate (build schools, fund after school activities), and for the poor to not lose hope and strive for better life through education and not crime."""
"But in long-term, prices could fall, not only because construction industry in China will fall, also copper_s recycle increases and the sustitution with aluminium."
"If rent control is enforced, then the housing market will never be efficient. Rent control will naturally cause a shortage, as rent control is a price ceiling. If there is a shortage of housing for the population, the market cannot be efficient. There is a way to keep the price of housing low while keeping the market efficient, although it is not a likely event. An event could cause a large shift in the demand curve to the left, lowering demand drastically, causing the equilibrium price to be quite low."
I was not error because the new quizes are granted with points
"Silicon valley has opportunities for employment but the high rent prices have become an obstacle for the potential employees to move into the city, making price of leisure high. High wages in silicon valley could be becauase of the scarcity of labor in the area. So,if we talk in terms of real wages, they should be comparable to the national real wages. Therefore the model is not reaching the equilibrium because of the constrained labor supply, possibly causing a dead weight loss."
"This bipartisan law improved the situation for the country by providing less money to those who do not care to work and providing more money to those who need help when they need help. Since then the law could have been fine tuned to become even more effective. Unfortunately, the law is being reversed gradually as current administration seeks to have more and more people on public aid and food stamps. Furthermore I do not understand all the drum beat about income distribution as in this question. I do not believe that there is or will ever be a country with equal income distribution. Can someone name one? How about workers paradise like North Korea, Soviet Russia, old Communist China, etc. etc.? Does anyone write about their Gini coefficients? They are close to 1.0"
Some more facts that might make you ask how much these unelected central planners of our economy have been failing for decades:
"The article concerns the current economic notion that income inequality at the national level reflects economic inefficiencies stemming from non-competitive practices (cronyism, corruption, monopolies), and from limitations on the opportunities for economic advancement that are available to people in lower income brackets. The author recommends governmental policies that invest in education, and support opportunities for economic advancement across the entire income spectrum. Over time, these policies will change the distribution of income of the nation by affording young people and lower income individuals opportunities for economic advancement, while de-throning the economically privileged status of too-big-to-fail banks and similar entities. I agree with these recommendations and they appear to follow from the economic explanation."

"Yes, frequently it is due to some pressure group. Or sometimes the economic argument is not made or people do not understand it.  That is the reason why courses like this are useful."
Two other reasons why Computer Science has become more popular as a major at Stanford is that the CS Department reduced the math requirement and more students admitted to Stanford have expressed an interest in computer science compared to other schools.
"I could open it normally, just close the subscription ad and you should be able to see it (at least from Spain)."
"But there is no such thing as free apples in the real world. Who would grow and harvest them?  No, it is pretty clear that apples on this planet are not a public good. Also you could apply your example to every good, and then say every good would be a public good."
"In this case the article talks about the long run. Firms can operate and not make profits when this is only on the short run, in other words for short periods of time only. If the situation persists firms willl eventually go out of business."
"Considering the fact that a closed market cannot sustain for long, ultimately when there are competitive suppliers in the market who are willing to supply at a lesser price and efficient product, Why not? Though there may be concerns regarding the security issues, the United Launch Alliance is anyways not being transparent regarding the purchase costs of the rockets, however,Boeing and Lockheed merged as the demand did not support two suppliers in the market."
the issue as mentioned is that the real wage and net benefit is depreciating by the high rental cost there is a psychological issue also some people think it a geeks business it's the opportunity cost of not taking computer science measure an d take someother measure
I believe NBA should drop this restriction so as to allow players to start their career earlier and not waste money on 1st year of college as well as the opportunity cost of not being paid for one year .
"NBA decided to drop the restriction of that players must be at least one year removed from their high school graduation in order to enter the league , after studying it from an economic point of view so that players don't have to pay money at the first year of college as well as suffering the opportunity cost of not entering  the league during the first year ."
"the surplus of copper has decreased the cost in the market. However, a prospect rise in the demand for this metal, particularly from China, could have effects in the equilibrium because the surplus is expected to decrease rapidly. Also, the proliferation of other metals in the market, like aluminium could shift the curve of demand to the left given that consumers incline for aluminum instead of copper."
I did some further online searching and found a good article at http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/frontiers/Capacity_Bldg/WTP_Manual.pdf on how Willingness to pay is actually collected.
"The way to earn more money is to be worth being paid more money. It's true; the world is not fair. But, on the average if we make the effort to be worth more we will earn more. I think a good way to look at life is to do everything possible to improve our own life our self and when that is done look for other sources for for the causes of absence of success.  and this is what Economics is about."
"In my school district, Macro is taught before micro. My teacher for Scholastic (Quiz) Bowl is always ticked about that since he used to be a econ teacher of both classes."
"The article details out the situation of tech jobs as well as rising wages in silicon valley. It points out that the wages for tech jobs have increased at a phenomenal high rate,  while the wages are rising, there is still an insufficient supply of talent. More so even if the wages are higher, the living cost is increasing at a higher rate so there is a net decrease in the real wages."
"The 1996 law to overhaul welfare as we knew battled income inequality by putting those on public assistance into gainful employment where possible. It used a number of requirements and incentives to get people out of poverty, including work requirements earned income tax credits, child-care subsidies, and health insurance for people leaving welfare."

PUBLIC education is a public good. It is non-rival and non-excludable with hugely positive externalities.
"Also there many other factors, there will be more sufficient use of copper, there will be more recycling, they will look for more copper sources and there will be an alternative for it. Chinese industries are also trying to be very diversified in terms of raw materials."
Rent control will cause shortage whenever the price rises above the max price.
Thank you.
Education is a public good. It is used to teach children how to be responsible adults and to be productive members of society. The benefits of such instruction result in a more orderly society with less crime against other members of the community and in invention and innovations that reduce efforts expended at work or within the home.
"Some key points were that the economic disparity within countries were growing (which could lead to problems within the country) whereas global economic disparaity was lessening, with the poorest countries getting closer to the mean and the richest countries starting to get into more debt. "
"Investing such tax money in something like education for students can help level the playing field in the future, as currently many students from poorer families simply can't get into the higher learning institutions due to a lack of money, not aptitude. "
"As the price is lowered, the quantity demanded increases."
"This article mostly talks about the short run of the power companies although some paragraphs discussed about the long run. The \conventional\"" power firms are nearly at shutdown point while renewable energy firms are making large profits. Firms can only operate and not make profits when the price is above the AVC, which in this case, the conventional power firms' AVC is under the price by far. If this situation persists, the conventional power firms will have no choice but to shutdown."""
"The copper market was flooded with supply, so the product was no longer scarce. People pay for scarce products, as mentioned earlier in this course."
"In this particular case, speaking as a taxpayer, a monopoly on U.S. government funded space flight should not be allowed.  Competition allows equilibrium in the market to inform price rather than having the firm chose a price based on their own interest in earning higher profit.  This competition is in favor of the consumer, which is this case is the government and by extension the taxpayers. Even though a monopoly can reduce dead-weight loss, the notion that the cost of space travel has \tripled\"" in five years points to the fact that the benefit of the reduction in deadweight loss is grossly outweighed by the fact that the consumer should be paying a lower price."""
"In this case the firms would want to collude to reduce wages.  For example, if an engineer at Google is being head-hunted for Apple, that engineer can go to whichever firm is offering more money, or he or she can use the offer as a means to negotiate for higher pay at his current job.  Without this competition for employees, the engineer does not have the opportunity to increase his or her wages like this.  The reduced wages decrease labor cost for the firms and increases the profit margin.  For this reason, an understanding of this kind in beneficial for Apple, Adobe, Google, and Intel."
Division of labour leads to specialization.
"This is one of the cases we studied earlier in this chapter, a monopoly was formed by the merge of Boeing and Lockheed in order to benefit from economies of scale."
"This is an example of how, after repetition, competitors (oligopolistic) end un reaching an agreement (colluding) so that their benefits as a group are maximized."
Like the pace
"I agree that some studies do not find employment effects of the minimum wage, while others do, the explanation could be on who is the beneficiary of the studies. Definitely is the trade unions commission the studies definitely the conclusion will be in their favor, same applies to the business owners. Also during the introduction of this course the Prof mentioned that economists don't and will never agree on one thing."
"There should be upside or downside competitive advantage to almost everything. The new measures mean Germany will now have a higher minimum wage that either the UK, where it is currently ¡ê6.31 - rising to ¡ê6.50 in October - or the US, where the federal minimum is $7.25 (¡ê4.20). From this analysis I am thinking Germany wants to be the leader Human Capital in the EU by adopting a higher minimum wage.Just my thought"
I think the main rationale for the DOJ's lawsuit was an increase in the price of ebooks due to a collude among publishers together with Apple.
"\Our Peter Orszag Problem\"" is an example of the concept of government failure in which self-interested behavior on the part of government employees can lead to actions and decisions that bring benefits to them and work against the interest of the public. More specifically, the article demonstrates two concepts pointed out in the discussion of government failure. One is the model of public choice in which those in government take actions that maximize their own well-being and the other is regulatory capture in which a regulator is likely to come from the very industry he or she is regulating, then administers the agency in a manner favorable to the industry, and finally leaves the agency for position with the very industry that was regulated."
"As a result of the architect of the 2009 stimulus package moving into a investment bank after his engagement with the government, it is very likely that he will be able to exert special interests over the Govt to favour some form of future spending or tax reform.   There is too much vested interests for a non biased outcome to be maintained, resulting in a concentration of power by the large companies at the expense of the consumer."
"Since the number of students in a university is limited by the capacity of that university, so it cannot be considered as non-rival."
"Absolutely. The number of students has a limit. So if I'm admitted, one vacant seat would not be available for someone else anymore. Moreover, as it requires paying the schools and universities, the lower quantiles who cannot afford that are excluded mostly from benefits."
"I think this is a good reason to keep the monopoly and not to let to another company to do this delicate work, taken from the article."
"I agree.  This is exactly the case that just occurred with Cedric Ogbuehi from Texas A&M.  The school helped the player take out a loss of value insurance policy to protect him (the player) from the possibility that his draft stock falls (accompanied by compensation loss). This could prove an intriguing possibility across college sports as players ensure a backup for long term earnings (assuming that the job they attain with a college education pays more than the one they'd get without said education), but they also protect their short term earnings potential by protecting their current value."
"Google took a price-cut strategy to tackle the market head-on. A customer has to pay 2 dollaars for 100GB storage, and if there is no price cut, he or she should spend 20 dollars to possess 1TB, but now it costs only $10. The strategy is consistent with the demand curve and the diminishing marginal benefit. The demand curve slopes downward because of declining marginal benefit, in this case, customers have a declining willingness to pay for more storage. So the price for more storage should decrease, and if the price for more storage is lower than the marginal benefit, there will be customer surplus, and the customers will be pleased to buy it. This price-cut strategy could help customers to form the habit of using the cloud strategy and could also attract more customers from other competitor companies."
"Rent control in SF will cause market inefficiencies. If price ceilings are implemented, a shortage of rental units will result from such market intervention."
"It seems to me humans are innately bargaining beings. Trade will happen regardless of government.  However, if the requirement is for trade to happen in a particular way, then a constraining arrangement may be necessary (or not). But then the question becomes a political one."
"I think scarce is the right word. Scarce means that there's less of something than the demand, i.e. not enough for everyone to consume as much as they like for free. "
The fixed cost component can be seen as the initial investment by the firm to setup the production plant. Now you can view the problem as a long term process. The marginal cost of 30 includes some amount of profit made by the company in my view. That profit overtime is enough to break-even the company's initial investment. I don't think we should view the marginal cost as the cost to company but the marginal cost should also have a profit component attached to it.
This topic is very important and significant.
"Becasuse it is a flat line, (by the definition of a slope) the slope is say a, the equation of a line is given by y=ax+b. For an perfectly elastic supply curve, a here is equal to zero."

"The definition of a public good is one that has: 1)Non-excludability, an 2)Non-rivalry in consumption. While like many other examples, this is not a perfect example of a public good, I think that it meets these two criteria fairly well. Public education allows anyone to participate as define by acts such as \No Child Left Behind\"". Also, giving one child an education doesn't necessarily mean that another child does not get an education. However, because of recent budget cuts in many school districts - more people joining the public school systems means that it takes a toll on the system as a whole. This is one example of how education isn't a perfect public good. Private school, and almost all universities do not meet the \""non-excludability\"" criteria though because of the rising costs associated with higher education today."
"The labor boom in Silicon Valley is especially interesting, looking at the high labor demand for very qualified individuals that promises high wages as an incentive.  There is something significant about how Silicon Valley has been portrayed in various forms of social media, and may make it more attractive for the best and brightest young engineers trying to decide where to start their career.  I think, especially at Stanford, that students will feel more motivated to major in computer science/engineering to pursue more opportunities with higher wages.  It does seem a significant factor that housing for engineers is more expensive in Silicon Valley than they would be having to pay elsewhere in the country as an engineer, however, the appeal of the higher wages and the idea of being an engineer in SV is attractive enough for many young people to choose working in that area over others in the country."
I can't 'add' a thing to your discussion.  Not even sure that my 'ditto' is an adeqaute echo.
Hi!
High elasticity of supply means that a tiny change in price results in a large change in supply. Perfect elasticity is the extreme case of this: an infinitesimal change in price results in an infinite change in supply.

"the only possible explanation is that, there are things other than wage rates ,that is changes the outcome of the different studies, the model is accurate to some extent but there are some factors should be put into considerations the model is good so when there are change in supply or shifts in curves ,there are will be no change or at least theoritically such as advancement in technology added to it the investemnt on labor trannning by firms in this case the law will affect the wages ?? for the coming and less skilled workers but for the more skilled workers barely it will affect the wage"

"The law essentially reduced the amount of welfare given to low-income workers. According to the article, this reduced the amount of people on welfare by 60%. This could be explained by saying that before the welfare cuts, the slope of the graph of total money made vs. hours worked for low-income workers was too low. That is, before the cuts, it would have been more profitable (including the opportunity costs involved in working) to not find employment, and instead live subsidized on welfare."
"The thing is, \education\"" isn't one single thing.

"Family planning is a controversial topic in our politically polarized nation.  However, one of best ways to reduce demand for welfare would be to aggressively educate single mothers on birth control.  If the government provided free contraceptives to welfare mothers, there would theoretically be less demand for food stamps, less need for public housing, and less need for childcare services and child support.  China enforces birth control for everyone.  I believe  the U.S. should consider enforcing it for welfare recipients."

"Hello, earthlings!"
"Competition in the labor market for engineers benefits engineers joining the market because higher wages will be available.  This is illustrated in the labor supply and demand model:  with higher demand for labor (demand curve moves out) in an elastic market, equilibrium for wages will move up the supply curve, marking the equilibrium wage at a higher wage.  The reaction that students have to this trend will be that engineering will become more attractive to study because the job market looks better.  This is the elasticity that moves the supply curve to a new equilibrium.  "

"In my opinion, the entry of Apple in the eBook market probably led to cheaper prices of other electronic reading devices, in this case, Amazon's Kindle. But there's no reason to think it should have made eBooks prices go down. On the contrary, taking into account the legions of fans that Apple has as a brand, we can infer that there will be a shift to the right in the demand curve of eBooks, as there will be a lot of new users of this reading device. Problem is that these should have shown at least in a few weeks, as it was the case with Penguin Books, instead of immediately, as happened with all these other Editors. But all in all I cannot see enough evidence to condemn Apple for collusion with the Editor houses."
"The way I see it, the person who is starting his own business is not working for someone else, so you would have to call his efforts \leisure.\""  With rising salaries and a tight labor market, the opportunity cost of not taking a job rises, with the substitution effect taking potential entrepreneurs away from their projects.  At least until the 'income effect' allows them to go off on their own."""
"The higher wages for Silicon Valley engineers persuade more students to choose their majors in engineer. From the Supply-Demand model, the higher for labor demand will move demand curve to the right (moves out). As a result, this new demand curve will intersect the supply curve at a higher wage in equilibrium. Then, more students choose to become an engineer because of higher wages. The supply curve will move to the right (move out) and intersect the new demand curve at the new equilibrium wage. I can see what students react to the high wages in the tech industry.The number of students who graduate in CS major is the highest. I believe that those students have incentives to major in CS from the higher wages."
"The article said that in 2006 Boeing and Lockheed concluded that there was not enough demand to have two competitors in the market.  If that is true and if Space X qualifies and is allowed to compete, it would seem likely that the Boeing-Lockheed alliance would exit the market.  We could then expect Space X to behave like a monopolist, including raising prices.  Would the result be different from the monopoly situation we have now?  If Space X has lower costs, we might still get lower prices as a result of negotiations between Space X and the government, but we would not get a competitive, or even an ologopolisic market."
Neither could I.
"Apple entered retailing market of ebooks and diminished the monopoly of Amazon on ebook marketing. From the market value of ebook selling via Amazon, Apple's argument on increasing the market competition thereby increasing the cost of ebooks to market competitive price is a good move to the publishers who will make more profit. However, working via Amazon as a monopoly and selling ebooks, the price of the books has been much lower but is not at the shutdown point for the publishers that they never made an effort to increase price or sell books through other resources until apple opened gates, which means that they were still making a profit. However, the DOJ action on Apple and few publishers for price fixing could probably be a way to curb on the increase in the price of the books could be a decision taken from the social point of view - the need for reading habit to be still in place as the cost of the ebooks might go up much higher than other forms of entertainment like films and music. This will depreciate the market value of ebooks and accessibility to everyone."
"I think that conspiracy among companies is a good option to keep prices high the problem is that nobody need to know about this private decisions taken by top officials rather what happened with Google, Apple so on. This is a country where it works very well, we have that kind of problems with national and international airlines that offers flights among cities with high price tickets and nobody know why.some people say that this is for taxes or maybe for combustible cost, but the truth it's I don't think so, I think they are colluding to force us to pay those charges.. well, it is hard to think about that there are people in nearby countries with cheaper rates than here."
"The demand for engineers in Silicon Valley is high, yet the supply may be being kept low as a result of a housing market that is too expensive. Though income rates soared for engineers, housing rates in the Bay Area soared even more which likely prevents engineers from flooding into Silicon Valley from all over to meet the demand for labor. I think students will be drawn to the high wages in Silicon Valley because their skills will be in high demand. Yes, many skilled students in the area would like to stay in the area and get a job due to the tech boom and the feeling that there are many options in the area."
"The wages for Silicon Valley engineers may be modeled using the typical supply and demand curve model that we discussed in this section, supply being determined by the worker (engineer) and demand being determined by the firm (tech company). However, since factors such as limited housing in San Francisco are in play, the supply of engineers may be limited although demand for them is high. Because wages for these engineers is so high, the opportunity cost of leisure is higher in this industry in comparison. Therefore, there is more incentive to work for an established company rather than starting one¡¯s own business, because the leisure cost is so high. My peers are definitely drawn to the high wages of SV jobs, much like many other students who are pursuing careers in the tech field."
I agree with your conclusions regarding the inefficiency inherent in rent control strategy to increase affordable housing. Reducing production costs in the form of reduced taxes would lower the equilibrium price and increase supply.
"Under the ACA, contraceptives are to be provided without charge.  Not sure how you would \enforce\"" contraception for welfare recipients.

"Artificially low interest rates are a real danger to the economy. They are another example of government meddling and I believe the cause of economic collapse recently. Economic decisions by governments are not made on the basis of sound economic principles bit rather on the basis of strictly political considerations of getting more votes in the next election and repaying supporters from previous election. Thus, the purpose of the Fed is to help ruling party stay in power. Period."
"The increasing interest of computer science at Stanford is mainly because of the increase in demand for this type of labor, the increased wages for engineers and the increasing opportunities computer scientists have.  Students definitely have and will continue to react to the high wages in the tech industry by majoring in computer science or by taking for technology-focused classes."
"Education is a public good when the government offers public education and requires children to be educated up to a certain age. It is non-rival in the sense that if I was getting properly educated it would not mean that someone else had to be less educated than myself.  However, certain higher levels of education such as a private university or graduate school are not offered to the public and are not non-excludable.  There are positive externalities involved in education, with the result being a more intellectual, educated population."
"There is a market for Bitcoins though it may not be universally accessible.purchasing Bitcoins may have more to do with intrinsic value like anonimity.Government regulation may negatively affect its value, negating intrinsic advantages.

"i just read an article from J Stiglitz in which he argues that in the U:S, the average income is as low or lower of what it was a quarter of a century ago. He says that this is not because the productivity has stalled but because the wages have stagnated."
regarding education it can a public good if we are talking about basic education like primary and elementary education .it is non rivalry as there is public schools for all and non excludable as no one will be harmed if you consume that it is available for all.
"I think the law was correct in its main idea, which was to push people to take charge of their lives rather than rely on government assistance.  This sort of law will likely need to occur again to end the current deficit spending that cannot continue forever.  The details could be argued; five years of assistance for a single family might sometimes be too little, but it is a compromise - providing enough assistance without leading to reliance on assistance (and five years is a long time).  For those that want education, perhaps other forms of assistance could be considered, such as a program of lower-cost universities (rather than the $30,000 tuition now common) usable by anyone."
"In theory, I believe education should be a public good, but in our current school systems it is not. There is a massive quality gap in education that is a result of public versus private funding, quality of the school district, presence of charter schools, and institutional practices. Because the quality of education is not the same across the nation, it cannot be deemed a public good in the same way that national defense can. Education is rivalrous and excludable. It is excludable because certain social injustices prevent certain types of students from accessing education in the same ways that other students are able to. For example, individuals coming from various socio-economic statuses may have varying resources to buy school supplies, receive help on homework, receive proper nutrition for development, etc. As compared to national defense where anyone receives protection regardless of race, class, or gender, education does not provide the same blanket coverage. Additionally, education is rivalrous. I would consider education to be a limited resource, especially higher education such as college. There are a limited number of spots for attendance and a limited number of scholarships to enable students to attend college. For this reason, education is rivalrous because one student's access prevents another student from accessing it. In a perfect world, education would be a public good provided with equal quality to all people but that is not the current state of affairs in the United States education system."
"Although in theory, education should be a public good where one person getting an education should not affect the ability of another to get the same education and everyone should be included, the reality is that education is not a public good. There are many examples such as public schools that require a lottery system to get in. This fails the definition of a public good because it is rival. Even within a public school, the ratio of students to teachers creates even more rival situations. To further prove that education is not a public good, there are examples of private schools and even state colleges require tuition which excludes students that can not afford it. Externalities involved in education are benefits to society and the communities benefit from more educated individuals whose benefit to themselves is even less than the benefit they provide to the community."
"From the article on Silicon Valley wages, we can model the behavior of the tech labor market by plotting the supply of labor that constitutes the workers and the demand for labor which is the behavior of the tech firms. This demand curve for labor has increased and shifted to the right recently with the tech boom from social networks and also led to an increase in wages for the workers. However, the increase in wages does not outweigh the increase in the cost of living in Silicon Valley. This means that the real income that workers get is less than it was before. Because of the high cost of living, workers prefer to move and work in other areas that would provide them with better income and lower costs of living.I've noticed that many students are excited about the high wages they can earn but I don't hear many of them talk about the cost of living which means that they probably haven't put much thought into and take offers based on the highest wages."
"The law aimed to address income inequality by supporting the poor temporarily and motivating them to work. Lower income people need to meet certain work requirements in order to be eligible for services such public assistance, tax credits, child-care subsidies, health insurance, etc. People receiving transfers may not feel the need to go work because they are receiving benefits without working. Further, the law makes clear that the benefit of transfers is given to those who work a specific number of hours and days. Businesses in certain sectors should focus on hiring inexperienced people and by doing this more jobs will be created. Increasing the earnings of people receiving welfare will help to implement the law and will reduce welfare dependency."
"Education is a public good because it meets the two criteria: non-excludability and non-rivalry in consumption. Although some education can be beneficial in the form of positive externalities, not all education(private school, higher education) is equally available to the public due to high  costs. The increasing technology accessibility for free education has truly made education a public good. With sites like the Khan Academy, people have free access to learning resources and learning is more attainable. Education benefits public overall as it helps to create a more knowledgeable and intellectual society."
"Yes, retention of employees is also another reason and as mentioned by <redacted> this could also be a way to cut down on compensation demand: however, I believe these tech companies have better company policies on compensation regulations and incentives - besides they stick upon the compensation limit at the time of calling for candidates - so candidates who will be going up in compensation will automatically will have an escalation in their career progress as well."
Economics interests me though I don't know it. It's good to have this course!! I can develop knowledge that I can use later.
"Since low interest rates are also needed to spur investment by business, I don't think they are a significant danger to the economy."
"It implies that the demand will be considered decreased only when there are fewer quantities demanded at the same price rather than lower quantity demanded due to increase in the price. Essentially, a shift in demand curve rather than movement along the demand curve is considered as change in demand."
"It wasn't just the excessively low interest rates that spurred the last housing bubble and crisis, but the rate at which the interest rates were declining. With a constant decline in interests rates, the demand of housing ownership increases rapidly, resulting in people taking on home ownership when their incomes could clearly not support it."
"This article discribes the situation surrounding the lawsuit against Apple, Google and others. However, there are little details that would clear up the whole situation. The bottom line is that these oligopolies agree not to hire each other's applicants. This is alarming. First of all, they are creating artificial barriers for salaries to rise. This has adverse effects for workers who may deserve a remuneration raise but cannot get it by moving to a different vacancy. Second, these oligopolies already have huge profits, as we know, and such collusion are totally unfair."
"The article have shows the concept of oligopoly, some companies made strategic decision to reduce pay which happens to be a violating of Act. I think the companies did that to maximize profit or cut cost but the strategic happens to affect other which brought about the collusion."
"In general,fewer people drink, and also with many health campaigns, lots of people who were going to go to a pub may go less often or not at all. Others may choose to save money and drink at home. Since there is a viable alternative of the good (beer), then people will tend to choose the cheaper one. As the pubs get fewer customers, their fixed costs stay high, so their average total cost is higher, and many pubs are forced to close."
"By increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit for married couples with children, a part, at least, of the disincentive for recipients of means-tested benefits who are married.  The government should encourage marriage in its system of incentives and transfer payments.  Education, too.  Children born outside marriage to high-school drop out moms are six times more likely to experience poverty."
"Just like a free agent market in sports or an auction, if people are interested in someone/something, they will bid up the price of them. By avoiding people that others already interviewed, the companies can keep down artificially the demand and price of each worker."
"Basically, Amazon was charging cheap prices for e-books, as there has to be an incentive for people to switch from normal books to ebooks. Apple came in to a market dominated by Amazon and charged higher prices. The reason why the DOJ filed a lawsuit is because of this discrepancy in price, but rather, the two economists say that Apple's prices were more accurate to the cost of the e-books. Both sides have their justification, and it basically relies on the value one holds for e-books, not a physical book. Apple and the book publishers want to make as much money as they can, so a high price is logical, and isn't quite illegal, but it definitely does not benefit the consumer, whom the DOJ tries to protect."
"For me, it says that I have to subscribe to continue reading, so I'll just answer the question based on the information given to me. I assume that because many pubs have closed, that demand must have decreased, shifting the demand curve to the left. When this occurs in the short run, the price and quantity falls, forcing firms (in this case, pubs) out of the industry. The average total cost will also rise. In the long run, the supply will decrease after firms leave, pushing the supply curve to the left and once again, the price will be the same as how it started out except that there is less being produced and consumed."
Apple has always been an overpriced brand.
"The low interest rates are what causes the bubble, however, during these record low interest rates, it's correct to point out that incomes are still stagnating. The problem I see with subsidizing the housing market with cheap money is that people are ignoring all the malinvestment and opportunity costs of diverting all that capital. Not only does it sucker people into unsustainable investments (NINJA loans with teaser rates) but it robs other parts of the economy. It's the fallacy of ignoring the context of the larger economy to focus on the issue of concern."
"China and Japan seem to confound the smaller class size argument. MOOCs are the future in many ways, but you have to deal with a restricted market due to an educational establishment that will attempt to marginalize them as hard as they can in terms of serious credentialing.

"Without a doubt, technology/engineering is a hot field of study, and many people decide to angle their education towards preparing them towards a career in such a field. With higher wages and a seemingly-ever-growing technology industry, many, many students will go towards such fields, thus flooding the labor market with people, which will eventually drive down wages in the field. I have definitely noticed that a large majority of my friends have gone down the engineering/technology path, even if they didn't seem to have a huge interest in it during school."
"As ideal as the idea of minimum wage is, so is assuming that minimum wage is the only factor at play for employment effects. There will always be a different set of conditions, be it time of year, technological innovation, weather, population, individual variation, etc., so each study is bound to have some variation in result. Sometimes confounding factors will \prove\"", sometimes they will help contradict. "

"THe law intended to get more poor people working and ultimately earning more total income and more total income from labor instead of means-tested transfer programs like welfare. When people are in the labor market, they have potentially more opportunity to move out of the bottom 20% because they are participating in the labor market building work experience and possibly on the job training which often leads to better income job opportunities. Unfortunately the changes in the law  did not adequately address  or anticipate the extensive need for jobs and skills training for many women who have no practical knowledge of the working world. Providing an incentive to work doesn't mean success in the workplace if you have no practical understanding of that work place. However making certain transfers even more attainable to those who get employment makes more sense than when welfare provided more incentive not to work."

"Special interest groups pay extravagant sums for lobbyists who try to influence legislation that is favorable to the special interest group.  A conflict of interest arises when government officials who implement public policy move into private sector positions as lobbyists. As the article about Mr. Orszag implies, this is a form of corruption.  I believe there should be a mandatory waiting period of three years for any government official who seeks to move into a private sector job as a lobbyist.  I do not however think that Congress would pass such a law because it would not serve their self-interest."

To quote \diagram that showed the increase in the median price of houses in 2003, '04 and '05, during that period. That was also a period where interest rates were quite low.In the United States interest rates are determined to some extent by, the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve. We'll be talking a lot about that, in future lessons. **But the interest rate was held relatively low, and so based on this kind of a theory, based on this kind of a model that would make the implicit rental price on houses low. it would increase the demand for housing, probably would start to accelerate the, the price of housing and cause this boom here. And eventually, when interest rates had to come up, again, the bust.**\""  (My emphases added) "

"In theory public education is a public good in that has at its core the characteristics of nonrivalry and nonexcludability. But access to quality public education in this country is restricted based on location and property taxes. The good is this case is not entirely nonexcludable because there exists a price for the quality of the education  and those who can pay higher property taxes have better access to quality public education.There are certainly positive externalities associated with education and the entire society benefits when more of its citizens are educated. A better educated workforce makes for a more productive workforce, a stronger economy and overall healthier citizens and thus allows for a society or country to invest more in its development rather than its maintenance of its inefficiencies. Unfortunately the high cost of higher education continues to create barriers and the subsidies available ( scholarships, grants) are not enough to overcome barriers of high upfront costs and insufficient primary education that thwart too many people."

If rates are kept low, this won¡¯t be a ¡°healthy housing market¡±.  Stable trends in a stable market tends to be the most secure thing, so a gradual increase in interest rates would probably be the best situation."

"Rent control in San Francisco creates a situation where the price is lower than equilibrium price, as a result the suppliers would respond to the new price reducing the supply to the point where the new price equals the marginal cost. Nonetheless the house market in San Francisco is not a competitive market to start with; few owners control a small supply of houses, in this situation the government has to intervene to control a monopolistic situation."
The law encouraged low earning single mothers to move into the workforce by giving them credits toward child care. This was done to reduce the time they spend on Welfare. It does not seem that those on the very low end of the income scale were helped. And what about those on welfare with no children? What did they receive to encourage them to move into the labor force?
Agreed.  Perhaps Stanford can work out a deal with the Economist to allow students to access these articles without each paying for a subscription.
"The high costs of living will motivate workers and students to work more to compensate for the prices. The income effect will then be increase. However, as the wages increase, more and more students will have the initiative to work which will drive the wages down again. Much like the backwards bending curve, I think that the rate will fluctuate."
There is a Statement of Accomplishment.  Take a look at the Road Map for more information.
"Given the need to stimulate the economy, forcing interest rates low at this point in time makes sense, helping the housing market recover from the GFC.  Though over the long term, it would not be wise to retain such record low interest rates.  The housing market will eventually recover, meaning that if interest rates are retained at such low levels when that happens, the market failure which caused the GFC will repeat itself.  It is likely that the Fed will progressively rollback these economic policies overtime so that the recovery is slow and gradual, that is unless they run out of money to keep buying back Govt bonds.  If this happens, interest rates may be forced up and could put the whole economy on the line again; very interesting times ahead."

100 GB is priced at 1.99$ and 1 TB (i.e. 10 times of 100 GB) is prices at 9.99$. Marginal benefit of consumers is 10 times more cloud space with only 5 times price increment.
There are some industries that due to their high fixed costs and the stable and reliable need for their product should not be  deregulated. The electric utility industry is one of those. By giving subsidies and support to segments of the industry that are variable producers you put to much volatility into the demand curve of the high fixed cost stable demand producers ( like nuke and coal ) and as result you make their earnings and financial performance much to volatile threating their long term access to capital markets etc.. The govt. needs to question their long term business model and get to a much more stable industry.
"I don't even know where to being to unrig some politicians and self-interest. Not all politicians are this way.

"This assessment is not completely true. There are some countries that are not in debt. Actually, the main crisis of 2008 was triggered by the need of those countries to find and buy assets due to the need to invest their extra-money in something (e.g., Germany)."

The aim of this discussion is to understand why high school graduates forgo their college education after playing basket one year long according to NBA rules.
"Overall, I am unaware of the reasons the NBA instituted such a restriction upon players entering the league.  However, from an outsider glance, I do not see enough justification for limiting players from professional play for a period of a year.  Applying the concept of opportunity cost on the NBA's side (having players come directly to the league from HS vs. having them wait a year), I see limited benefit, possibly the opportunity to give teams have a better picture of how that player might perform, the greater (by a year) maturity players will have entering the league, or getting a player who is simply more experienced (by a year, both as far as the game, and the personal growth that player might experience as a student in college).  On the side of the player, I believe it is costlier to forgo the NBA for a year, if a player chooses to enter the league as soon as he is eligible.  The reason is that the student will gain any tangibly valuable asset (e.g. a degree) from going to college for only one year, and all the while missing out on possibly making a good sum of money."

"The excessively low interest rate can have both positive and negative side effects to the US economy. In case of positive side effects, the low interest rate would decrease the cost of owning house. People will pay the lower cost for each month or shorten their loan contract. This is an incentive for people to have their own house. However, the low interest rate might cause people to save their money less than they used to be. With the low interest rate, people might choose to spend their money in other options, such as investment. This can boost the US economy but it would result in increasing the inflation rate as well."
"The GDP is a very simplistic measure to capture an aggregated snapshot of the economy.  This is useful to measure changes over time but is less useful when wanting to interpret the meaning of this change.  Some values like Education and Health are not able to be captured by GDP...though on an aggregate level...there is correlation with an increased GDP and increased health.  Hence, the usefulness of GDP whilst simplistic...can generate beneficial outcomes though can also have unintended consequences if given too much focus."
"Low interest rates usually stimulates demand as people borrow more to spend on the wants and consumer durables, which in turn leads to demand-pull inflation leading to a growth in the economy. This in turn further leads to a rise in the GDP and an increase in the standards of living."
Good question: I'm wondering about it myself.
"Google did dramatic price cut to capture the maximum target market out of the total available market. The  drastic reduced cost attracts more number of consumers, as demand has a negative relationship between the price of the good and the quantity demanded by the consumers. "
See above. This assumes the capital is fixed (i.e. you only have one field).
"Rent control or price ceiling will lead to reduce in supply, so it will create shortage of houses on rent, hence the dead weight loss will be generated. The market with dead weight loss in not efficient market."

"Because the demand is so low and the barriers to entry so high, this is indeed a market with little competition. Letting SpaceX into the market is good for competition in the short run and will allow the government to extract better pricing, but one may expect ULA to exit the business, as its two partners earlier concluded that the market could not take two competing firms. It could be that longterm equilibrium actually favors a monopoly, so I envisage SpaceX eventually increasing its profit once ULA exits, and the pricing level will more or less return to where it began."

That 80 cents would be about .035 cents after inflation:
"I think that the main reasoning for the DOJ's lawsuit was that they observed a sharp increase in price after Apple entered the ebook industry. Based on the article, I believe that the two economists' argument is that Amazon had a monopoly in that particular industry, and so when Apple entered the industry, Apple provided competition causing the price to move towards the equilibrium price. Both sides have their justifications, so I think that more investigation will be required to make a true decision."
I agree that we cannot forget about the risk of inflation. We will come back to that in later lessons.  Thank you for the great chart!
"I think that education is a public good because this is provided by government and most people pay the taxes and a part of it goes to educacion to pay for teachers and build schools. also, it satisfies the two characteristics of public goods which is nonrivalry and nonexcludable, when nobody could be exclude to consume this good."
"Thanks for your question, Edridge. I have discussed it with <redacted> <redacted> who will write to you discussing the issue."
How is your situation Pareto efficient? Everyone would by better off (and you won't be hurt) if you give some of your money and resources to others.
"The supply curve of the labor market, due to the higher wages in the tech industry of Silicon Valley, will be one of two possible choices. First, it could be a backward bending supply curve due to the income effect. The second choice would be that the labor supply curve will just be upwards sloping. The latter choice would occur only if other factors affect the choices of the workers, such as the workers must support a large family, leaving less time for leisure. "
"The evidence implicates multiple factors contributing to high long term unemployment including minimum wage and other government meddling ,discrimination against long term unemployed as well as overly long and generous employment benefits."
Decreasing productivity is the result of mounting rules and regulations slowly strangling businesses in the overall antibusiness environment. The only real remedy is to alter the 3 branches of government which is difficult but possible through the electoral process.
"According to the Spending Allocation Model, an increase in government spending increases interest rates, which lowers the consumption, investment, and exports as a part of the Gross Domestic Product.  If the problem were fixed (which may save half the money), less money will be used by the government, lowering the interest rates and increasing consumption, investment, and exports."
The Fed is walking a fine line between providing capital for continued economic recovery and avoiding increasing inflation. Short term adjustments allow it to change its actions frequently and easily depending on economic conditions.
"Many are disappointed in the very slow pace of the recovery and the fact that we even had such a deep recession.  The question people are debating is whether the Fed had a role in that.  The performance of the economy was much better in the 1980s,1990s and until recently."
I agree and like how you explain this.
When I used following simplified-but-reasonable supply & demand curves I find both consumers and producers are well off by equal amount when demand increases i.e. both consumer surplus (CS) & producer surplus (PS) increased by same factor:

Your conjecture in your last question is correct. Material in some of the videos posted in the Econ 1 links go into more detail.
There are several reasons behind closing of pubs in UK.
"Studies of any topic usually do not provide the same results due to the subjects of the research or the method of the study. In this case, owners in different restaurants may react to changes in the minimum wage with different methods. "
The article lists market failure as a cause of income disparity which may be part of the problem and also a cause for lack of access to education which then feeds into further income disparity. It is not surprising then that this slows growth as business men as far a Henry Ford chanted that your workers are also your consumers. Therefore if the population is poor do not expect your company to prosper as who will buy your product? This may be where government intervention on things such as minimum wage come in.
"As a result of the overcharging on defense contracts by Northrop Grumman and DynCorp, the government's share of GDP must have increased, which means that the share of GDP available to the non-government sector necessarily have decreased. In other words, the non-government supply curve shifted to the left. This translates to  a movement along the demand curve that results in a higher real rate of interest and lower GDP shares of consumption, investment, and net exports."
"you are right, professor !!  the  education is a people's right. it can't be a public good. "
"Right now ,there is monopoly in the market. Monopoly makes consumer to pay more. So, if the SpaceX is allowed , then there would be competition in market. Competition is good. May the government can save a lot of money if SpaceX provides low cost solutions. So, according to me SpaceX should be allowed to compete with the United Launch Alliance."
Agree with the content you state
"things that are consumed this quarter/year but were produced in a previous quarter/year should not be counted under consumption in this quarter/year. If things counted as inventory investment are later sold out during the same year, they should be counted as consumption but this amount of market value should be subtracted from the inventory."

"I particularly liked one issue discussed in this article. It concerns the equality of income and the equality of opportunity - \some societies are more concerned about equality of opportunity, others more about equality of outcome. Europeans tend to be more egalitarian, believing that in a fair society there should be no big income gaps. Americans and Chinese put more emphasis on equality of opportunity. Provided people can move up the social ladder, they believe a society with wide income gaps can still be fair.\"" Being from Europe, I am more in favour of the American approach. It is very important to have opportunities, to have a chance to realize yourself, and by realising yourself to contribute to the overall goodness. If the one is  blocked in a system of \""fair\"" distribution of incomes, the iniciatives, inovations and etc. might be blocked. We are a society of individuals with very different capabilities. One may be capable of leading a multinational organization of thousands of employees, whereas the other one may only be capable of having a small flower or newspaper shop. Why should not the first be in the 1 %? As for the second one - he should earn  enough money to live his life with dignity."""

"As a result of overcharging government, the overall government expenditure has increased, hence leaving less of GDP share for consumption, investment, and exports.This would result in increase of equilibrium interest rate and which would ultimately reduce the GDP share of consumption, investment, and exports."
"I think that SpaceX should be allowed to compete with one caveat: they need to rigorously prove that their reduced costs will not endanger the success of the launches. The Defense Department needs to be sure that SpaceX is fully able to account for its cost reduction through vertical integration; if they cut corners in any way, then it is better to stick solely with ULA."

"The social welfare policy of free cash handouts has been banned and revised to encourage employment specifically of single mothers. Some of the key limitations that good affect on imposition of tax was relaxed with the following schemes introduced through this bill - \work requirements and time limits on public assistance, tax credits for low-income working parents, child-care subsidies and health insurance for people leaving welfare\"" - and have concerned the issues that should cater to the needs of those whose income are below market equilibrium wages."""

For a good or service to be a public good there should be non-rivary and non-excludability. This cannot be said of eduation as rivary in education only exists in societies with limited skill labour (teachers). On the other hand it is impossible  to eliminate the issue of free riders in education as knowledge will alway trickled down from the educated to the non-educated in the society hence providing the fact that education is a public good.

"In conventional models it is believed that,Increase of minimum wage leads to low employment.New research revealed that,it is not necessary that increase in minimum wage will lower employment each time. This impact is very subjective, depends on nature of business. Sometimes, increasing wage provides incentives to labors, make them work hard and grow business so this leads to more employment. Sometimes, increasing wage make income effect, that leads to lower employment."
Obviously rent controls or price ceilings are not Pareto efficient because both consumers and suppliers will be better off at equilibrium price. There is huge DWL due to loss in both producer and consumer surplus.
"I do think the GDP is the best way to measure how a country is performing financially. It is not the best way to compare the US to other countries since some, like Italy, use black market goods in their calculations. So, just like we adjust or inflation to get the real GDP, we should also have a black market adjusted GDP when it is being used for global comparison."
"Both theories have merits. For many people, having a job is honorable in the sense that they are able to support themselves and others. On the other hand, there are people who do not enjoy working and would rather not work due to the poor wages they receive for the immense amount of work they put in their (past) job. I believe that the argument that there are systematic biases against the long-term unemployed is more plausible because no matter what job a person takes, his or her standard of living will likely be higher than that of people living on federal jobless benefits cheques--enough money to barely survive with enough food to feed oneself."
"My first instinct to explain why the long-term unemployed have such difficulties finding jobs is that employers hold biases against such people. This is because the long-term unemployed may be thought to be less valuable in the work force because they have been out of work for such a long time and therefore may require more training (more time, more effort, creating higher costs at the expense of the company). It may also be that those who have been unemployed for the longest amount of time are also the least skilled workers available and therefore the least qualified for jobs. However, the second theory is also valid because unemployment benefits are so generous. Perhaps ironically, those who have been the longest unemployed may also be the same people reaping the most benefits from the federal jobless benefits cheques and therefore have even less incentive to return to the workforce."

This is the conventional definition. It is a matter of the nature of the good. The definition helps you determine whether government should have a role in providing it.
"I don't know about external debt, but the US already owe something close to 14 trillion to themselves (internal debt). That's a BIG lot."

"The excessive charges from Northrop Grumman in its contract with the US government has many negative outcomes. The $100 million in questionable spending by the government is $100 million in spending taken away from other sectors. The nongovernmental shares of GDP is the leftover money after government spends its shares. Excessive spending thus reduces the amount allocated for nongovernmental spending including Consumption, Investment, and Net Exports. Assuming that this excessive spending was a change, there would be a result change in the supply curve shifting it left, which would increase the interest rates and decrease consumption, investment, and net exports in the coming years. At such a large amount of money, the government must be more prudent in monitoring these military contracts because their budget is not the only one that suffers."
"It's hard to say which argument is right, but to some extent, the federal jobless benefits cheques may be a reason that's more plausible. It's true that some employers may discriminate against the long-term unemployed, but obviously not all of them would do so if the firm is indeed lack of workers. And on the other hand, compared to countries in Europe, the natural unemployment rate is even higher than U.S., one reason is that their good unemployment benefits and insurance, which discourage people to find jobs. If people could not find a job in two or three months, he/she may be lack of motivation to keep searching, and especially when he/she could get some cheques even without having a job."
"I think both arguments for the unemployed hold some validity, but it is more complicated than that. There are certain benefits that you receive when jobless, so people are less incentivised to look for a job. Some people value their jobs whereas the unemployed dislike them because of workload and poor wages. Standard of living of someone who has a job is higher and for that reason, I think long-term unemployment is not beneficial."
"I think in the case of unemployment, there is evidence for both theories contributing to the issue. Certainly employers discriminate against people that have been unemployed for a longer period of time because employers would question the person's ability or drive to find work if they have been out for a significant period. On the other hand since it is difficult to find a job that pays what a person feels they deserve to be paid, jobless cheques certainly decrease an unemployed person's drive to find a job. However, since the quality of life is not great for those living on unemployment federal cheques, I would argue that people are looking for jobs that will better their situations with the biggest problem being that employers discriminate against employees that have been unemployed for a while."
If by any chance Mohamedgad is monitoring responses:
"If I expect the economy to enter a boom, I should go long, because with increasing real GDP, interest rates will decrease, and bond prices will increase. If I expect the economy to enter a recession, I should go short, because with decreasing real GDP, interest rates will increase, and bond prices will decrease."
"By the definition provided earlier, the unemployed are those who are without a job and actively seeking a job. The unemployement figures should, if the theory about benefit cheques are right, decrease since these long-term unemployed end up not looking for work. "
This would probably lead to funds being spent elsewhere by the government. Thus the other variables of GDP would not be affected much as the non-government share would remain constant.
What makes these additional expenditures so heinous is that government spending directly affects the other shares of GDP. It cuts into non government shares that influence our economy.
"The overcharge by contractor to the government increased GDP share of government. That caused the decrease GDP shares of consumption, investment and next exports."
"I believe the theory stating that employers discriminate against the long-term unemployed is more plausible because I don't think benefit cheques would incentivize people not to search for work. Today, it is very hard to find a well paid job out of unemployment, and many of the unemployed are not willing to settle for minimum wage jobs. The longer you are out of the work force, the less motivated you seem to an employer."

"You should wait, at least, 2 weeks until they are available."
"Overall increases in government spending reduces GDP shares available to the private sector. This would shift supply curve leftward. This will cause real interest rates to rise and thus consumption, investment and net exports to decrease.Given that government spending is in the trillions, these particular over expenditures will not have a significant impact on the supply curve shift. But if this excess waste is indicative of government spending in general, then the supply shift is more radical."
"It would be interesting to see what the Fed was attempting to do with inflation, since decreasing interest rates is an excellent way to increase inflation according to the AD-IA model.  The lower interest rates stimulate more spending and risk, which may cause a bubble, which is what happened in this case.  A lack of caution in the interest rates may lead to a situation such as this, and the result was a burst and recession which is not yet recovered."
"I think that the main rational behind the DOJ lawsuit is that they believe that Apple collude with the makers of ebooks to increase significantly prices.

"Lower marginal tax rates may increase revenue as the supply and demand curves reveal, but they also have ancillary consequences. For the highest incomes, lower marginal tax rates in the U.S. have corresponded to dramatic growth in executive salaries (becoming \excessive\"" from the point of view of many shareholders). If one compares the 1950s (with marginal tax rates for the highest incomes at around 90%) to today, it appears that executive demand for higher pay in the 1950s was muted because executives would keep so little of the increase, whereas now, they keep much more. Granted, other factors (stacking compensation committees; winner-take-all culture in the U.S.) have also probably influenced this change."""

"Marginal benefit is the change in the willingness to pay as more is consumed.

"Letting players enter the NBA immediately after high school assumes that they will stay healthy long enough to earn more money than they would earn over the course of their lifetime if they had stayed in college and earned a degree.  This will not hold true for some players.  Some players will suffer career ending injuries.  Not all players are paid like Kobe Bryant.  As such, allowing players to enter the NBA immediately after high school will create a cohort of players who will end up in inferior economic circumstances as compared with the situation they would be in if they had completed a degree."
"I suspect that economists at the Fed are correct in predicting increased demand after what was at least in Chicago the coldest winter on record. The weather during the winter sharply curtailed people going out, traveling, and shopping. I think that in the foreseeable future the price of bonds will go up because the stockmarket may be nearing another bubble bursting. I would go long."
"In warmer weather, people tend to travel more. This means the consumption in the economy will increase. The real GDP will be higher than the potential GDP. As a result, the inflation tends to increase in the long run to push the real GDP back to the potential GDP point. When the inflation rate increases, the Fed will increase the interest rate as well. When the interest rate increases, the bond price will decrease. This means I will go short by borrowing bonds and sell them in order to take advantage of decreasing prices."
"I like the model, but when real interest rates are negative, as they have been for several years, net exports should be positive.  Yet we are currently running a $41 billion trade deficit. So the model doesn't explain what's going on with net exports.  Also, the crowding out effect should cause interest rates to go up in the consumption and investment sectors, but it hasn't.  So the model really doesn't explain what is happening in the economy at all.  It tells us what should happen, but that is not what's happening."
"Based on the table, the share of GDP for consumption has consistently been increasing from 61.8% in 1961-70 to 70.0% in 2001-2010, while the share of GDP for government expenditure, net exports and investments have been decreasing. While there are no abrupt or distinctive trends, we see that net exports decreased the most significantly from 1<phoneRedac> to 2001-2010, from -1.5% to -4.5%."

I believe those that are unemployed for any duration have a hard time finding work or even a interview in a difficult economy. I know of recruiters who tell job seekers not to bother submitting a resume if they are not currently employed. the belief is the more desirable candidate is gainfully employed. The unemployed are assumed to be not as skilled as the employed.
no need of improvement it was just simple and easily understanding
I think one reason for the long-term unemployed having such a hard time finding a job is that federal jobless benefits program are discouraging individuals from actively looking for work. 
"I think the reasons for the negative productivity growth is due to mainly on less technology growth. The government shall have the policies to give incentive to increase the technology growth. The capital stimulate has limited effect since there are diminish return effect on productivity growth from capital growth. The more capital injected into the economy may not help the productivity growth. The new policy shall encourage more technology innovation, by lowing the tax so the firm can have more capital to spend on R&D, to improve the technology."
"And it also steals capital from other sectors of the economy, which will see underinvestment due to the malinvestment."

"I understand that it takes some time for inflation to adjust to a sudden change in government spending, but I would think that the pressure for it to change would be there immediately. The analogy would be when you are trying to move a very heave object. You might not move it much when you begin to push on it, but over time its velocity will increase and its motion will become noticeable. My guess is that this would also happen in the economy. In fact, I would guess that bond and stock markets would have an immediate reaction to the drop in government spending as a reflection that the downward pressure is already there, even if the motion cannot yet be seen."

You have to be clear about what you mean when you say correlation.  Two variables can be correlated in the sense of empirical correlation (I have 100 samples of each and they have high correlation) or theoretical correlation (The sum of 2 dice and the value of the first die will be highly correlated and I can compute the exact correlation).

"Hi, in my previous course there was a button for Final check for EVERY problem so I resolved a problem and put an answer, then Final check button. Then I started to work on the next one. Here, we have only one Final check button on the bottom. Now what is correct? 1. To write ONE answer and then push Final check and so on for every problem or 2: To write ALL answers to ALL problems and then push Final check only ONCE for all the answers? I'm afraid that when I resolve ONE problem then push Final check the system could consider my unaswered yet problems WRONG. Thank you."

"Data is data, it shouldn't really make much difference to you ... with the exception perhaps of stuff later in the course, more with regard to the interpretation of what your statistical findings actually mean in day to day terms.

you can use this program
I can't download the videos.Does the video require some specific browser to open or tool to download?  
You may need to upgrade your browser. Other coursera courses need Google chrome to work. <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>
Thank for your course. I will try to follow it regularly.
"hey,"
"Hi to everyone , i am Tasos.I am finishing my bachelor studies in Mathematics and i am looking for a master in (Bio)Statistics next year.I need a refresh in these basic topics in Statistics."
I am an undergraduate student in Mathematics.
"I needed to install Google Chrome as well, as it didn't run with Windows Explorer 8."
I am really liking these lectures. They have presented the concepts in a very easy to understand way. Thanks Stanford team!!!!
Perfect. Downloaded VLC and now I have video and audio... although low quality.
"I think all the quizzes are due then, just by the end of the course. If you look at the Unit 1 HW due date, it's June 18th, which is next Tuesday - which is when it should be due."
I prefer the edX structure to Coursera.  YMMV (your mileage may vary).
It would be helpful if each question had a separate  Save and Final Check button (as in other courses on the Edx platform)  instead of the only one at the bottom of the exercise.I had a problem where I thought that I had saved the answers as I had a yellow marker stating that my work had been saved but not graded and I clicked every time for each question. I got suspicious because in the meanwhile I could not browse and then I logged on to the site from my mobile phone and could see that my answers were actually not saved because there was some communication error between my Modem and LAN card on my desktop whereas  my wifi was working .Thus if we have some problem either with the net connection or local computer we can easily think we have saved a lot of our work whereas it may not be so.At least with the individual save and check buttons for every answer we can get to know that our answer is not saved compared to the en-masse save button. I do hope that this thing can be resolved and thanks in advance.It will really help especially when we have internet or computer issues.
"I agree also I faced a problem where I thought my work was saved but it wasn't as my net connection had a problem but the \answer has been saved\"" yellow box continued to be there with no way to know if it had really been saved)(and it wasn't !!)"""
In other Edx courses  if we give a more accurate answer (for eg 66.27 instead of 66.3 ie if the answer shows a higher accuracy it is graded by the autograder as right whereas here it is marked wrong.Is it possible for that to be instituted ? I lost a point for being more accurate !I do agree that it is mentioned to write the answer as x.xx etc but at times this gets confusing as each question has a different requirement and accuracy for higher decimal places or above can be set  by the Edx platform autograder to avoid more accurate answers being marked as wrong.
Thanks! Looking forward to learning this topic with everyone!

Students: don't assume that everything will work on all platforms. Course staff: it would be helpful to post a warning somewhere on the site that students should use Chrome or Firefox instead of IE."
I'll contact the administrators to see if they can change the structure of the homeworks.
"I'm afraid you will have to install R 2.x on your computer for Deducer to run. The Deducer installation process is slightly finicky, but it is a really powerful and intuitive GUI, especially for those who have little experience with coding.

The subtitle bar on the side is covering part of the video.

Imagining that you cannot assess if one person took more or less than half a breath, and data are rounded to the unit, I think respiratory rate should be considered a discrete variable.

"¡°Don't lose sight of common sense¡± strikes me as an odd bit of advice, considering that statistics is an extremely helpful tool that allows us to derive conclusions about the world, whereas what is known as common sense is mostly a set of preconceptions that are not used to being challenged."
Yup IE seems not to work so well so I am tryinr Firefox: wish me luck
There is a discussion that I have lost track on but YES I asm one of those who can't get things to work on IE (IE 10). Firefox os working so far in terms of submitting a quiz answer and getting feedback. However it still was not obvious if the quiz fo rmodule 1 had only one quiz question. I am assumingh yes since I got the one question right and my current quiz score is 100%.

"You do have to keep a skeptical eye. Years ago, we had a \data analyst\"" entering and doing analysis runs for us.  In one data set, the mean and variance for one site for IQ-type scores for students was way off.  I asked for a listing of the data file.  Sure enough, one case had a listed value of 461.  When I asked if she had seen that, she said, \""I thought it looked funny.\""  But, of course, she ran all the analyses anyway.  Leon Kamin published a work pointing out that Cyril Burt's life-long study of identical twins for heritability of intelligence was immediately suspect if you looked at the results.  Decade after decade, Burt's correlations (as new cases were added to his aggregate data set) were exactly the same, to 2-3 digits. As Kamin put it, \""It's far more likely that the sun won't rise tomorrow [than to see such an event with real data].\"""""

"Our definitions of common sense may differ. What I usually observe when people refer me to any such thing is just a collection of preconceived notions.

Hi Bryanctag
Thank you Kristin.  That helps.
Rhis has been answered before - all videos contain all the subsequent parts  of that section as one video file.
"So, why not finish them by Sunday at midnight?  Then, you'll be done 1-1/2 days ahead of time."
Worked for me...
Thanks for the help. 
Go to part 2 using the scroll bar above the video box.
No problems for me using Chrome and IE.
Use VLC media player - It plays those videos. Are you sure that the videos have a .mp4 extension ?

"Many folks have asked about the availability of \Part 2\"" videos.  This response is true for all modules with multiple parts."
"Since the sort and search functionality on the the Discussion Forum is somewhat limited, would it be possible for the course TAs to add an FAQs section to the top menu that includes canned responses to all the recurring questions?  This would allow students to search there for some of the general site-related answers.  Some examples that come to mind are: availability of power point slides, availability of part 2 modules, other web resources for stats, and so on.  If the TAs do some summary stats on the categories of postings, they may find some low-hanging fruit that can be posted on an FAQ link, then respond to applicable forum questions with \refer to FAQs\""."

To be honest my experience with Chrome on edX is that the first video in each section always autoplays. I just click play and pause immediately and that sorts it. A little tedious as I downloaded all the videos in one hit at my local library as my internet access is a little flaky at home.

You have to install the package.Go to Packages and Data and go to Install packages and install extras or go to Package manager and check the DeducerExtras as default and load.
One thing that I noticed is that you should not try to install Deducer through R but directly try to install Deducer.(That worked for me)

"Interesting debate regarding the normality of height. Let me pose the question differently to show that height (and many other measures) cannot be normally distributed, although it can be well approximated as normal. According to the normal distribution, there should be the same proportion of people above the mean as there are below. However, height is >0, whereas it has no maximum (although in reality there could be a limit). So, suppose the mean height is 1.6m, and 0.0001% of the population is 3.3m; if height is normally distributed, then 0.0001% of the population is -0.1m tall, which is not a valid value. The actual % is irrelevant, to the argument."

"Thanks for the nice feedback and for the suggestion. We decided to limit homework submissions to one because some of the later homeworks contain a lot of multiple choice and true/false, so resubmissions make it a little too easy.

So hopefully no one will be overly penalized for silly math errors."

It's important to check your answers - make sure they actually make sense, and if you can do a calculation multiple ways and come up with the same answer, then you will be more confident that you're doing it correctly.

"Quizzes are numbered sequentially regardless of the unit they are in.  So, quizzes 1-5 are in unit 1, quizzes 6-10 are in unit 2, quizzes 11-16 are in unit 3, and so on."
"This has been mentioned in several other posts already.  The quizzes account for 10% of your grade and you can try them multiple times for practice.  They are kept open until the last day of class (8/16).  However, the professor recommends attempting the quizzes for each unit as you progress through the course since they help prepare you for the homework which is due weekly."
"Hi, i pressed link by mistake to unsubscribe from the mail. How am i going to sort out this issue?"

"Some of the problems in later modules have multiple radio buttons.You may have clicked on a particular button but worse still you may have not clicked a button but clicked in the area right of the vertical line on the left side of the page.This selects a radio button nearest to it. I had answered  some questions and did  save some them individually but some in groups. While rechecking I was horrified to see that my choices had actually changed and luckily I did not hit the final check button and re-corrected them and submitted them. I would have got 6 answers wrong when actually I had got all answers correct !.This problem also occurred in another Edx course and they had to change the radiobutton method to another one (The square button kind).I really look forward to the individual Save and Submit buttons for the home-works. It is really difficult to scroll up and down to save and when you are doing your homework in a \timed\"" manner like in an exam this can be a really painful interruption to the flow of thought.Also  in serial questions where the answer of one progresses to be a part of the question for the next question this causes a complete collapse of the next questions despite knowing the methodology(usually due to  things like rounding etc if not due to a wrong method !!). I hope these problems are solved but I really think the radio button and individual save and submit buttons should be changed at the earliest."""

"Accidentally, I have pressed the Submit button beforehand. As a result, it appeared that I have missed HW2 submission. Can I do something to fix?"
For the BMJ statistics notes try this link:

"Shouldn't we be happier if we won a lottery, because the chance of both winning a lottery AND dying in an airplane crash is only 1/14million x 1/14 million =1/196 trillion? If anyone ever wins a lottery, the chance the person dies in an airplane crash will be 1/196 trillion."

"Just don't do any more work (or do it, doesn't matter). You'll fail the course, but who cares, it's not like this is going on a transcript or some permanent record anywhere."

The course is really interesting. Though I have learnt statistics during my college days doing problems and checking the answers instantaneously gives a thrilling experience. Thanks for availing the oppourtunity.
"Hi, I clicked submit accidentally when I have only completed half of homework 4. Is there any way to reset and complete the rest of the questions?"
"The software team should really change/reduce the clickable area of radio buttons. I consider it a design flaw when it opens possiblity for making an error so easily.

It seems that you need a lot to understand simulation softwares. I advice you to read before you speak.

"Hi,"
> So both answer must be correct.
"Hi,"
You can just check it and it is automatically submitted.
Thanks for letting me know--I will pass your note onto tech support.
Thanks for pointing out!  I'll see if we can get this fixed :)
This week is more challenging for everyone! Some of you will find Week 3 to actually be the hardest of the course (probability is tricky!!). So I hope you stick with it. Things get more conceptual (and easier) again after Week 4.
"Hi,"
A lot of the formulas are in the weekly summary sheet in the Overview/Teaser section of each week (below the video).
"Hi, In week 3, lecture 3 at about 8 minutes 40 seconds into the video, there appears to be a minor typo.  It's also seen in slide 91 of the week 3 slides. "

I always use the downloaded video and the power point slide in tandem.The video resolution is poor and so we cannot read some detailed slides (especially the tables etc) so having hthe slide along seems to solve most problems.
"Professor, This was an awesome analysis. Now probability started making sense to me :-)"
I think that is a reasonable way to think about it.
Really i cannot thank you enough . Thanks very much
"true, but if you factor in the money from the lottery will allow the person to fly more often (e.g. trip around the world), then because they sample more flights they are more likely to die in an airplane crash!"
You are welcome

"Hello,"
i think that we can solve this withoout baye_s rule
Attention! If your wife starts to give birth to twins it could become a habit. They say genetics.
The formula for the standard deviation for an ordinary data set has you divide the sum of the squares by (n-1) to calculate the standard deviation
"In the explanation using Bayes' rule, there is a typo for the P(resistant) value. The decimal point is in the wrong place."
"Yeah, I guess I should have checked here before doing the assignment. I had the same problem."
It should allow for both answers. I'll double check that the tolerances are set correctly.
"Yes, thanks for catching the typo!  We will fix it in the future."
Glad to hear it!
I guess we have to assume that there is no dependency.  :)
"I finished all the modules.It is a great course.Few feedback points- the last few chapters move a bit too rapidly.While I did score 100%  I still don't feel confident as we did not have actual examples to run for with a mock data set and use it on R (particularly Cox regression etc) so if a problem on Cox regressions etc could be added it would be helpful.Also the examples being run for say logistic regression could be run on Deducer (the provided software) so that we can be walked through the process rather than the other software(I think STATA) by the course director(especially the examples in chapter 8 and 9 with the same data she is using  or mock data so that we can run through the process in parallel with her while watching the video to get a \hands on \"" approach to doing those statistics.(The R exercises on deducer were helpful) I managed to run some regressions with whatever data I had at hand but it would be wonderful to be able to do it alongside and with the teacher to confirm the method and process. "
same typo in the video 4.4.2 as well (timestamp: 5:00)
That's weird! The article has the same methodology as the correct solution! Are you sure your math is correct?
BY my friend Gordon Doig a Biostatistician
"You are fast! I'm trying to come up with more R exercises but can't really go faster than the course at this point, so, I'm sorry you didn't have a chance to try to run a Cox regression. There are datasets in the `survival` package that are intended to help with learning this technique."
"Hi fellow learners,"
Thanks. i am looking forward to doing them when they are posted. I had some personal issues which forced me to do the course quickly !
"Shouldn't matter. The solution shows both methods. I didn't use Bayes, and was marked correct."
"So sorry you haven't clarify me the answer , but i had understand where was the confusion to me"
Thanks for making that available for the class!
Thanks for the feedback and great job finishing the course so quickly!  The last unit just introduces Cox regression and logistic regression; and you could easily have a whole course on each of these!  It's a great idea to add an R lab for this unit--and will likely happen in the future.
"For me too, please do post a detailed explanation, I couldn't understand this question."
hello
ok thank you so much.
"RIGHT. Sorry, that was a dumb question. St error = sample s divided by sq root of n. Thanks!"
There are no dumb questions.Better to ask than not to know.
"I was unable to submit my homework 2 and could not save it either, on June 25th before the deadline."

No it depends on the possible number of repeats.
"There could probably be a warning (like in banking websites)\Are you sure you want to submit the answers\"" that can become red or yellow could flash on clicking to avoid these inadvertent clicks. Also probably the radio buttons could become red or yellow when clicked to lock on to the answer unless changed."""
"And Bayes' rule should come into it, too..."
"Audio quality is just fine! Even you watch the lectures on youtube or download them, the voice is quite clear. I guess the problem have been arose from your playing devices."
I think that can only be done after Tuesday.
"The deadline for HW2 has passed, you will no longer be able to submit it. You shouldn't have a problem with the quiz for Unit 3, Module 2, though. I just checked, and it works fine. If you're using IE, please switch to Chrome and try again."

"Seems to me that the comment saying that for NPV (and also PPV) you must have prevalence of fractures in the population is absolutely correct.  The ER patients are hardly representative of the population in the matter of prevalence. It looks like this is a measure of specificity. Please some of the staff or teacher explain better. I quote from her slide: \(NPV) depends on the characteristics of the test (sensitivity, specificity)**and the prevalence of disease\""**"
A faster method:  
"Several people including me, posted similar comments/questions to that of Ramanuja in the area for comments/questions just below the area of the video display. I am not clear why there are 2 areas where questions are being asked without any integration. I suggest to have one area devoted to questions/ comments etc. All of them were stressing the importance of prevalence in the general population (rather than of a group of patients in one ER, that could be catering to a very particular clientele such as those who were refused treatment in other facilities)."

Staying with course honours I will try and not give to much away but I was so far off when it came to question 9. I went off on a trail of thinking (i) how many possible combinations are there (ii) how many possible combinations have one particula pizza at the end and just gave up after that.
"Same problem here, perhaps they can increase tolerance for this question."
Just curious would some people like to discuss careers in medical stats. Is it possible for someone without medicine or a phd in stats to have prospects in this field?
The comment from the instructor didn't really help and lead me down the wrong path and got the wrong answer. It should be rounded to the nearest whole number. I would rather not having those rounding hints.
I wish I saw this thread earlier. The hint lead me down the wrong path :(
"You can have this problem again . You'll have to be watchful from problem to problem . What about the calculator feature provided in each computer that answers far more precisely , far many decimal places ."
"Can't edit comment. Yeah, many of the students in this class discuss solutions before the deadline of the quiz. Some of the discussions didn't have follow-up and I went down the wrong direction. I should have provided hints without calculations."

I had the same thing on Homework number 2. I was .03 off and got it wrong...and it was definitely rounding...grr
"Same - Q6, week 3. A bit annoying to use the correct method, but be marked down due to rounding. Especially when the rounding of a 0.5 is ambiguous."
"I answered a similar question [here][1] . It reads: as far rounding off issue is concerned, it's always better to keep fractions & not to use rounded off values in intermediary steps, & round off only the final answer . This ensures high degree of accuracy irrespective of whom & where do you answer, because at times we deal with some probabilities that are very very small . This approach seldom let you down ."
"From the sound of it, you should increase the number of digits reported by your Matlab script. If you rounded 0.xyz48 to a 0.xyz5 and then round 0.xyz5 to 0.xy(z+1), then it is wrong. Even 0.xyz<phoneRedac>999 should be rounded down."

Which one chooses is a matter of subjective opinion . Arguments can be given both way . Such questions ( at least in present form ) should best be left for subjective type reasoning & not included in MCQ which is for objective questions . Use of word 'only' ( ..authors should only..   ÿ if ... ) is the weakest link in whole argument & perhaps sufficient  too to weigh the scale in favour of option 2 . Medical literature is meant to cater to a whole range of readership. All readers of a whole range of Medical Journals can not be bracketed together .  Hence my humble request to you is that for this question also, tolerances be adjusted so that both answers are allowed ."

That was an interesting discussion. In fact  in one of the problems in this course there was such a difference between the normal approximation and the exact binomial it was striking and this makes it was now to understand how computation with say small values using a normal approximation instead of an exact test could lead to dichotomous results especially if one uses one method for CI and one for the p !!

"You're right, the wording of the question should be changed to make it clearer. Thanks for pointing it out!"
Thanks! We'll try to fix that soon!
"If you want to access the discussion for a particular module, just go the that module and click on \Show Discussion\""."
Thanks Tarek!
"I really feel bad for you . I faced the same dilemma while doing modules of unit-4 ,because difference in values from different sources is a known problem . But when I finally settled to do homework and opened the page to my surprise , there were 2 links to necessary calculators etc to do all statistical calculations required in the homework & I got all right with these . The first link you mentioned is not appropriate choice for calculating Z-score as it gives values of z-score rounded to 1st decimal place only which can not ensure level of accuracy expected in some exercises . The second link stattrek gives z-score highly accurate ."

Awesome!
"There is organisation. People choose either to ignore this, or they haven't worked out how the system works."
"Could you add this feature \Show Discussion\"" for each Homework or create a group for each homework."""
I did not document all the errors in the transcript.  I took note of the slides and transcript.  I actually found a lot of errors in the transcript.
"NumberBot, even with that instruction, you can provide an answer like 4.99, instead of 5.00.  And I have been penalized for that reason.  The discrepancy can be due to the precision of your computer or calculator as opposed to the one the instructor used.  Moreover, if there is more terms involved in computation, it is very likely that the number may not be what the instructor expected!!!  (Funny, that reminds me of her lecture on Var(X+Y)).  In Numerical Analysis, there is 'tolerance'.  I think we should allow some tolerance in this class to account for rounding discrepancies.  I hope the instructor or a class TA would respond to this!   It is sad that you worked so hard and then did not get the credit due to rounding!!!!"

"Should Continuity Correction be included as part of the Lecture in Unit 4, Module 6, Normal Approximation to Binomial?  Thank you!"
"However, as we have more discussion, it will take forever to certain on a topic and if you did find it, you are not sure that is all to it.  As the class progress, this will only be even more difficult to search for something because there are more discussion.  Please give classification of the discussion by its nature some thoughts!"
"Thanks, Mike!"

Hi!

Thank you very much. All your advices helped me to resolve my problem.
"Dear Dr. <redacted>,"
Download Video Links for Unit 4 in Wiki are not working. I can not download any of videos for unit 4.
There seems to be a 'typo' in the answers to Quiz Q no 3: '95% Confidence interval for a mean:' There is supposed to be just one correct choice but the answer for the choice no 4 also says '..is correct' and then goes on to narrate why it is incorrect. please correct it.
"There is no submit button because the homework is closed. If you don't have a Show Answer button, then the solutions can also be viewed on the Solutions page."
"No, you just use the menu to the left (arrow next to Show All Discussions). The system is quite efficient. It just needs people to pay attention and post in the correct spot. Something not many are doing."
"I don_t know if this has been addressed before, I_m pretty sure it probably has (no pun intended). Anyway, I accidentally submitted homework 4 before even typing anything in more than half of the homework. It_s really frustrating since now I can't finish it, so first of all I wont be able to know if my answers are right, and secondly, It will obviously affect my score (even if the lowest score is dropped)."
"Hi,  are there quizzes for this module?  they didn_t show on my computer."
"I have found that, for this course in particular, it has useful to test any tools were asked to use on problems presented in the lectures before using them to complete the homework. So, when the table mentioned above didn't yield the same answer as the one presented in the lecture, I searched for one that did: http://www.regentsprep.org/Regents/math/algtrig/ATS7/ZChart.htm. I should know why these tables differ, but for the life of me I can't figure it out."
Could it possible to download/print the quick summary worksheet in pdf format? Thanks a bunch!

"Hi Kristin,"
Hey staff in Unit 4 HW Q5 i rounded of my answer of 16.9 to 17 and got it to be wrong.Plzzzzzzzzzzzzz show atleast some lineancy.
me too had the same problem.
The tenth place is the first decimal place. To the nearest whole number would be 17.
Thanks. There was a very small change in the naming convention of the videos for that unit that caused this problem. Should be fixed now...

"I don't think we will be able to share the final exam with you until the last week of the course, sorry!"
Thanks a lot sir.I was a bit worried about it.May i please know when will the exam be taken i mean which date and what will be the actual syllabus.will it be whatever we would be going through in this course?and will there be any duration for the exam?and how will we get to know about it?

"I tryed to send the homework on time, but something's wrong with the website that it doesn't let me submit my answers. Please tell us what's wrong with it, or give us more time while you try to solve the problem with the web page."
The exam is worth 45% of your grade. It will be multiple choice and will be available for a period of at least several days toward the end of the course. Exact timing is still being worked out.

"There are previous notes on this, 3 choices in brief:"
"You can't compare the weight of a single apple to that of a single orange, but you can compare 50 apples to 50 oranges. It's a technical, though important difference, if you're using a parametric test. On the other hand, if you use a non-parametric/distribution-free test, then you could compare single apples to single oranges."
"Huik, this is insightful - thanks"

Thanks all-did try one. Seems to have been accepted.

Unit 6 Module 1 will cover this
could somebody provide?
Help
This is a very bad question as there is no way to judge the clinical significance of results that are not statistically significant without knowing the clinical details. It seems too convenient to ignore the statistics when it suits one!
Awesome. thanks dude.
thanks mate!
Great example--thanks for pointing out!
And there's an optional module as well that covers this in Unit 6...
"Fortunately, childhood cancer is rare (about 1 in 300). Thus, the odds ratios and risk ratios will be very close. In general, odds ratios can be interpreted as risk ratios when the disease is rare (as is often the case with case-control studies)."
"Thanks from me as well!  I did most of the homework using R, but my solutions were in many cases not as elegant as yours.  For example, I didn't attempt to use the dbinom() function at all.  Instead, I just used the choose() function to compute combinations for the binomial probability formula we were given.  So, for example, on Question 8 my more long-winded (but conceptually easier to understand) solution was"
"I kind of wish people would stop asking for special treatment. It's just not reasonable, it has already been made very clear that it's not going to happen, and it's taking up a lot of space in the discussions.  I've made plenty of silly mistakes too, got confused by the Check button, etc, but I wouldn't dream of asking for special treatment.  I hope that our professor and her assistants will just start ignoring these.  Sorry for the negativity - I wish there were a down-vote button we could use to lets folks know when their classmates are rolling their eyes!  So I'm providing this opportunity to use the up-vote button here as a down-vote button for the original post."
I agree
"AbbyNormal, Thanks for the alternate solution! I took the liberty of adding your solution to the wiki for comparison/learning."
The audio seems to be working just fine! Try re-downloading the video.
"I'm sorry, but it's very difficult for us to go back and change homework points for individual students. Please do follow instructions more carefully for future homeworks and quizzes!"
Thanks Robert and Simon!- was also puzzled.
I agree with Geocamdr.  no idea how to judge clinically importance of the results without prior background on the disease case.
"I made a wild guess for 11, totally missed it, but it was still counted right!  My guess was not even close to being within the limits that were acceptable given in the solution.  Then I carefully calculated 12 and got it wrong.  pfffft.  Win some, lose some!!!"
I am focusing on the conceptual difference (and similarity) between p-values and alphas. It is a subject related to the history of hypothesis testing.
So it is difficult. But if you undertake a task you have to make sure you can correct mistakes.
"I am also very anxious about the exam timing because that is the only specfic time period I cannot guarantee being anywhere near internet access (up a mountain in the middle of Greece, where I nearly always am at these dates). The cables have been laid down in the road right in front of my house but nowhere near connection date yet (and the way things are going here, we could just end up with having the cables only!)"
Thank you Paul very much for your help. 
Who is a Bayesian? I thought he was a Gallifreyan.
"OK, let's see: if that were true, you would just need to know the standard error, right? But how would you know it? Note that you need the standard deviation of the *sample* with the number of observations, to derive the standard error. How would you do it the other way around?"
I also found the Unit 5 homework much harder than previous units.  I have managed to work out answers but have not submitted yet so not sure how well I have gone.  The previous lecture on the odds ratio shows you how to calculate the answer to question 4.
Yes. In fact this is often done in bootstrapping
"I had the same technical problem with a one quiz and 2 homeworks. I used Chrome, and when I had resized the quiz/homework web page smaller than 100% so I could see the solutions I had previously worked out in another file the checks changed on the resized quiz/homework web page.  On the quiz when I reloaded the page to full size my entries were able to be re-entered correctly. Of course for the homework, with only one chance, I really lost points when I hit submit on a less than 100% web size page and checks were in some wrong boxes. I need to remember for the final exam to never resize the official final webpage and to use only the 100% web page when entering my checks for the multiple point questions. Although I could redo the quizs and that low homework score was dropped, the final exam will be more crucial."
Thanks for clarifying!
Warm greetings
"While some values might change, one is guaranteed to change."

Homework due Jul 16 at 00:00 UTC means midnight 15/16 Jul or 16/17 Jul?
Thanks! This looks very interesting. I am definitely going to read this closely!
Thanks. Got your point. You saved me.
Hello Kristin
Thanks guy...
I went to the previous unit and looked at  the odds ratio formula. I found it in the wiki unit notes section. I used that formula as is with the variables as listed and got the answer correct. Good luck.
"This is tricky. As <redacted> mentioned, the chat unit may not reflect what the question is asking for. I wish the problem was done with the same unit as the chart."
"No trick, she's helping."
Thank for the clarification & pointer to the odd ratio computation
Why are homework 5 and 8 due sooner than all other weeks?
I made a mistake in the post and can't fix it. Ignore my post and I'm sorry about that. I was remembering the problem wrong.
Homework 5 is still open so you should wait with this question until its deadline. Anyway I could advise you to use Z values calculator instead of table because it is more accurate and easier to use. This from homework 4 is fine http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/normal.aspx
Answering homework questions before deadlines - bad example for students :-)
I have a similar problem
"Hi, there is some information in the Discussion item called \Unit 6 Question 7. Risk ratios of a sample vs real risk ratios (of whole population)\""."""
Occasionally I've had no audio on Chrome but all I have to do is change the level (high or low does not matter) and I get audio again. It might help you as well.
i've downloaded Deducer and tried to follow the solutions to R exercises. however the deducer i downloaded doesn't plot graphs for me i.e. no window opens up with either the graph or the box plot or the like. 
"In general, two-sided are always used, unless you have some strong idea the the effect would be positive or negative. But as discussed in the video lecture, the vaccine's effect could benefit or not. You do not know the answer before the experiment."

"It doesn't make sense since it says in the course information \The Unit 5 homework is due Tuesday, July 16, by noon Pacific Time.\"""""
"It's not a question about anything to do with how to do it. In the lectures she said \this will probably be the only time in the class where you see a one sided alternative\"" (I may have paraphrased a bit) when she did one of the examples. Then, on the very next quiz, she gives a one sided alternative. I'm just trying to make sure she didn't make a mistake. I'm afraid. If she made a mistake and I answer the one-sided question correctly, I'll get it wrong. If she didn't make a mistake, but I suspect she did, and answer the two-sided version (thinking that's what she meant) I'll get it wrong. I was just hoping somebody who understood the difference and answered the question already, and knows (meaning they got it correct), could let me know: Did she make a mistake or not? Did she mean to give a one-sided alternative? I'm not looking for any guidance on what the correct answer is or even how to get it. I know how to do the problem. "
Thanks Robert!

You are right and I am really sorry for that. I leave it to the instructor or the course team to think if this should be addressed or not.
I haven't needed anything apart from a calculator and an online probability calculator. Why do you need R?
@BDZ: Thank you.
Are you sure sallysue? I've now done a bit of googling and skimming through notes and I seem to get something similar to formula that I had suggested (save that I had forgotten to take the square root). 
"I did an simulation of normal data in R and used it to create paired data, which I tested using both parametric (t) and non-parametric (wilcoxon) tests. I varied the effect size and the standard error. What I found was quite interesting. Indeed, the t-test definitely shows a larger p-value for the unpaired vs paired test, except when the SE becomes very large compared to the effect size. The interesting thing is that the Wilcoxon test doesn't follow this rule: there were some (though not many) samples, where the paired test p-value was larger than that of the unpaired test (ie. the unpaired test was more significant then the paired test). So, the question is, why would the nonparametric test (sometimes) show a lower p-value for the unpaired test vs paired test?"

Another suggestion. Stop shouting at us. And tell us who you are.
Thank you for the link!
I have enrolled for Stat course couple of days ago. I am unable to submit homework for the first five units.  If the submit button is available then this will help me to receive feedback for my solutions.
The last date for those sets are over so you cannot submit them but you can check answers.
"Might both the multiple testing and significance due to high numbers fallacies be behind the Encode \80% of the genome is functional\"" result?"
95% CI
Just look at the solutions for feedback on your answers.
"If you only clicked one answer, then you got the question wrong. You needed to click both."
"Hi , "
I definitely prefer to have the final exam available on the weekend too due to work and family commitments.
This makes sense to me....I think you nailed it:)
"When I start the video for Unit 6 module 3, which is supposed to be \P-value Pitfalls: Multiple Testing,\"" I get a video titled \""Optional material: Alternatives to Boneferroni.\"" Is this the correct module? I feel like I might have missed something..."""
There are two videos in module 3. You are looking at the second one. Look to the left of the strip along the top of the video. There should be another film icon.
Never mind - just figured it out. It's late! Thanks though!
"Hi,"
I think you would probably need to combine them somehow.
I can only tell you that you should go to the area you are most passionate about.
[ PLoS Medicine Essay: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False][1]
Thank you!!
hello and salam to every one !
A few modules have no quizzes.
"I don't think it's going away anytime soon! I think it does have some place in traditional medical studies as well--it gives some kind of \objective\"" standard by which to judge results. The problem is when it's given more weight than other attributes of the study (study design, effect size, sample size, etc.). Also, it's probably not terribly useful in the case of huge studies that can detect minute differences between groups."""
"There's a great PLoS Medicine paper on this from 2005: \Why most published medical studies are false\""!"""
"The deadlines for submission have passed, but you can should still be able to get solutions for the homeworks."
exactly!
Thanks for providing the link!  This is a great paper!
"Oh I see, we_re assessing the variables vs. day of birth, and that is of course totally random. Thank you for explaining."
Got it. Thanks for the explanation.
"Hi,"
"Ioannidis really *really* got up the noses of some researchers with this (and other) papers. I was doing another mooc where someone raised this paper, and one of the staff responded with a very condescending comment about being careful with the \quality\"" of papers you read."
If there is more than one correct answer you need to select *all* the correct ones. Or you are wrong.
"yes, it is clear now! Thanks."
"http://www.cnbc.com/id/<zipRedac>00879850. This would be a great opportunity for us to analyze and get the real facts, not just what the media reports."
I think we should have more Homework Assignments before submitting the exams.
"thank you, will read. supplemental material much appreciated."
The research material you have provided in your course is quite helpful and because of those papers I find clinical trials much more interesting than genomics. I now do have some ideas of the recent research that is being conducted. Will explore more research papers to gain a better view. Can you please suggest some good journal articles or papers to me? Thanks!
"I understand under the unit of observation the thing that is measured, thus the dependent variable."
I assume you took the square root of your SD formula? Would also be useful if you mentioned which HW you refer to.
interesting how many different ways clopidogrel and ticagrelor were spelt out
"@ 24:31 you mention a lottery example - that of choosing 6 nos out of 1 to 49. The question you ask is \how many different unique combinations of 6 B2173 numbers can you choose?\"" "
"If that is the case, I would like to make a suggestion to make it clearer for students.  At first reading, one might assume you are asking for possible explanations without the actual HIV experiment data.  In that case, there are multiple correct answers as I pointed out.  However, since you are asking the student to compare the actual data to the hypothetical, then a clarifying statement is needed.  Example:"
Agreed... They are confidence intervals similar to the numbers given in problems 4-6 of HW6.
I agree... it should read null value of 1 (for ORs)
correction: it is @ 15:16. comment reg the low PPV of the test
"As others have said, the notion of clinical significance is context-dependent, so I don't think this question provided sufficient information to properly answer the cases. Figure <zipRedac> in this paper (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC<zipRedac>495062/) shows the 4 different possibilities of \clinical importance\"" and statistical significance. In contrast, the course uses the ambiguous \""large\"" effect definition."""
"It is not why I am taking the course, but it would be great if I could get CME as well! Thanks Dr <redacted> for the wonderful course."
"Yes, please tell me which homework you are referring to!"
"ok, thanks."
"On the courseware tab, labelled Solutions."
"That link didn't work for me, but this one did:"
This [article][1] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC<phoneRedac>/) explains odd ratio and how to interpret statistical significance from CI of odd ratio.
"..thanks, Alzheimer's and bad eyes strike again..."
"The phrase 'rule of thumb' very likely has its origins in the building trade, where the width of the thumb was used as an estimate, being roughly equivalent to an inch. In fact, several Indo-European languages use the same word, or a cognate, to mean 'inch' or 'thumb'."
"While term certainly predates its use in terms of domestic abuse, its origins as a marker of a legal right to domestic abuse harks back to at least the 19th century (Robinson 1881). I merely pointed it out as, due to this MOOC reaching an international audience, not all those enrolled have a neutral interpretation of the this term."
"For a result to be meaningful, one would have thought that a test has to be statistically significant before it can be clinically significant. Comment?"
"Thank you for your material, especially the R example code, which has otherwise been sadly missing in action from most of this course!  The paper on p-values also looks like a good read."
"Thank you, Kristin!"
How many days will we have to complete the exam? 
"I am a public health undergraduate from Uganda, did Biostatistics last term and got interested. I guess I just want to acquaint myself more with the subject and hopefully this will help along the way in my career."
The question here is whether the unit of observation is correlated or not.
"I'm very interested in this class, but due to my schedule cannot participate with any regularity.  I'm wondering how long after the end of the course the materials will be available for those who want to work through the modules at their own pace.  Thanks!"
I think it would be a useful addition to warn students when submitting homework if all fields are not filled out.
"Well put, guessing isn't that much fun for me either."
She told us that.
"Sorry, let me rephrase, English is not so good. The term has offensive connotations which originate from around the 18th century. These surface in legal rulings in the 19th century. Again, I merely bring this up because of the international audience that this course reaches and this term is not universally accepted as 'neutral' outside of the US."
Question answered! Thanks
"I was wondering the same thing.  Thanks for finding out details.  If you're right, and it was 2001, then I'm guessing you're thinking about 9/11, right?"
You are most welcome.
It depends on the problem!
Thanks!
Thx!!!!!!!
"It would be great if everyone made their data public. Then it would be very easy to \fact-check\"" statistical analyses in papers!"""
LearnerForever the quiz is the questions peresent after each module( those of 1 or 2 MCQs rather than calculation of the HW)
There is only the option to choose one. Think back to what Dr. <redacted> said about comparing p-values.
"I guessed, got them both wrong.  What were the odds of that?  :)"
Then the wording should be corrected in the question.
There's nothing wrong with the wording.
"What difference does it make whether they are 90%, 95% or anything CI? The interpretation is the same: you have an interval, and you make an inference at that probability level (whatever that is)."
The course is indeed great and this presentation was enormously helpful. Thank you.
"I posted a longer comment a day ago, but it seems to have been deleted (or I didn't hit the submit button!). The 19th century rulings stem from the same myth, likely created by Gilleray's famous cartoon of Justice Buller that I mentioned before. There has never been any such official law of 'rule of thumb' relating to domestic abuse. In fact the 17th century law of 'moderate chastisement' (salva moderate castigatione) never permitted physical abuse, for all that this particular law is still oppressive by more modern standards. Where it is mentioned in 19th century court proceedings is down to the credulity of the persons quoted. This continues today thanks to this myth being repeated time and again without correction. Many languages have phrases similar to 'rule of thumb' which mean the same thing (i.e., a general principle broadly applied). It is not an offensive phrase in English or non-English-speaking regions. In addition, the correct (true) meaning should be abundantly clear from the context. Sorry to go on, but I find the criticism made over this phrase to be pointless."
"Same her, guessed and got both wrong."
"Genomics and clinical trials are not the only places where statisticians are needed. If you think about it, in all branches of science whether you do experiments, case studies, etc, you will have to do statistics. Granted, in some a simple t-test should suffice, but sometimes you will need something much more complicated. I do neuroscience and with the amount of data you can collect these days, statistics and data mining are very important."
I would appreciate suggestions on how to think about answering this question in a study. It is not just the independent variable. What is an alternative question that I can ask to answer it correctly?
1 + 7 + 48 = 56   Unless I'm wrong ;-)
"Hi, Just checked my progress and realized I'm missing week 4 marks despite submitting. The rest are however okay. Anyone else with a similar issue ?"
Last sentence of last-but-one paragraph I meant 'now uncorrelated data'
"Don't worry too much about it, seriously. Nobody gets it at the beginning!"
"Hi,"
"Hi, I know there was some discussion about whether the weekend would be reasonable for the exam submission. I have similar summer challenges as mentioned during the week, so I was wondering if there has been a decision about whether it was strictly Aug 13-16 inclusive, whether it will be available immediately on the 13th, and how many hours preparation and to complete the test do you expect. (Sorry for the preponderance of questions - I just need to rearrange my internet availability and my childcare so that I can get it done thoughtfully and completely in one go.)"
"I think you should have read the text more carefully, sorry. We all make mistakes, don't worry."
Great question. I have wondered too.
It's been almost four weeks since the last update on CME credit for the course.  
"Dear all,"
"Please correct me if I am wrong, but from what I understand, the simulation starts with an *existing* dataset. Say you have n=3,000 vitamin D observations. The computer samples n=100 random samples from the n=3,000 observations and calculates the mean, then it takes another n=100 random sample from the n=3,000 observations and calculates the mean and so on."

"I got this wrong too, using exactly the same reasoning.  Just taking my lumps and moving on . . ."
"Well, first of all the data on the plot includes only a handful of countries with Nobel prize laureates. According to this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country there are 73 countries that had one or more laureate. What about the rest of 196 countries? Clearly cherry-picked data - I think the worst offense in data analysis."
Thanks!
Thank you!
"Learner,"
The second homework question after Module 1 - Part 1 seems to follow the initial examples after Part 2. 
"This is a challenging course (same course I teach to my Stanford students), so I appreciate you sticking with it!"
"In your example, then the unit of observation would be the burns. But it is not."
"Just a bit of fun. The author isn't saying that chocolate is a cause, just that there is a correlation."
When will be able to take the final and when must it be completed by?
Some comment here:
Good one!
One week will be great
Seems the second part of module 3 is a repetition of part 1.
ditto - and I kind of felt comfortable with it as this was indicated on a similar sample type in one of the video examples
I'm a general building contractor living not too far from Stanford.  The poor quality of media coverage of medical research drives me crazy.
Does anyone know where the original article cane be found?
"But if I missed deadline how could I see the correct answers? I don't see the \Show answer\"" buttom as in other (no late HW)."""
"SusanC,"
"Please add the time unit in the quiz question. Days, years, months. I assumed it is months - and that is correct, but I had to look at the graph and the text a few times to make sure it was really missing. Of Course months makes the most sense, but it can be confusing since 30 days = 1 month."
Thanks for the great example!
OK thanks.
"You're welcome, just hope it helped. "
Anything specific to help you with?

"Aha! Oh great, that looks like what I have. Nice to know I was going in the right direction - I really should have more self confidence."
"You are of course correct, I did extrapolate indeed, although it didn't feel correct because I knew the drinking variable isn't a true continuous variable, so you can't just extend the line. I haven't ever dealt with regression of binary data before - add to that the fact I also dry ran through the question without having yet seen the video ;-)"
Thanks for the explanations

This ran in the NYT 2 weeks ago. Especially interesting in light of this class.

thank you so much guys ;)
i_m new in this course. i just want to know more about statisctis apllied.
"I graduated in biology, I'm a PhD student interested in biostatistics. "
The videos seem fine to me! Can you check them again please?
thank you!
I was just making sure that I understood it too..thanks for answering!
"my small mind will think it is a binary variable, either yes or no"
Is there a final exam for this course?
"And the former president's name is \Reagan\"", not \""Regan\"" :)"""
Ok I think we differ because of the statistical test chosen. Question then: Are the observations correlated? I think this will lead you to the correct test.
"since the sample is taken from a pre-determined class (not random), am i correct in saying that the correlation coefficicent and p-value obtained cannot be used to make statistical inference to a larger student population?"
Did you read the syllabus?
"yes, I hate questions that have their answers dependent on the preceding questions. If you answer the first question wrong, your chance of getting the subsequent answers right is negatively impacted. We should have INDEPENDENT questions, Dr. <redacted>."
Patience is a virtue.
"I'm not sure why people just don't answer straight forward questions. + means exposed and - means no exposure. Thus, in the HW problem, in the Toluene row, the third column over has a 9 under Case$^- /$Control$^+$. That means in 9 pairs of twins, the Case twin was not exposed to Toluene and the Control twin was exposed to Toluene."
It won't accept my answers! Technical problem over there! ;)
"well i hope so, but stats is also new maybe a day to remember probability and p values."
Thanks a lot!
"Sorry, I accidentally click the \Report Misuse\"" when I scrolled down the website. I felt really sorry."""
Yes
It really depends on the context!
Thanks for catching!
Thanks
Awesome! Thank you very much!
"Thanks for the reply, Kristin (if I may). That's what I was thinking. (*First*  formula posted above.)"
Can we assume this is the Composite measure?
Thank you! That answers my question!
"Hi everyone,"
"Thanks, I agree this was a tricky one!"
It would be nice if you had put a smiley behind the topic to indicate the irony. You almost scared me there!
Very true!!!
"I had that problem in IE, but now I submit through Firefox. That has worked for me. I am using Windows 8 operating system."
"<redacted>, yes but that would be equivalent to starting a joke with a smile ;-)  if the post was from Professor <redacted>, on the last.hour.of.final, now that would be scary, but funny."
She must have made a mistake. All of the rest of the information seems to fit the slope being .15 instead of 1.5.
When is the next version of this course planned?
"The final exam will be posted 8/5 to 8/16. There should be a formal announcement posted on this now, and look for an email shortly!"
The amount of time that they show alcholic drinks!
Thanks Dr. Kristin for the detailed answer.
Thanks! This really helps!
"Although, as a confounding variable, Don Regan was his Treasury secretary."
"Great lectures,and a great course but with one not so minor complaint: the discussion platform seems to be overly restrictive and not user friendly. Unlike other MOOCS where the **ease** of navigation in the discussion forums has expediated my ability to find great student input quickly, here it seems to take \hours\"" to browse the discussion forum in order to discover those great insights which students add to the course material (and thanks to the many students who have helped me along so far!). Kind of a bummer...but on the other hand I enjoy the \""ticker tape transcripts\"" given to the right of the videolectures because they speed-up gaining access to material of interest to me. Again, all in all I am tremendously impressed by the organization and layout of this course and especially the enthusiasm for Statistics conveyed by Kristin and her coworkers."""
same question here
Thanks for replying back. I will try to work it out that way and will let you know if i could crack it and other questions also.
"I agree with the first post. It's not a question of following some procedure correctly. They are slow to navigate, it's hard to narrow the focus, and hard to browse. The threads are typically only a few posts long. Yes, there are nice aspects such as the link at the bottom of the lecture. But, I think, the difficulty of use leads to less activity."
thanks
"Beyond common sense, there may be published research or other subject matter experts that support relationships between predictor-confounder and confounder-outcome. You can also test to see if such relationships exist in your data."
Does it have negative scoring?
Please refer to the discussion here:
The final exam will be available for you to attempt from 8/5 to 8/16.
Can you please specify the slide you are talking about so I can try and answer your question?
Has the issue been fixed now?
Really folks. The last homework assignment is due on August 13 and the final is due on August 16th?  Do you assume that all your students are doing nothing but taking this course?  Get real and get realistic. You should have allowed at least a full week between when the last homework assignment is due and when the final is due.
"Thanks Raj. So not only is the assumption weaker, but the test is also more robust to violations of this weaker assumption. Interesting!"
The final exam will be posted tomorrow and available until the 16th.  You should work on the questions for the first 8 units for the next several days and keep saving them and then do the last few questions based on the last unit(which should be very few since there are only 25 questions total) after finishing the homework for the last unit.
Thanks!
"I have a PhD in Mathematics and teach. I also have background in manufacturing and have used statistics in that area. I have taught statistics in grad school and since, and probability and statistics was kind of a hobby while I was in school both as an undergrad and grad. I am taking the course to get a view of and some insight into how a specific discipline uses and understands statistics. It helps me make statistics more meaningful to my students (I hope) and broadens my knowledge. I really enjoy her examples and she writes a nice column. I've taken a couple of statistics courses on Coursera. I may take Stat 2 from UCB given on edx as that's the course I was a teaching assistant for while at Berkeley. Not sure I'll have time though."
"It is odd that we get a week for each HW and then 3 days for the final. In addition, at least some of the material will be pretty old and require a little more than usual effort to apply. At least I would expect that for myself."
"I'm thrilled that you have such a specific plan on how I should be spending my time. However for the past 8 weeks we have had a schedule of online lectures and homework (granted they're all there at the beginning but I assumed the idea was to learn according to a schedule to let the content sink in). So, if I'm still working on week 8 homework, and haven't started week 9 and planned to have it done on the due date, your proposed schedule doesn't mesh with mine nor with the expectations or precedents that have been set by the last 8 weeks."
"One way to consolidate threads is to have categories for posting and reading. It definitely does not eliminate the problem of multiple threads but it helps enormously. In a Finance course on Coursera that I took, they had an \Assignments\"" category among several other basic super-categories. When you selected \""Assignments\"" you were now faced with a category for each week's assignment, \""Assignment 1\"" , \""Assignment 2\"" , and so on. When you selected the Assignment you were interested in, you then had two choices: \""Questions 1 - 5\"" and \""Questions 6 - 10\"". When one of those was selected, you found yourself in the belly of the beast. There was typically one or two threads for each question (there were two versions of each question in the assignment), and then many posts per thread as we approached the due date."
"First, you deserve a pat on the back for your tenacity in \working the problem\"" (as they used to say at NASA). Especially as you had already submitted your answer. I sincerely mean that. I was going to do what you did, only before answering the question, in order to sort of confirm my guess but ended up using another approach to, sort of, confirm my guess.  "

"It's very odd to start final before 13th Aug,  due date for submitting homework 9 & allow just 3 days to review previous weeks study material in just 3 days for those students who are following the tentative schedule provided & also finish final ! Overlapping  final with week 9 is shifts the focus . These are very critical weeks of this course , as far as learning is concerned when students revise all course material . Keeping discussion board open during final is another wrong decision . Staff should look into this . **It appears majority of students are not even aware of this** sudden ( Sudden because most are busy doing unit 8 hw and unit 9 ) announcement at this stage ."
Thanks Dr Arvind for telling that exam is going to be loaded today.
"Agree, I have been working on this premise."
or it is an example of an April Fool's Day joke.
"I think we'll have enough time to finish the homework and the exam.  The course was advertised to end by Aug 18, after all. Stay focused and good luck!"
"By opening the exam early, I think they're trying to help out the students who have inflexible schedules.  I don't see why it should prevent anyone from finishing the homework and completing the course according to the original schedule.  The course was advertised to finish by Aug 18, after all, so there should be no surprises here. It's a bonus for us that the exam is open for so long.  Thanks Dr. S. and good luck to all!"
"1:28 Dr. <redacted> is discussing small \samples\"" and the transcript reads \""symbols\""."""
"Hi Dr. <redacted> - I think you have said earlier in the course that you will look into offering CME credits for the medical professional students in the course. I wonder if I can get CME credits along with the Statement of Accomplishment for the course. If so, how do I get the CME credits? Thanks again for a great course. I learned alot and will be referring back to the course materials for the rest of my medical career. :-)"
thank you
waiting for the final the exam...all the best to every one
How do I get access to the quizzes? I can't seem to find where to take them in the courseware.
"Look at the Progress tab above ^^ and you can see your current position. The quizzes account for a maximum of 10% of the final score (and, as you can retake them, everyone who wants should get the full 10%). The weekly Exercise sets contribute up to 45% of the score - drop the lowest score and take the mean of the rest)."
They are accessed from the strip above the videos - the same place you step through the separate sections on multi-part modules.
"I agree there seems to be an error in the video slide. She talks of the equation producing a DSST score but in the video the \DSST\"" score is given units of \""nmol/L\""."""
"I have loved this course. Despite going into this with a major part of my job being interpretation of the medical literature, I have learned a TON.    "
Thank you
Hi! Christin. I wonder is the first answer of question 16 of the final exam is well writen. Thanks.
Thanks. I'll have another think about it before submitting. I'm looking forward to reading the clarification offered by the teaching team.
I was unable to start with your course in the begining and I am very sorry about that but I will try to finish as much as possible it is a great opportunity to learn with the design of the course.
"Oops, sorry. I seem to have nested my question within another question."
"Same thoughts crossed my mind and you put words to those thoughts.Why people are reluctant to help ? I had finished Unit 8 HW last week ,but did not submit ,because I am stuck with question 2 and 13.But looks like I will have to submit by guessing Q -2 and and assuming that Q-13 needs comparing beta values of all the variable in two tables."
Whoa! what a marathon. Really enjoyed the course. Just finish the exam questions. Awaiting statement of accomplishment. Is there anyone in the house who has completed the course?
"I did! The course was great! Kristin is a great instructor and I really enjoyed her teaching style. Hope she will consider offering a course on \Probability\""."
Okay.. That makes sense! Thanks mathdanmom !
Got answer wrong for Q-13.It looks like you have to compare the difference between adjusted and unadjusted beta for all the variable in the exclusively breast fed infant with the DHA group.Though this is not clear in the explanation.
" >. If you have questions or concerns that may give too much away, please email us at: <emailRedac> ."
"I agree, it'd have been nicer getting a bit more time to undertake the final exam, specially for all of us following the schedule."
Looking forward to it!
"Just to let you know. If it wasn't for this discussion, I would have picked the wrong answer. "
Thought that might be the case but wasn't clear. Thanks mathdanmom!
"for people who already submitted the final exam, did you get to know your score right away? I mean I know you can submit each question individually this time so I was wondering if they tell you as you go, if you got it right or do you get to know in the end from the progress graph?"

"No, you can't. However, staff members have said there'll be a new a offering of this course, you'll have your chance then."
"Yes, there was a typo. It is now fixed! Sorry, got the negatives confused while proofing the exam!"
"The final exam should be completable in the August 13-August 16 time frame. We just posted eary as some students finished the course early and a few others had conflicts. So it's probably fine to focus on Week 9 this week, and start the exam when you complete Week 9. It shouldn't take more than a few hours to complete the exam."
"Thanks for the feedback. As this is a new platform, some of the features are experimental. And it's helpful for us to understand what worked and didn't work for the next iteration of the course!"

Thanx.
"Just a few moments ago, I was also able to cross the 60% overall marks while doing my final exam. I'd like to thank Dr. <redacted> for the course and being quite lenient in the final exam as I was quite sacared that getting a sum of 22 in final will not be easy one. But I have done it with quite less effort as compared to what I was expecting. This course was really a great experience for me too as it has provided with a moderate challenge as compared to other MOOCs I had done on Coursera."
"Thank you, <redacted>."
"Thanks Prof. <redacted> for your kind response . That was my spontaneous reaction as soon as I first saw this & before the final was actually posted . As the decision has been taken keeping in view overall interest of wider sections of students , I concur with you ."
You should exponentiate the product of multiplication.
"the videos for week 9,module 3-5 are not working.is there any place else where I can see them?"
"First of all, I really enjoyed this course and I learned a lot! I have taken several stats courses and this is my favorite so far. I have one comment regarding a statement in unit 9 that red meat eating cannot possibly be causally linked to a higher rate of death through accidents. "
"In the segment of video from 10:27 to 10:40 (and again from 13:30 to 13:36), the beta of the logistic regression was interpreted as \there is a 4% decrease in your **odds** of being book smart for every one hour more that you spend on homework per week.\""  "
Got it. Thnx. Will you be sending out an announcement for the course?
i finished ...i got 91% yeahhhhhhhhhhhh...waiting for the statement!
"Not sure what you mean. You say it was submitted. You say it shows on the progress bar. So, what is the problem?"
"I think it means you anwered it right.  You can also check \Progress\"" after each submission.  If the gray bar goes to the top, your answer was correct."""
"If nothing happened, then you were wrong."
"I am trying to submit HW 8 and it is not showing submit. Usually after HW submission I can see the show correct answers, but this time it is not submitting at all."
"Great course! I really love examples from real scientific papers. Possibly the 'take home message' is: 'do statistics for your papers if you are an expert, otherwise find an expert' :)"
"Interesting, thanks!"
"Dear kristin,"
Interesting coincidence.  Thanks for the clarification.
"Ok, I now infer from Q6 that the relevant change seems to be a change of +1 units. Still, it would have been nice to have this specified in Q5."
"Yes, thanks. Needed to leave it for awhile. That leads me to FX Q16 and the odds ratio of 2.44. Clinical significance is difficult for me to determine even though I assume the risk of this cancer is low. This paper leaves me with more doubt about it."
thank you very much for clarifying
"Just want to say thank you to Hut, Raj & Tracy for your comments.  They enabled me to work through the problem correctly =)"
"If no \Submit\"" button is showing and you don't see anything on your progress bar for homework 8, than your deadline has passed and you have already lost the points.  However, the lowest homework score is dropped from the total."""
"Ah, thanks for the clarification."
Glad the course has been helpful! Thanks for the nice note.
Congratulations on a great score!  The certificates of accomplishment will be available after the course ends (give us a few days after August 16 to get these up!).
Very true .
and me also i thank you for this interesting and useful course
Computer science guy right here.
"Thank you guys for your help. What I am exciting about in statistics is the fact that you cannot be absolutely sure about anything _ however, this is also the reason why it can be so irritating sometimes :-) The fact about hypothesis testing is that neither hypothesis is ¡°true¡±. After a test, you end up with a p-value that must be explained. The idea is to keep ¡°significance level¡± low and ¡°power¡± high, and yes, in the most cases, we try to formulate our hypothesis in such way that we ¡°go¡± after ¡°the alternative one¡±. However most importantly is to formulate the null hypothesis based on a clear probability model _ something you can calculate with _ otherwise it makes no sense at all. Anyway, I am still puzzled about the way we can explain p-values. Yes, if a p-value is 0.5, this means we cannot reject null hypothesis. But do we have any other indication? Or may we use the results from the test in order to formulate our next step? Is that a kind of ¡°bias¡±? I think I need to research the subject more deeply;-). Thank you."
R has bundled datasets.
Unit 3 Mod 5. She goes over the conditions there. Very straight forward once you know them.
"I'd also like to request a few more days for the final exam.  I am working full-time next week and there's no way I can finish Unit 9 and the final exam in one week and still take care of my kids and everything else!!!  I was really hoping that the HW for Unit 9 would be due on Tuesday, August 13th, and then the final would be due on Tuesday, August 20th.  I really don't think you have to worry about giving too long of a time to complete the final in terms of cheating.  --I don't even know anyone else taking this course, and I'm far too busy to contact anyone else anyway!  I'd really appreciate an extension until the 20th.  "
You're welcome...
"OK, thanks."
Well i must congratulate the Chief instructor Kristin  for the well constructed course. I never had such an understanding of the course before and this will certainly help me.
hi
"finished, 76%"
"Yes, great refreshing and new knowledge."
I got late on the course through a colleague and got 59% still learned at lot.
"Thanks, that helps."
it means that your answer is wrong
"The course is going to complete and i had attended none of the class as i have registered today only. so can you please tell me this course will repeat again, so that i can start from the starting."
"I got it, thanks"
I really appreciate your response! Thank you!
Also from me a huge big Thank you. I especially enjoyed that you explained most of the content with regard to real studies. I am so glad that I joined this course and it will certainly help me with the upcoming Statistics exam at my university next month :)
"Thank you so much Prof. <redacted> and Team for this fantastic Journey, the incrible job you did and the amazing quality of all your lectures, "
How can you whine so much about a free course?
Congrats to the faculty for putting together a great course. For the first time i 'got' biostats! 
I am very impressed by the contents of this course. I found it lately (may be after Unit 7) and couldn't cover many home works in due time. Although I didn't pass overall but I think I have learnt a lot. Many thanks to <redacted> <redacted> for her energetic lectures. Thanks to Stanford for offering this valuable course for free.
I think that I got your hints. Thanks a lot.
Can you clarify? Thanks.
Exam due on the 16th.  What's the rush.  Is the next run of the course starting on the 17th.
"Ok, thanks."
Because there are staff who run the course and respond to questions. You think they should be available at your beck and call for ever? Unpaid? To someone who can't even post with a nickname?
"Having answered 8/8 final exam questions successfully, and having not yet turned in the final HW, I have made it to the 60% mark. There is still a chance to scrape through to 90% mark - but it will be a feat. Wish I had not made some of the silly HW errors."
"I listen to the lectures, fill out the homework questions and never utilize the staff wrt questions and the like.  I just want a little extra time - the point is to use this class as a positive learning experience which is lessened when rushed."
"Syllabus, 9 weeks ago, stated Final Exam Period: August 13-August 16. We've been fortunate the Units were available ahead of the week scheduled, the final exam posted over a week before it was due. I appreciated all the work and organization Stanford put into this class, and..... their staff have other responsibilities and it's summertime for them too."
Only a few of the questions are from week nine. Just do all the earlier ones now! Thanks Dr. <redacted>. Great course.
"I agree with this. My first MOOC too, although I'm taking two others simultaneously this is my first one completed.  I'm a total newbie, not a mathematician nor a medical professional --- 100 was never a goal for me but very pleased to get in the mid-80s."
What do the (each of them)terms mean ?
"I am also taking 2 other courses on coursera, so I am spread really thin.."
"For more detail on dummy coding in Stata, refer to:"
"Also, I'm not sure whether putting the predictors as ordinal variables adds anything to your logistic regression analysis. It may be possible, but I haven't seen this done. You might try searching on Google or [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) to see if someone has asked a similar question."
Gosh! Was hard to finish it but I finally did it!
"Yes me too, I'm taking two other courses on Coursera concurrently with this one. Spread a bit thin but getting through it. Good luck!"
"Many thanks to those who organized the course, i found it very useful.  Thanks god, I got decent score > 90%.  I am looking forward for more productive courses similar to this one.  Thank you again."
Me too hopefully ( see post above!).
"I think, <redacted> talks about R course applied to medicine."
"Dr. <redacted>,"
"It refers to the drop on DSST or vitamin D, level?"
Thanks!
Thanks for the input!
"I wondered why some of my correct answers were marked wrong on the final, but on reviewing those questions I discovered that the answer I had checked was not the one that was graded!"
"Search on it here in this forum.  Other people have already commented on that particular question. There is already enough information there to get you started, and to solve it."
Look for mathisfun.com(even Harvard use it) and Wikipedia or write an specific question on This forum.
https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Medicine/HRP258/Statistics_in_Medicine/courseware/dfc813ce3d0b441c<phoneRedac>1e341add2/f<zipRedac>3682dcc52f493c91dae28db2<zipRedac>0c3ed/
"While earlier in this thread I agreed that the due date for the final was not timed the way the HW had been, and that I expected to have a harder time answering questions on old topics, thus requiring more than the usual time, I don't think the process ended up being the problem I thought it might be."
"Congratulations to Dr.<redacted> and her staff. This was very tough for me but I did come out out in a better place. I still struggle with probability (easily confused) but I have greatly improved understanding of statistical significance/clinical significance, ability to read statistical findings in both tables and graphs, and selection of appropriate statistical tests. I found the platform easy to negotiate once I made a point of exploring all sections. I enjoyed the immediate feedback. I found I could learn as much from reviewing the correct answer responses as I did from the videos. I followed the discussions and appreciate the staff's patience with impatient students. I will achieve a certificate (a reward for working so hard) but even if I did not, this course was worth all my time and effort.....thank you."
"You need to watch what you do with the mouse/scroll. It's been a problem throughout - the focus stays on whatever you clikced last. If that was your answer choice, unless you then click elsewhere (somewhere blank for example) if you scroll/page up&down  you will move down the answer choices -  and you might not notice! It must be a simple programming thing to fix, but hasn't been yet (happens in Coursera courses too!)"
what else you taking?  Any that are hard & fun at the same time?
Agree with you 100%. A continuation of this course by Dr. <redacted> would be great!!!
"Great, great course, but I would differ about the final point made that the correlation between red-meat consumption and higher accident mortality must being spurious."
Always scroll with the mouse clicked on an area  to the elft of the vertical line on the page or else a radio button that you did not choose can get selected unwittingly.
"I agree!  I would love to keep up with the trend of homework being due on Tuesday at noon and have the final due on Tuesday, August 20th by noon."
> a) Logistic regression is used to show causal relationship
"Yes, thanks for your reply."
Thank you so much Dr. Kristin <redacted> for such a eye-opening and thoroughly enjoyable course. 
Will the solution to the final exam be provided? I think it should be so that we could be aware of our mistakes and could understand points we were unable to.
I think new data from health conscious/low risk individuals such as those doing Paleo diet would be interesting to observe given that that this group's lifesytle such as risky behaviours would be different than those mentioned in the above study!
Unfortunetly I checked my progress today and I marked 89%. I missed the distinction for 1%.  I should not hurry up to answer the final questions.  Bad luck!
"Yeah there was a tricky few questions there ... one in particular! Very sneaky! But ... just shows we should always check and double check, and make sure we read the question well. I found I had the right answer, i was absolutely sure, 100%. I checked and checked. 100% sure ... then I submitted it ... and got 0! ... A few minutes later I clicked why! Rats! Fortunately for me it was the only one I got wrong. This course has taught me a lot - one thing it has taught me is to trust my instinct/intuition better - on the homeworks, the ones I got wrong were the ones I doubted myself and changed my mind on."
"Yeah that 'simple' probability bit has always had me, for all the courses in stats I have done, it was always my thorn! Glad you got a certificate!"
agree
"I would also really like such discussion. It's difficult to know who to turn to when faced with problems in publishing like you mean. And there seem to be such a wide variation in standards acceptable by different publishing houses. As Dr <redacted> has pointed out, mistakes get through the system of even the biggest journals (BMJ, NEJM etc). I work at a small house and practically alone, which is a huge responsibility. And it wieghs on me heavily that I am sure to be missing finer points of stats analysis. I have already posted on a couple of things that have troubled me and the feedback has been very helpful. This course has helped me very much. It's brilliant that Dr <redacted> has a lot of interest in the publishing side too. Perhaps another course could be Stats for editors or similar."
"I often get articles with data on protein/gene expression in tissues, often from microarray or other section analysis. The data are usually continuous. This includes data like the result of the HER2 test, p53, and Ki-67, in correlation with other clinical parameters. I understand why having gone through multiple tissue sections and grading each for the proportion of positive cells as a continuous parameter you might want to class them into several groups of different expression. What I don't really get is why take all that information and boil it down to just two groups? I understand in some cases this is so we can have a cutoff value for predictive purposes etc, but aren't we actually losing information by doing this? Doesn't this reduce the power of our analysis? It often seems researchers are looking for cutoffs and somewhat ignoring the true value of the data they have gained. Or are analyses that might use such data just too complicated if many groups are used?"
http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/rice/Stat2/The%20Hunk%20Differential.htm
"Sometimes the yes or no value is what is actually needed.Is p53 positive or not, is the patient Her2Neu positive or not so oftne that outcome is used in a binary or categorical manner(In fact  the standard way to see for eg Her2 Neu is percentage of cells positive and usually the grading is done in 10 or 7 groups  from weakly positive to strongly positive so you cannot be more accurate than the accuracy of your data."
"Students dedicate time to learn the materials, so it is not completely free for them."
Here you can find another quite neat explanation of Bayes Theorem dealing with coin flips:
"Evgenios and ChrisG123, Congratulations, You are SS - Statistical Supermen. Until now, I belong to another cohort. Today August 11, I don_t know how to answer that examen and I haven't done yet the 9th homework. In a near future I want to be as you, as our pretty and agreable PhD Kristin, as hundreds of our brilliant statistical cybermates, who are obtained their excellent grade."
Congratulations Ujwala. Best wishes to you and yours
I agree too. I propose to include in that course Biostatistics with R and Deducer. 
"There's no way to say for sure that something we see in the medical literature is a chance finding or not. We cannot even calculate the probability that it is a chance finding (we can estimate this probability with a lot of assumptions, but there is no way to calculate it directly). So the best we can do is recognize that there are certain patterns that are indicative of chance findings. These are the patterns I've been trying to illustrate. Hope that helps!"
"Yes, you need a final 90% or more to earn distinction."
"The archives will remain up indefinitely, so feel free to take the course at your own pace. We will offer it again in as an official course likely in the spring if you want to earn a formal statement of accomplishment."
"Thanks for the nice note, Michael! Glad you enjoyed the course."
"Congratulations on finishing the course. I'm so glad it helped you to \get\"" statistics! :)"""
"Thanks for the nice note. And we will leave the archives of the course up, so feel free to take it as a self-paced course."
We'll leave the course archives posted for anyone who would like to take the course as a self-paced course.
Thanks for pointing out--there may be a typo.
I have submitted final but have no feedback.I'm waiting on results before submitting last HW.Do I have to wait for results?
"Thanks for the praise, Sheridan!  I'm glad to hear that I was able to hit the right balance of enjoyable and rigorous. I hope I can get many doctors to enjoy reading data tables ;)"
Thanks for the link!
 Feel free to email specific questions about the exam to: <emailRedac> 
"Congratulations on passing!  This is the same content I teach at Stanford, so if it wasn't hard I'd be worried ;)"
Glad you enjoyed the course!
This clearly means I am destined to remain poor!
Thank You so much Dr.Kristin. I appreciate your involvement in the subject and helpfulness in all aspects of coursework!
This is great--and not at all far-fetched from what really happens with medical studies!
Here's another great XKCD:
"Typos that we identified in the quizzes and homeworks were corrected, but we haven't yet fixed the typos in the course videos or decks!"
Thanks for pointing this out!
"This is the best Stats course I have taken so far. I have taken Stats for Math major in college and Udacity's Stats 101. My college Stats class focused too much on Mathematical proof and neglected application. Udacity's Stats 101 is too basic. Stats in Medicine has the nice balance. I love the optional modules and readings. Thank you professor for sharing your great articles. Otherwise, I have to pay for them :)"
"Whew...managed to answer all exam questions correctly and now I am sitting at 90%! There were 2 questions, that I could have made the wrong choices. So I think I just need to not mess up the last homework really badly..."
That would be great! Thanks a lot.
Turned in final HW too. Done!
thank you
"I would suggest the excellent Mathematical Statistics Bootcamp I & II at John Hopkins. it covers essentially the same ground as the present course, in a little greater depth. It's a little more hard-going but seems pretty manageable so far (part I started 3 weeks ago)."
"I just wanted to thank everyone who created and ran this course! I had a wonderful time, and the course was super-informative. This information will be put to good use in the future :)"
"Great advice for people that are feeling anxious about the deadline (ie, the final). Thanks for sharing....:)"
"Hi,"
"Dear organizers of the course, could you please tell me which module I should listen to again to answer this question? \In including continuous predictors in the model (e.g., age, length of ICU stay), what assumption are the authors making?\"""""
Hi I just finished the final Exam and was wondering when will we be able to see the resolutions?
"Yes I went through that too.  But I was determined to get the exact answer and I did in the end.  I think you're on the right track.  I read everything in the whole course that I could find that was related, and in the end I found everything I needed to answer the question with confidence."
Me Too. 
"Hello, I just tried and this is still not resolved. I am also unable to download unit 8 solutions."
"Unit 9,Module-3"
Me too!
"Dear Dr <redacted>,"
"Professor <redacted>,"
IMHO those possibilities are just what would be included in residual confounding factors.  Or maybe eating red meat just makes a person a more aggressive driver ;-)
"This was an excellent course all around.  For me, if it had a slogan, it would be, \the red or blue pill\"" - it really changed how I view medical research, now I look at it with trepidation - I'm not sure if I can fully trust a research again.  - I'm worry about medical research - probably part of the reason why we a are still taking Tylenol for a common cold ;) "
Thanks Prof.<redacted> for such a well drafted and excellently delivered course.You made me work very very hard to earn that 60% but now I regret having missed that landmark of 90% had I not messed up those decimal places in my homeworks.
That indicates your answer is wrong.
"Writing in the Sciences. Another course led by Dr. <redacted>, I missed the first offering, but I've read it'll be available again soon."
This worked for me too. Thanks for the tip!
Can you give us some time on this? We will upload the solutions soon!
" As far as changing address, I would contact the administrators about it at <emailRedac> . It seems like they will mail certificates, but I am not sure. "
"Many thanks to Prof. Kristin and TAs for their and time efforts. It was indeed a great learning experience going through this course. The practical examples and succinct nature of the course makes it an ideal learning. Prof. Kristin, you are really a wonderful teacher and I am sure you have conveyed passion and motivation to everyone. I really enjoyed your style of teaching. This is the best bio-statistics course I have ever taken.  "
I totally agree. Thanks for all your work!
Thanx a lot for your precious information.
It's nothing big comparing to effort you and other staff spent preparing this great course for us. Thanks very much!
"Great thanks to professor <redacted> for this enormous course, it will be great to track and study her offerings."
Three comments about the technology supporting this course:
"Yup, I learned this the hard way!"
Brinnell the points are 0 or 4.
"Ah, that makes alot of sense. Thanks."
"Thanks for posting this!  If only we had had access to them sooner.  Many of the slides are indeed unreadable on the videos, except for those cases where the teacher zooms in.  (And in the Unit 9 lectures, she didn't zoom in.)  Fortunately, the PowerPoint slides are a lot more readable, though they sometimes have issues with the hand-drawn annotations not showing up in the right place (perhaps because I am using LibreOffice Impress to display the file)."
Thanks for the kind words!  I'm glad the course was both challenging and enjoyable!
agreed. I enjoy Dr. <redacted>'s lectures - just awesome. Thanks
"Dear Professor,"
"Thanks <redacted> and <redacted> sir/mam for your guidelines.But i have already tried Mcnemar's test and also the Risk difference test but in both cases (infact in all other cases which i tried) i got wrong answers and so being pissed off ultimately marked the wrong choice.However, i have completed my course with a total of 79%.I hereby want to convey my heartily thanx to Prof.Kristin and other TA's for providing us with such a great course and i must say that i could not have utilised this time(having just passed my high school 2 months ago)in a better way.I am really grateful to all of you."
Kristin
"Greets. Dr. <redacted> has said it isn't, there'll be a new offering that will give you CME credits though."
" Hurrah!!!, completely joy, very very excited. My end 75% is the tag, the reflex of the polite and permanent preoccupation of several great personalities. This year will be unforgetable for me. I am standing on the shoulders of the biggest statistical giants _ The pretty Professors <redacted> <redacted> from Berkeley university and PhD <redacted> <redacted> from Stanford. I am indebted to them. I stay on those shoulders because of the big effort done by my Cybersitemates, mainly for their permanent help chiefly to <redacted>, <redacted>, <redacted>, <redacted>, <redacted>..., and all of you, who every day have given to me the neccessary courage for doing things well.  Thanks to all. For me it_s very important to be in contact with all of you. My E-mail is <emailRedac> . I wish also to Thank to Berkeley and Stanford universities. They are taking part now of a big revolution that is introducing new educational paradigms. I also wish to express my gratitude to all Staff members of that wonderful course, for their fine spirit of cooperation in helping to learn that very difficult subject. The course is exciting marvelous, very  useful to all as me who are working at the health sector. Medical world has radically changed with the becoming of computers and the web. We have passed from Statistical Descriptive Medicine to the Evidence Based Medicine. Now we are living the era of Inference Medicine. Course is very well designed. It is of very considerable value for those who are doing medical research. Each module begins with the appearing of the lovely and beautiful PhD <redacted>, pretty dressed, with the prevailing fashion style in nowadays time and the neccessary voice for learning statistics. Course needs the 10th unit, where she will appear in red clothes. Course is complemented by additional readings. How and where Can I buy all <redacted> book. It looks wonderful."
That is great!
Thank you so much Dr. <redacted> and Team! 
"Sadly, I can't claim that excuse. On two questions I simply didn't read the answers closely enough and on the other wrong answers I just... didn't get them right!"
"Professor <redacted>, thank you very much for the wonderful course. I was always afraid of statistics, but your course made it easier on me to understand one of the most important aspects in statistics. Thank you, looking forward to register in other courses for you."
It means that your answers were wrong(You can see a scoreas a grey line  and increase in your score if the answer is correct.Another thing is refresh the progress chart page and the scores will refresh if your answers are right.
"This was a wonderful course, thank you so much for making statistics so accessible!"
I know!  I got an 89.1 -- so close!
"I wish to thank Prof. Saisani and Stanford University for the second time (The first was when I took \Writing in the Sciences\"")as well as the staff for this course. I also appreciate that the lectures were given in advance allowing me to work on some units (instead of withdrawing) before my busy 5-week vacation."""
"Are there any specific ones you want? I tried to reproduce most of them in R for my own practice, but there were quite a few..."
"There are MOOCs like this on Coursera, they just mention the prerequisites beforehand, they even refer you to take the prerequisites on the same platform from the same or different university."
"Thank you so much Dr <redacted> and the TAs for such a great course! It provided a very good overview about the core aspects of statistics in a condensed and interesting manner - I felt the overviews about odds ratios, RR and the like, as well as the different types of studies used was excellent and really cleared up something that has been confusing me for quite a while! Given the time restrictions, I think the modules on the statistical tests are terrific - perhaps there could be additional detail added in a \Statistics in Medicine 2\"" course? :) "
"Hi,"
Thanks for your answer.
thanks jadetine. what about changing mailing address .how can i do that ?
translated by google?
brinnell!! if u get any details about changing mailing address do share here. Thanks
One of the best online courses I ve come across. Superb presentation & teaching method. I really enjoyed & learnt a lot. Reading medical literature wont be the same after this. Thank you Dr Kristin <redacted> & your staff as well as Stanford University for bringing this course to us.
yes I was munching on chips and having a good time with some of them; others I had to open two screens while simultaneously taking notes.  
I totally agree with what was said above: this course was terrific! It was extraordinarily well suited to my background and to what I wanted to learn. Thousands of thanks to Dr Kristin <redacted> and her staff!
A second course would be fantastic. Perhaps a Unit about bootstrapping and/or propensity analysis could be included?
Thank you! I am taking classes online to restart my brain after a 25 year break. I am trying to keep up with my 15 year old who is starting PreCalc in September. What an incredible resource these online class are for everyone! :)

"You can copy the questions to Microsoft WORD. Select the lines, right click, find copy click on it. then, paste on an open window of WORD"
Dr. <redacted> has stated that course materials will be permanently up for us to go back and review them whenever we need to.
I agree. Thank you!
I have really enjoyed this class. Thank you so much!
"Thanks, Manuela! Glad the class was able to fill in the practical side of statistics."
Congratulations on passing the course!  And glad to see that it was interesting enough for someone coming from a background outside of stats and statistics!
Thanks for the nice notes!
The course materials will remain up so you can do the course at your own pace.
Congratulations on a great score and hope your baby picked up some stats along the way :)
"Thanks so much for the nice note, and congratulations on a great score!"
"Sorry guys, that means the answers were incorrect"
Credit? For what?
"Hi staff,"
I agree. It will be a pleasure!
"I want to add my appreciation as well to Dr. <redacted> and her staff. This was the second awesome course from her (I had previously taken her writing course on Coursera). I can't say I am confident with all the material you covered in this course, Dr. <redacted>, but I hope to keep working on it and get everything clear in my mind. What was special about this course was your attention to interpretation rather than just calculation (like many other Stats courses do); generally it was the questions related to interpreting certain values and deriving conclusions that were harder for me than the ones involving calculation of something like Z values or confidence intervals. I hope that going over all you essays in the Optional Readings section will make be better able to derive the correct conclusions from data. Thank you so much for a brilliant course, and I look forward to more courses from you."
"A big thank you to Dr. Kristin and her colleagues. I work at a clinical research unit in Saudi Arabia, and this course has permitted me to see some of the errors that researchers make and those that I failed to identify. The course was well structured and suited for students and professionals interested in statistics. As a working mum who is constantly distracted by her toddler and six-month old baby, I managed to score 85%, which I believe is because the material was well organised and Dr. Kristin did a good job in explaining the course materials. Although the unit on probability was really challenging, and I would also say frustating, she tried to make it as simple as possible."
Please read my first reply to the original post.
"So basically we're missing the green ticks / red crosses. No big deal, but I think Rudaina's comment \it should at least indicate that the mark is 0/4 ( so I know it is wrong)\"" is pertinent."""

Hopefully another class by the professor, regarding scientific writing is going to begin soon."
"Hamburg, Germany. Danke f¨¹r die super tolle geleistete Arbeit!"
"phew.......it was challenging but made through 91% with 4 more questions to go. Thanks to all discussions which help understand the things which we might have missed. A load of Thanks to Prof. Kristen for amazing lectures, slide, material.......You really made statistics which I had always feared a fun and interesting subject with such deep understanding of concepts. Really deeply appreciate the way you make things so easier to understand with loads of examples from real life."
great course!
"Tbilisi, Georgia. ?????? ???? ???????!"

"As a volunteer in the field hospital, I passed on Wednesday the hardest 11 hours in my life in Rabaa  Eladawya Square in Egypt  sieged by bullets  and over 2600 dead bodies in the greatest massacre ever known in the Egyptian history  when the army and police abrogated the peaceful anti-coup protests. I'm still shocked and don¡¯t believe I¡¯m still alive, but I find it is a must at the course end to present my thanks to Prof. Kristin. I really appreciate her simple, elegant, enthusiastic and passionate presentation of the course material, and I'm proud to be her student. Many thanks."
"Greets. A quote from Dr. <redacted> regarding your query. \A CME version of the course will be up in September where you can get CME credits for your work.\"""""
That means you got the question wrong.
"Muchisimas gracias! born in Argentina, now living in New York. Kristin you did a fantastic job."
"Thanks so much, Andy, excellent detective work! R is such a great program, I too would just like to get a handle on it. We work mostly in SPSS, which is fine, but so different. SPSS is like Windows and R is like unix raw, I'd rather have my hands on the data ;)"
"Thanks so much, Prof. <redacted>! It was truly a pleasure to take this course and, for me, it was the first time I felt like had a firm and thorough understanding of the subject matter. Many thanks, this will be extremely useful as I transition into a new career."
I feel so sorry for you and your country
"Thank you, Dr. <redacted>, for the clear explanation. Very helpful!"
i was wondering if i will be able to return to this website after the course if i ever want to review a section or something.
Wonderful teaching and thoughtful material
From the Calendar: FINAL EXAM AND ALL QUIZZES DUE
"I passed (66%) which is all that I wanted to do.  I am a retired US judge and have no particular use for whatever knowledge I might've gleaned from this course.  I have a sense of the concepts more so than any proficiency at performing actual calculations. I earned an A in a statistics course over 40 years ago and boxplots and whiskers had not been invented yet (1960s).  As a litigator later on, I worked on class actions in the employment discrimination context, but we engaged statisticians and other experts to do the heavy lifting.  I could read abstracts and grasp what these experts were telling me, so I could argue my points in court.  I actually spoke with William Castelli of Framingham Heart fame to try to get him to be an expert witness in one of our lawsuits. I consider my passing as monumental an achievement as passing the bar exam; many of the answers were very close and often came down to two very possible choices. To me nothing was clearkly obvious."
Hello
"Just noticed about quizzes, where are they?"
"OK, now I see all the quizzes and don't think I can finish all of them from the FIRST unit ;-("
thanks got it right1
Like units of some sort?
"Moscow, Russia - ??????? ???????!"
"with your score from the final exam, you should be able to get a pass if you make the bonus 10% from the quiz. That would already make 49.6. how did the homeworks go? Week 5 to 9 should give you a shot at 5/8 (62.5%) of the total homework score. Assuming a similar average score as in the final exam (84% without the bonus question) you could get 0.84 * 0.625 * 45% = 23.6. That would come down to a cummulative score of ~72%. Did you miss the quizzes? I don't know whether they are still available."
"According to the Progress bar, I am missing a score for Quiz 44.  Somehow I inadvertently skipped it.  How can I determine which unit/module this quiz is associated with?  Thanks."
Is there a typo here?
"Dr. <redacted>,"
There was definitely a typo in my answer.  /sigh
don't give up quiz has more than one submission option so you keep on trying till the right answer
"I didn't do as many homework assignments as I could have. If I had, I would have completed the course with a certificate. The final exam, I passed - Yay :-) that made my day!! Thank you Dr <redacted> and colleagues for a great class and even though I was sick for a few weeks with Lupus issues; I could go back to the lessons and complete the final with a passing grade :-)"
"Saint-Petersburg, Russia: Bolshoe spasibo, (Great thanks)."
I have average of 88% from final exam (39.6% of 45%) and I have 10%  from quizzes. But unfortunately just 8.6% from possible 45% of homework! Since 
Many thanks!  That's exactly what I needed.  I'll try to grab a few final points.
Why does the Unit 1 Module 5 Quiz have a deadline that is 19 hours earlier than all the rest of the quizzes?
And Unit 9 module 2 :(
dear dr.saini
"La Punt Chamues-ch, Switzerland: Grazcha fich! (Rhaeto-Romanic)"
Do you have a hundred on your quiz? go back and resubmit till its one hundred %
"From Kolkata, India - "
I saw the same thing but I think it was still calculated at being worth 4 marks as I had 6 questions wrong (5 after dropping 1 of them) and I still received 80%. It would've been 77% if I had only received the 1 mark for question 20.
"This was a very challenging course for me. I've had so many tests, formulae and interpretations going through my head, at times it was really hard to focus on just the info I needed to solve a particular bit of homework and the final. It was a fast-paced course too, I found, with a lot of information. But I made it to the end and passed. Wished I had gotten 90 but I ended up with 81%, not bad for a guy who has never been to university, I guess :) I'm very appreciative of the the amount of work Dr. <redacted> put into the lectures. At no time did I ever find the material boring and concerning the subject matter, that's probably pretty amazing. Thanks!"
"From Beijing, China, ???"
Very good online course. Thumbs up!
Me too Just finished at 4:30 am my local time............
"thank you for the great and interesting course, just waiting for the certificate"
"Actually, if you go to Unit 9 Quiz 2, you'll see that there is no submit button, and the due date is different from the other quizzes, as I specified in my original comment."
I'm having the same problem as well
"I just wanted to say that this course has really exceeded all of my expectations. Very well done. I loved how it was formatted. It made it very easy for me to learn on my own time, yet was structured enough to prevent me from procrastinating. I especially liked how all of the lectures had text that you can read along with. I understand that this is most likely for the hearing impaired students, but it was very useful for me as well! I also really enjoyed the little quirks, like how it would spell out \cough\"" or \""inaudible sounds\"". Don't fix those! They made me laugh. I also want to echo the other student that commented on the \""In this module\"" intros. I loved it! "
For some odd reason I am not able to submit the answers in quiz 2. I thought I was late to answer them but I was able to submit answers for the other quizzes
"Buenos Aires, Argentina, Gracias!"
thank you
"Dear Dr <redacted> and course staff,"
It does seem that a few quizzes have an earlier deadline for some reason. Remember that each quiz represents only 0.2% of the overall mark so unless you are really right on the threshold between pass and fail or pass and distinction then I really wouldn't lose sleep over it!
"Huge thanks from England too. I have been looking for a way to gain a better understanding of many aspects of statistics in medicine for many years. This course has been so much more helpful than trying to battle through a textbook. In particular, it has been a joy to finally be clear on which tests are used in which situations - something that can be so difficult to pick up from other sources. I particularly appreciated the information about the non-parametric tests as these are sometimes ignored and sidelined in other places whereas I come across them frequently in my work."
Why is it a different deadline for this particular quiz?
"I'd like to say thank you to Dr. <redacted> and her assistants for this course.  The teaching style was excellent, and I was able to learn a lot.  I ended up scoring 100% on the final exam and a 97% overall in the course.  I live in the US and will be attending medical school next year.  I'm sure this course will help me at medical school as well as with the research I'm currently doing."
Congratulations on such a good score despite starting late!  Glad you enjoyed the course!
Email tech support if you are unable to access your grade etc. due to this change. They should be able to help you.
You're welcome!
"Great question. I would love to be able to reference these materials in the future. Do we know approximately how long we will have access? I am likely going to download each module video when I get the chance, but probably will not have the time in the next couple days."
I do the same expecially since I do most of the video watching on my smartphone so I can split both ppt and video on my galaxy note screen if required9or lese high resolution videos occupy a lot of space on my SD card !)
Congratulations on the distinction! I'm glad the course has helped you see how fun statistics can be! :)
"Our thoughts and prayers are with you. We can't imagine what you're going through. And it really hits home to learn that one of our students is right there in the midst of it all. Thank you for taking the time to post to the forum, and stay safe."
what about a 89.6?
me too :(
"Great to see a high school student in the course!  Great score, and hope you rock the AP exam! Let us know how it goes. And hope to see you at Stanford :)"
Thanks for the nice note!
"Yes, the tests we learned are applicable to medical records and healthcare claims data. Remember these databases may have huge numbers, however; so p-values may be less relevant unless dealing with rare diseases."
I'll make sure the quiz deadlines are set correctly--there may be an error.
This was an error--this quiz will be open for an extra hour so try submitting again.
"Sorry, I will check into these and change deadline to 1pm today. so you will have an extra hour for submission. A few were set wrong."
Congratulations on a great score!  Do keep practicing. There are numerous introductory statistics books you could get problems from; or just through Google!
Congratulations on passing!  Statements of accomplishment will be available through an online link soon.
Thanks so much for your nice note!  Glad it was a good combination of structure and freedom. And I like reading along text too for learning!
Thanks for putting in all those extra hours. And I'm glad you found the course fun and were able to complete it!  Congratulations!
Thanks for sticking with it into the late hours of the night!  Congratulations on passing!
"Often you apply more stringent criteria to account for multiple testing. So if you are running five tests, you might use a cut off of .01 to keep the overall type I error rate at 0.05."
Glad to have some high school students in the class! I'm so happy that this class has helped you see the beauty of math--and hope you will continue to take math classes!
It will be good if solution to the final is provided especially I was unable to do correct and understand Q. 21:(
"Dhanyavad,"
"I'm more than happy I joined this course. I found it really challenging but had a lot of fun as well (I loved teasers!). In the end of the day, I have no doubts - it was worth, so much worth. Thank you for your effort!"

And quizes Unit 7 Module 1.
"Thanks for this, Zagreb! I'm amazed you were able to complete the course with four small children! My two (3 + 6) keep me on my toes!  Thanks for persevering and for the kind words."
You are even greater now in my eyes! greetings to Your children as well:-)
"i am from France, and you know we don't speak english very well, but with my friends (me and 3 friends ) we works lot (google translation help us a lot...lol) we watching the videos repeatedly, it was very clear course, and change our view on medical litterature. thank you very very much to you and your staff for this course"
Hello
Seriously? Did you watch all the videos?
"Dr. <redacted>,"
When will we get the certificate. I haven't received it yet. Thanks
When will I get the certificate. I haven't received it yet. Thanks

"Hello Prof. <redacted> and team,"
Yaa It's same to me. I enjoyed too much..............Thanks Prof <redacted> <redacted>
"Yes, I note that about q20 as well.  I am not sure if that affects the final score.  I got 45 out of 45 from the Final Exam.  So I think that may not affect the total Final Exam score."
"I guess so, instead of baby Mozart it has been Dr. Kristin lectures . . ."
"I note that in the last hours before the deadline that I was not allowed to submit Quiz result as well.  I am not sure how long that last, but later I was able to submit again.  Maybe some adjustment should be made due to time loss as a result."
I have saved my answers for the final but just realized I passed the deadline for the submission.  Is there a way that my answers still be graded?  I already have achieved 48% on the progress.  I would really appreciate if that can be done.  Thank you very much!
Email tech support and will look at your case.
"I think the algorithm rounds up, so you should make it with 59.5% or higher!"
"I don't have a follow-up course ready, but a number of students have posted to the discussion boards about some other upcoming MOOCs in statistics that may cover additional topics. So search for these!"
"Yes, the algorithm rounds up!"
"If you got a score of 0/4, this means that they were incorrect. We will post an answer key shortly. Glad you enjoyed the course!"
"I missed to submit my answers yesterday i messed and missed a great opportunity in my life, for which i cant get compromised or forgive myself.  Thanks for Dr. <redacted> for her good guidance, I miss you all."
"And thanks, class was a blast and a challenge!"
great! Thanks for the info...so no worries about the address.
thanks...will do that
They're redoing it in the spring
I really enjoyed this course and congratulate Professor <redacted> on a job well done.
"Check coursera.  The course was offered there last September and is still archived.  If not the same course, it will probably be a similar format."
I agree this was a good course.
"To the Statistics in medicine team,"
"Dear Dr <redacted>,"
Here another Peruvian reporting my gratitude for the amazing learning experience. 
"Wroc?aw, Poland. Dzi?kuj? bardzo :)"
"Moscow, Russia. ??????? ?? ????."
"Dear Kristin,"
"I just saw that and was going to post it myself. xkcd is very popular among geeks, Dr. <redacted>, and since it's licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License, you can freely use it in your course, too. Here it is online:"
Thanks for your response!
"yep, more or less. "
"hello, answer questions"
"Sir, this is amazing. With the amount of introductory statistics courses available online these days (*Statistics in Medicine* being, perhaps, one of the most accessible for the layman as well as complete), we'll soon reach a critical mass of students of all sorts of backgrounds. Courses on particular aspects of statistics will soon make a lot of sense; a \statistics in law\"" course would, no doubt, be fascinating, considering what you just said, as well as the legal examples provided throughout *Statistics in Medicine*. Maybe this will inspire Prof. <redacted> for future Stanford courses..?"""
When will I know the result?
It means you got it wrong.
I am highly grateful to everyone for creating this course. I have a much better understanding about all the conceptual based areas. Just want to say that it has really motivated me to do PhD in Biostatistics now. 
"thanks a lot, Dr. <redacted>! I know these answers won't increase my final result significantly, but I wondered if I answered right :)"
Thanks a lot Dr.<redacted> and the rest of the teaching staff.
Hopefully something that might be addressed in the next rendition would be a downloadable pdf with the answers (I forgot to suggesst it on the survey!). But for now you will have to watch the video ... but you can scroll thru it fast!
Anyone got any suggestions?
"These sort of problems are indeed fascinating, and of course which is correct is often debateable. And we so often have small values, even when starting off with say hundreds of patients."
Cheers!
"Hello, "
How much *fluency* in English *writing* is needed for this course?
"I want to first send a huge Thank You to Dr. <redacted> and her staff for an amazing course! You were very engaging and it was obvious that you are your team put your heart and soul into this. I took an undergraduate and graduate statistics course, but because this was presented in the framework of medical statistics, I learned a lot of new concepts. It has made a big difference for me, and I am so proud to put on my resume that I completed a statistics course from Stanford University."
"thanks for the link, don't know how you found it."
Please Dr. <redacted> include in that post course. Programing with R
"I had actually wanted a little more specific information, viz. the length requirement, if any, of the two short papers.  For instance, a 10 page science paper might be short, but I wouldn't want to be saddled with two of these during a holiday period and with strict deadlines."
It was great doing this course. The weekly course information updates and discussions promoted a group feeling. I am thrilled at completing the course. Thanks to Kritin and team.
Thank you so much .... It's the best
"The team have said that the course will be run again. As to changing the pass mark after the event, that seems unlikely."
"Susan, thank you for suggestion. Just pointed to two obvious flaws in site design - "
Agreed
"Overall, this was a very good class that provided good"
"I thank Dr.<redacted> and her staff for the excellent way in which this course has been constructed and delivered. It covers both the theory and practice of statistics in medicine, with attention to details and without any mistakes. This was the best course I attended and completed successfully online."
I earnestly thank Dr. <redacted> and her team for making this course possible. We are indeed proud of you.
"Hi,"
Perhaps it's just you.I think we earned it by studying for the last 2 months.Dr. <redacted> was an excellent teacher too.
"No, it's not just you. The post is typical of the \I am just here for the certificate\"" crowd. It's all that is important. And as for putting it on a CV asap. Depending on your circumstances, a mooc certificate on a CV won't carry much weight. "
"Hi everyone! Have any of you received the link to download the certificate of accomplishment, or at least received the e-mail about it?"
"AbbyNormal, a course like this may help you to refresh your stats but help you little with Big Data. If you want more R practice check the course \Quantitative methods in public health\"" from Harvard on this same platform Edx.org, it is almost the same. For Big data, there is a class in coursera.org almost to start (from IIT) and later \""Computing for data analysis\"", \""Data analysis\"", \""Machine learning\"", and \""Probabilistic graphical models\"". There are two courses from the University of Washington in coursera. I audited all these courses and I recommend all to everybody interested on Big Data. I hope being of some help, and thank you for sharing."""
"The writing course will likely be less time consuming than this course. There will be weekly homework, but it will be varied: three editing exercises (editing sentences and paragraphs); two short papers (500 words max); and two peer review/editing assignments. I estimate 4-8 hours per week vs. 8-12 was my estimate for this course. Hope that helps!"
"They've been there; if you can fill out the pre-course survey, that does help us. The pre-test is probably less relevant now!"
We will post the online link soon. Give us a few days to sort out a few manual review requests and get everything together!  I'll post an announcement/send an email when the statements are ready.
I'm so glad you found the course relevant!  Signs-up for my writing course are here if you're interested in a a very different topic!: http://sciwrite.class.stanford.edu
We will send the link when it's ready. It might be a few days.
Thank you Dr.<redacted>.
http://clauswilke.com/blog/2013/8/18/common-errors-in-statistical-analyses
Dr S. You are a born teacher. Thanks for the great course.
I am also unable to view the post-course assessment and survey. Kindly ensure that the link works.
Yes this was a great course.  I no medical training or experience but now find I can spot likely analytical flaws in the medical research reports that appear regularly in the popular press. Really appreciate the use of real research to highlight the correct and incorrect statistical analysis of the results.
"as given in the Aug 17th email, http://sciwrite.class.stanford.edu/"
"I had downloaded them directly from the journal's site for free, so this shouldn't be a problem."
"Gee, I guess your throwaway remark at the end congratulating the instructor makes up for the rude tone. This might be a MOOC but it's still a college course, not some Insta-cert machine that spits out qualifications While-U-Wait."
What is wrong with you people? I was just asking for an official date in case there is one.I thought I missed that while I was reading on the site.
"I suppose that if you were unhappy with the **free** course you could always pay the $40,000+ Stanford tuition and get some real educatin'."
Best statistics book EVER ! ! ! !
I'd pay it but even then they wouldn't take a loser like me.
"Dr <redacted>,"
"Could the instructor recommended statistics books on statistics methods that have been mentioned but not going into details?  By that I mean methods like non-parametric statistics, power calculation, sampling, GEE, survival analysis, Cox regression, etc.  Thank you for a great course!  I am looking forward to your reply!"
"@Laurencew, that is not the attitude.  One should always be open to suggestion and try to improve!"
I agreed with Scarlette on that.  The bar should not be lowered to accommodate the students.  Just think how many people have bigger disappointment in life than that.  Just think of Michelle Kwan who never got a Gold Medal in the Olympics!  Many Olympians are also SO CLOSE to winning a Gold Medal!
Agreed. Rules are rules. Life is full of frustrations and missed opportunities. It is a sign of maturity to accept the inevitable.
Dhanwad! dhanyawad! Thanks Prof <redacted> & your team for your hardwork & dedication! India.
"We will likely offer it again next year. I don't know the exact timing yet, but stay tuned."
"I use as text's in my class Paul Allison's book on survival analysis in SAS, Twisk's book on longitudinal data analysis, and Vittinghoff's book on regression analysis (linear, logistic, repeated measures). Hope that's enough info to find them on Google/Amazon!"
"I think all points of view have been explored thus far. Some are pleased, others complain. Now..."
Thank you!
"Thanks for mentioning the Harvard class; I hadn't heard about that one!  I already took \Computing for Data Analysis\"" (Roger Peng's 4-week introduction to R), and \""Data Analysis.\""  I'd love to take Andrew Ng's \""Machine Learning\"" class next, but the last time I checked, it wasn't yet being offered again yet.  I also absolutely loved the University of Washington \""Computational Finance\"" class, though I didn't have time to complete it.  I also hope to take \""Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 2\"" from Johns Hopkins on Coursera.  (The first class was pretty good.)"""
Dr. Kristin Thanks for your comments.
"Guadalajara, M¨¦xico. Gracias Dr. <redacted> ."
"I would like to give a massive thank you to Stanford University, Dr <redacted> and all staff involved for providing such a great course. This course will aid me in life. Thank you for your commitment to education."
Everything will remain up indefinitely. Please let us know if there are any problems with access.
"Thank you for a great class experience - learned a lot!   Happy to have had the chance to dust off some of my older stats books, engage in conversations about stats with others, find new sources of recommended further research and learn."
any body received the link yet ???
any body received it ??
<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Syria
Wholeheartedly agree :) And so would my patients if they knew!
DITTO. This course has rekindled my interest in statistics which is sooooo important in evaluating medical literature.
Me neither

"I think that apart from a very few where the wording was just simply ambiguous in terms of the english sentence construction used, most of the quizzes did test you on whether you had understood the underlying broad concepts on which test to use or should have been used and were sometimes quite subtle. Some were quite straightforward to complete where the concept was simple, and helped to boost your confidence ..perhaps deliberately... :).  My view."
"Hi,"
"\How easy or difficult was the course?\"""
"Yes, that's a good point; this should be worded more specifically. I think this was meant to ask about the course material (lectures and problems) as opposed to logistics and time management. But it would be good to be more specific in the question next time!"
Thank you very much for your answer and for the kind help!
"Thanks, Prof. <redacted> and Steve for answering and asking my question. "
Thank you for the prompt response.
Thank you your timely response.
Thank you for your timely response.
"Thanks for the post! I think the last example of material at the link brings a very good point. As applied to human drug studies, the parallel is that all the humans are very different, and there could be no (or vanishingly small) direct correlation between the fact that you take drug and medical effect. But as you start averaging, and use very large groups of people, you can start seeing trends (even tiny). I guess the conclusion is that the drug is not doing any good for you personally, but is of some merit for public health (financially optimizing national health care budget). Please notice that the bird example has a large number of observation data points analyzed (<zipRedac>0000), so statistical power of such study is big, that's why the trend is visible. "
Thank you for your response
"Dear Prof. <redacted>,"
"Very well put Sheridan. AS one of the \passing\"" students I really enjoyed the entire program. For you 67 people who got 100%, please don;t take this the wrong way but I hate you all (ha ha). "
"I beg to differ, there could very well be a causal link here through the parasite toxoplasma gondii. People who eat a lot of red meat are more likely to get infected with toxoplasma, since red meat is one of the major sources of human infection with this parasite besides cat feces. It has been shown that people infected with toxoplasma have prolonged reaction times (making them more likely to get injured or into a car accident) and it has also been shown that victims of traffic accidents have a higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis."
"I found that, overall, the question style and design was appropriate. Questions did not always simply call for a regurgitation of the presented material (now I've written it that seems a slightly unpleasant phrasing - sorry) but sometimes required us to demonstrate understanding of the principles by applying them in a slightly different way."
Holiday and Very Happy Greetings from Colombia!!
Thank you arsang.. If I will need them I will try but for now I do it very easy and fast in Statistica.

" This might be too late, but I think it would be nice to start a stat club where we can discuss an article a week - I think this would totally be a great way to learn stats in the real world.   For example there is a new article about coffee and mortality and its in the media, but when I took a look at it - I recall the professor talking about residual confounds for the cox regression and I realized that the article might be flawed but would like to discuss about it with others to confirm.   Anyway, if you are still here and like to join please send me an email <emailRedac> the said article is here: http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/webfiles/images/journals/jmcp/jmcp_ft88_9_1.pdf"
Dear Dr. <redacted> greetings
That_s a really good idea!
na gode. thank you from nigeria.
"Lahore, Pakistan. ?????"
That is an interesting idea - especially if there is staff input too.
"Hello Dr. <redacted>,"
"Same here! I have not seen any word resembling \pass with distinction\"""""
Same here!
mine also doesn't mention any distinction !!
"mine, too!"
"I also noticed no mention of distinction on the certificate, but just that the course was successfully completed."
Who should be emailed to ask the query about it?
"Check on your dashboard. Under the course you will find a link \Download Your PDF Certificate\"""""
Ditto; I worked hard and got a 99% (just shy of the elite 67 who got 100); but no distinction for me either. I wanted to show it to my mom to prove I had made something of myself :)
"I passed with \Distinction\"" but really am not concerned about what the certificate states. If anyone wants to know your \""grade\"" just tell them."""
Posted on the main login page.
I loved the course and I also worked hard for the distinction. It was a motivator in learning. I would also like to see 'accomplishment with distinction' on the certificate. But I guess it is the learning that is the most important here!
i also noticed the same on my certificate no mention for distinction
"Dear Staff,"
Same for me...didn't get my distinction
"Why \elite\""? Are you sure such a small fluctuation can't be due to... chance? :)"""
"Hi everyone,"
"Thanks for the wonderful classes. I think if I show this certificate anywhere important, I would feel like wearing a free slippers I got from Niagara falls to a party..

"I kinda agree with Salmkk - what exactly is the point of emphasizing that this was a **free** course?

So that I could watch the video lectures even if I have to mute my device for some reasons. Or a lecture note with explanation of each bullet point...
true...but then you have to go to youtube page for this video not directly on this page right(_?_?`)

"Try to turn that disadvantage into an advantage. Think of it this way: you are in a position in which you know exactly what it is like to not understand a sentence due to complicated sentence structure. Perhaps this means your initial attempts to write information-dense sentences will be more clear than a native speaker's, who can rely on cultural knowledge of ambiguity and context to more lazily construct a sentence."

"The model answers are really quite good--even as a native speaker, I would have to work over the example for quite a while to get such nice, dense sentences. As long as you address the points in the prompt as well as improve on the sentence (you should be able to tell with a quick read), I say you've done your job."

Obviously English is not my mothertongue and even not a second language so I allways feel difficultiy when I need to write something in english. I hope this course can help me to avoid some mistakes.

That is why the sentence needs editing ;-)

The same in Poland. I've been studying English at the University and in classes on formal English students were told to avoid using to much verbs as well as to use passive voice. These were supposed to be the indicators of formal language. The same applies to use of personal pronouns.

I've found that single word answers do not require capitilisation and punctuation (eg. entering 'lacks' gets you the point but 'Lacks' or 'lacks.' won't) whereas marked sentences need capitilisation and full stop (eg. 'He lacks something.')

Hi Dr. Kristin and everyone:
Come on! Just a hint: I think it'll be easier to take out the head phones at the end of the videos out rather then have someone to edit the very nice videos.
"Luckily, I had no such problem with any question. If something went wrong, I did that wrong. Quite interestingly, I did both units without listening to lectures or reading slides while still getting excellent scores. Had I read at least slides, I might have ended with 100% perfect scores."
Pretty cool to meet people from all over the world. I'm in Switzerland!
"That is hard to do at 2x playback, the end comes abruptly. And maybe this could be considered for the editing of the upcoming lectures."
"Also, and I am sure we get to this later in the course - for a manuscript for a peer reviewed publication,  we were **taught** to use the passive voice in the materials & methods section....?"
"I have the same problem, but it is normal among non-native speakers. Fortunately, google is a great help nowadays (but yes, the experience could be arduous sometimes)."
So am I! Where are you from and which motives did you have when applying for the course?

"Dear <redacted>, why do you think you were taught wrong? Only because the professor told you what you wanted to hear? Because now you are allowed not to use complicated passive structures? I wouldn't be so quick to admit the professor's point of view. All in all, it is not she who would approve your article in some journal. I guess, a great number of them do not share the idea of simplification of your scientific text."
Hey Ana! I hope I can ask some questions!

I only found the quiz and homework. But I never found essay. Can somebody help?
"Hi,"
"Yes, I wrote \Anti-inflammatory drugs may protect against the onset of Alzheimer's,\"" which is similar although more wordy."""
Thank you Gift. Now I have a clue and a clear idea about it. 
"Hello, Fellow. "
I think it has a stronger meaning. e.g. environment affects gene expression. Does it impact gene expression? I would not write that too often to 'wear out' the strength of this word.
Greetings!
It worked fine for me. Make sure you double check your answers!
"I have answered in a similar manner, and got marked as <b>correct</b>. The problem may be that the answer must comply to the English language rules completely, so things like <i>first letter in a sentence is capitalized</i> and <i>sentences must end with a mark (.,?!)</i> could be important to the grader script."
"I think the same. I'm from the field of Social Sciences, so the sentences are just too complicated for me, even the model rewrites..."
"I wrote neonates, as well."
Hey there! I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Delhi..this course it so exciting!
In the 'course info' menu you will find this:
"Yah, I'm having the same problem, no link to download the video. Teacher can you please include the link for download?"
Hello everybody!
"I think, yes, because such a structure sounds quite natural in English. I was surprised that our professor didn't cut that part of the sentence."
"Hello everyone, I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Ghana. I am a journalist and an author who has just been employed as a communication officer for an NGO which deals with forestry conservation in Ghana. "
"Hi everyone,"
"I agree since \requires\"" may give a different idea which is not expressed in the original. The idea of using verbs like \""involve\"" sounds good to me and maybe others like \""entail\""."""
"Hi, Ruggiero,"
The last questions were indeed too complicated.
Hello to Dr <redacted> and to Everyone!
"Dr <redacted>, Thanks so much for this great course and your welcome message!"
Let's slightly change one on the examples:
"If you can list the homework/quiz questions you are talking about specifically, I'll look into the issue and try to fix it soon!"
We should have the download links up soon.
"Apologies, but you won't be able to load the subtitles on VLC! If you open the text file, you'll notice that it contains a transcript of the lecture, but no timestamps."
"The essay will come up in a couple of weeks, you can ignore the cross for now!"
The 'Final Submit' button is for students to confirm their answers before final submission. 
"Apologies for that! Luckily, there are almost no questions in future quizzes/homeworks that ask for free text answers to be evaluated by the automatic grading system."
"You'll notice that this question is marked for self-assessment. This means that you will need to compare your answer with the model answer, and give yourself 1 point if you think that your answer improves the original, and 0 points if not. Your answer does **not** have to be identical to the model answer for you to get the marks!"
"Kristin and Sergio, many thanks for ideas with 'involve' and 'entail'! I agree, 'requires' does not fit well and can change the main idea of the text."
"I also thought that, but then I thought: what else could we refer to?"
"That's weird! I retried Quizzes 1.4 and 1.5, and I don't see any issues! Please double check that the answers you submitted are actually right - you can view the correct answers by clicking on the \Show Answers\"" button."
"Apologies for that! Luckily, there are almost no questions in future quizzes/homeworks that ask for free text answers to be evaluated by the automatic grading system."
"That's weird! I retried Quizzes 1.4 and 1.5, and I don't see any issues! Please double check that the answers you submitted are actually right - you can view the correct answers by clicking on the \Show Answers\"" button."
"I passed the class (barely) but I got above 60% for my final average. However,I have not received a certificate..."
"Hi, Carlos! Nice to meet you! :) I am a first year Master student in Biochemistry and Molecular biology. My great desire is to improve English writing and reading skills as well as to communicate with new people from all over the world :)"
That's not actually fully correct. 
"Hi, Marcus! Nice to meet you! I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, a first year Master student in Biochemistry and Molecular biology. Best wishes from Ukraine!"
"Dear Kristin,"
"Dear Yuliia!!! Nice to meet you! (^_^) Thanks for such a kind opinion about my major! So am I impressed by your area of interest! It is really applied and close-to-medicine science) I wish good luck and interesting issues during your work! Best regards, <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>!"
"What is the difference between the button \submission\"" and \""final submission\"" in quizzes. Should I press always the final submission after the submission?"""
"As you say, the lowest mark will be dropped. The cross indicates the score to be dropped and, as all are currently the same, it defaults to the last assessment."
"Hi, I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from India having a masters in Biotechnology . This my first course online. It is exciting but I joined late. Can anyone guide me how to answer quiz as I am unable to access that module or provide me an email of anybody to whom I can contact? Looking forward to hearing from all of you."
i agree
You do not need to submit twice. *Final Submit* merely indicates that you are on your last chance where a question allows multiple submissions.
"Dear Prapti, I think you should contact Dr. Kristin for the help. Are you using the chrome browser? Don't worry, you will get an answer soon."
"I have many redundancies in speaking that I cringe at in writing! When I see the closed captions of my speech, I immediately want to get out the red pen. :) I have not yet successfully trained myself to self-edit while speaking; I have to see the words written down before it registers with my brain!  But it's something I'm working on now that all my spoken work is being closed captioned. :)"
"Hello everybody, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Mexico City and this is my first course on line.  I need to write journal papers to get my PhD in Computational Sciences,  so i hope to improve my writing skills."
"Use of the active voice makes authors 'take responsibility' for the action in their sentences, and more frequent use of 'We' and 'I', often missing from passive sentences. "
"Pdilidc, don't worry about this! I'm not a native, my country also provides British variant. I use 'to' and prefer to do this further. Fully agree with mooncat!"
"I don't know if they have changed anything, but I used a verb in 2.4B and it was marked as correct."
You can look for a persons who likes the same science topics as you and exchange your texts with them. 
"Hello everybody, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Brazil. I work with clinical research and I'm in charge of all the writing  in the research center as well. I believe this course will help us a lot to improve our writing skills! It will be a pleasure to work with you all!"
"I've also reacted on something similar to that, during the \Practicing cutting the clutter\"", particularily the example about IQ tests. The author of the text may actually not be 100% sure of or promoting the statement of what IQ really is, and what it really measures. But the author may still want to contribute to the discussion by making research trying common ideas on what it does."
"Thank you very much for the first \correction\"",you are right,I changed the sense of the original statement."
"Such phrases can be used to defend an argument where no solid proof exists and rhetorics is the only thing to rely on. But in \writing in sciences\"", you won't need cheap rhetorics; you'll probably have tons of sources for citations if you're not writing a pseudoscience article or allnighting for an assignment next day."""
"My Name is Bud <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, and I live just south (and slightly left) of Nashville Tennessee in the USA. "
A google calendar is a must. I follow several courses online. This is just getting impossible to track dates...
I agree too. I was a bit unconvinced. I have also seen the author chopped many of the sentences too harshly. I think the author is aggressive on may occasion. It looks to me more about saving space than saving the context.
"I know earlier this week I was able to get to the quiz, logged back on, everything's updated.  How can I get to that and open up the quizzes for each presentation?"
"It is a funny thing as single author. There are all different characters in science but I think it is the polite way to go with \we\"". You might have been inspired by your colleagues and professors and they might have helped to set up everything around your actual experiment (material, study design, revising the manuscript etc). And even if you did it all by yourself then your name will be listed as first author which transmits the information that you most likely did all the big parts. And because there are only so few cases where one really did everything I think it is generally advised to write \""we\"" to not sound too posh. But this is just my \""humble\"" opinion ;) "
But my answers are exactly the same and I got full credit although I never forgot to put a full stop at the end.
Imagine if we marked on a map all the countries represented in this online course!
I don't know what the correct answer for Quiz 2.4 c is either. The window doesn't show it up.
"I'm loving the lectures, but sometimes I think if these \simple writing\"" will be accepted, as we see lots of papers and publications full of useless words...hope someday people notice that less is more."""
Hello
"Hi, I am amazed with this course. Thanks for organizing such a course. Special thanks to the tutor. The most captivating sentence i liked in this class- \cut words ruthlessly\"", because i generally never do that. It also amazed me to know an interchange between a noun ad a verb could make sentence go worse. I bid adieu by saying \"" Learning is always a good process and i enjoy the same with this class\"". Thanks"""
Could you please tell me where is the Quiz of 1.2?
How nice to meet a Brazilian friend here! I'm sure this is going to be a nice experience for all of us! Good luck you all!
I met the same problem and I think teacher's answer makes sense. Thanks!
"My 1.5 response shows \saved but not submitted\""."
"If you read through the introductions thread someone offered an alternative for countries banning YouTube that works in all cases. If I can find it before you do, I will post it."
I am very excited about the course. thanks
"Wait it does I though it would be wrong as a bad student would be inappropriate (\ Butler English\"")"""
any feedback
"I felt in a similar way. It seemed for me that the rewriting was too raw, like if I wasn't being introduced to the subject, but more like if they were just throwing all information at me! I imagined someone really nervous trying to shout all he/she has to say in order to get this sacrifice done as soon as possible..."
"Just my two cent: if you submit an article to a journal, and the capitalization is incorrect or punctuation is missing, then it does not matter if this was just because Word did auto-capitalize poorly.  Seriously: the quiz is about proper writing, of course capitalization and punctuation matters!"
"I think young students are encouraged to get very technical from the very beginning of the career. But later, as a researcher you end up reading only those papers who presents the ideas in a clear way, and many times you said to yourself \Aaaah simplifying the whole paragraph what he means was...\"" . So a clear writing could be the initial step for more citations."""
"Admittedly slightly off topic, but \EEEK!\""   In your reply in the parenthetical after (1) there's is a grammatical error some non-English dominant students might overlook--\""your 'part...'\"" should be \""you're 'part..'\"", right?  BTW your explanations IMHO always strike at the heart of the problem; keep everything simple, all that is necessary and only what is necessary (seems I heard a version of this decades ago as to mathematical proofs.)"""
"Hi everyone, I'm a senior undergraduate from Peking University, majoring in Machine Intelligence. I come to this course, with the hope of improving my English writing, not only scientific ones, but also in other areas. I'm highly addicted to online learning and have achieved nearly ten online courses in coursera, edx, and etc. I'm now working at EECS, UC Berkeley as a visiting student researcher."
"And what about a 'weak student'? It's not very common, I think, but I did find it in several sources."
Guilds have almost always resisted transparency. Sounding 'scientific' as defined here sounds similar to obfuscation.

Welcome Prof.Yassen.
Teacher will explain about it soon I think
"It's similar in Poland... They teach us to use passive voice (though the senetnces should be rather simple), especially in case of formal texts. But we learn British English and this course is American (am I right?) and maybe that's the difference..."
Could you please provide a link to download module 1.7?? Thanks in advance!
Hi Pamela and Milka! I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I'm from Brazil too! but i'm living in Portugal. This is my first online course ;) I'm enjoying a lot and learning as well.
"In my opinion, English we often learn in high school is little bit different from the one using in academic writing. Frankly speaking, use of concise and brevity phrases is really necessary in scientific papers. We are not writers. :)"
It's only one question right? thanks
"Hi Prapti, Puru,"
"Its great to see such comments posted above. To be frank even i felt that sentence is not that great, but honestly speaking i could not re-write perfectly. "

"When I was in Elementary school here in California, (quite some time ago), the way we were taught is the form that you are familiar with.

Is it really that much to ask that you capitalize sentences in formal writing?
People write sentences without periods and expect to be marked as correct?

"I work in the pharmaceutical industry. Part of my job is to author technical documents (procedures, work instructions, etc).

"I have had the same problem, I answered all the questions but the 1.11 to the 1.16 are not counting as submitted. I don't know why..."
"I think the underlying problem is that quantitative scientists are too afraid to use personal pronouns where they fit only as subjects in their reports. They believe that personal pronouns will drain their study of objectivity---its life blood--- that their peers require to judge the studies as groundbreaking ones. They simply crave approval, not clarity or objectivity. If you want to stand out, break new grounds in science, and let your reports benefit the world, write in active voices, write clearly, raid your writing of clutters, and let it be simple. Those are elements in a writing that leave an impact on readers."

Hello!
"Hey guys, i cant upload my answers of the homework of unit 1... I check the pacific time here http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/ as recomended below, and i still missing 4 hours before 19:00! what do we do????"
"Oops, sorry! Didn't realize I could reply to the parent post from the bottom of the page."
"Well, the course description says Homeworks 1,2 and 3 account for only 20% of the grade. Assuming you can submit the next two homeworks on time I think you will only lose about 9-10% of the grade depending on how much you score. To get the Statement of Accomplishment, you need to score 60%, so you're still safe. You probably won't get the distinction though, since that requires you to score 90% overall."
I've resubmitted my answers for questions but they are not showing recorded and I'm only at 3% out of 100%.
oh no! I thought it was 19:00 . . . 7pm in Chicago.
Hi I have taken all the Quizes prior to midnight on Monday Sept 30th (only my homework was late the next day)
It looks like a number of us were confused by the time zone. I also read it to be 7 p.m. and had to look up the meaning of UTC. Unfortunately it was too late by then. Is there any chance we can still get credit this one time?

"It gets that \cost-effectiveness\"" aspect in it, which I missed, but now see is cruicial for the sentence."""
I find it odd that the controversay over whether Data can also take the singular of the verb has been overlooked entirely.  I am also surprised no-one has posted on this before.  Even the Wall Street Journal now allows data to take the singular of the verb in certain circumstances. http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/jul/16/data-plural-singular

"I understand that it¡¯s better to write in active voice, don¡¯t use ¡°there is¡±, ¡°has not¡± and so on. But it takes so much time for changing even a simple sentence. I have to submit my manuscript as soon as possible, and I spent 1 h to convert two (!!!) sentences from passive to active voice and eliminate nouns, which can be verbs. Probably, these sentences became more readable, but I don¡¯t have so much time and patience to do this through all text. Probably more practice needed, but againÿwhere to find time for that"

"In conclusion, the early initiation of parenteral nutrition to supplement insufficient enteral nutrition during the first week after ICU admission in severely ill patients at risk for malnutrition appears to be inferior to the strategy of withholding parenteral nutrition until day 8 while providing vitamins, trace elements, and minerals. Late parenteral nutrition was associated with fewer infections, enhanced recovery, and lower health care costs."
If you read the syllabus it states the first essay opens in week 4.
"Hi,"
"The first essay assignment will go up next week. It will be due at the end of week 4. It will be just 300-500 words in length, so it shouldn't take too long to complete."
The essay assignment will be up next week and will be due at the end of Week 4 (it's essentially Week 4's homework).

"Hi Kristin, I am getting more nervous as we proceed with units 2 onward. Unit 1 was a good introduction and I thought I was on the right track; however, I found myself editing everything I read henceforth, thus it somehow cause some delay in my daily work and routine.Unit 2 is a bit tricky, I am amazed at how you edited that  report on cockroaches  and wireless devices, my attempts at editing it came nothing close to that.  Clearly there is more to writing in the sciences than what I have been exposed to, and at the standards presented in this course, I am more nervous to start writing my thesis report."
"Thank you for showing us how to shorten the first sentence in introduction. However, I have a feeling that the previous introduction might be more defensive than the one after your editing.

Most scientists don't intend to obscure their writing but rather most are to used to speaking and thus writing in their own technical scientific language. Scientists need to be more aware of the broader audience that may be reading their article. Hopefully this class will raise that awareness.

"I don't know what the context was here, but there are cases where 'to+verb+ing' is correct, although such cases are not often used. The examples are 'I object to smoking here' or 'I'm looking forward to seeing you'."
Thank you very much.
You are really amazing.
"Thanks for the information and putting tougher  a wonderful course together. I am a grad student currently writing my thesis, 1 manuscript, 2 abstracts, 1 poster so going through all the material really helped me out here and that is why i was excited enough to finish it so fast. I also did your stats course earlier in the summer and found it to be equally helpful."
"I agree with what my colleagues said especially this is my first online course in my life & I was afraid & hesitated at the beginning, but now it's growing on me! I love this course."
"I absolutely agree. I was raised in California and have excellent reading, writing, and comprehension skills in English, but I too am having a hard time with these re-writes. Some passages do not make sense at all and I am having a difficult time determining what it important and what is a type. Some of my responses were completely off. I agree that there should be a bigger passage provided and we should be asked to edit a part of that passage."

"Week 3 announcement says the deadline for submitting essay is Oct 25.  The essay can be revised and resubmitted based on peer feedback, but again, by Oct 25.  But the deadline for peer review is Oct 29.  Should not the date for resubmission be after the deadline for peer review?"

Same mistake too!
Just to add another note of disappointment regarding missed deadline for Homework 2. So please let me know whether I can make it up and submit it.

Hi
"I am Chinese too. When I think about it now, it seems we put whatever is more important in the beginning of the sentence, be it the object or the subject of the verb. When subject comes ahead of the verb, it natural anyway. However, the unique thing is, when the object comes first, the sentence is turned into an active voice by using another verb to drive the noun form of the original verb. It feels very natural too. For example, \samples are treated with ethylene prior to... \"" is turned into \""samples uses ethylene treatment...\"". When I read the second construction in Chinese, I'll just pickup \""samples\"", \""ethylene treatment\"" instinctively. Forcing the sentence to go passive would be really bizarre to me."

"Yeah, sorry, but the loooong part on the Red Sox was kind of boring for someone who doesn't know anything (and doesn't want to know) about baseball, someone like me...

"It is not a technical problem. You can select a score by clicking anywhere over the entire point description to select the point value. Since this is the case, we find students often make point selections or sometimes change existing one just by clicking other around on the screen to scroll or move around the page. The system is designed like this for accessibility reasons so it is important to check back over both your scoring and grading before you submit your feedback."
"Okay, thanks. I just must have forgotten to add scores for myself."
That is disappointing. Did you use some sort of plagiarism checker or just copy/paste the text into a search engine?

"Hi, "
this is probably where you will find your graded essay - I submitted mine yesterday and can see it there but it has not yet been graded. grading is down for maintenance.
Uptil now i have completed first 3 units . in home work my overall progress is 96% but in quizzes my overall progress is only 31% and my total progress is only 22%. Is it OK or is it too low and should i open another account to improve my score because i think my average is low because of my quizzes in unit 1 and 2.
And I bet it's not just medical professionals that do this! ;)
"Yes, this is a great suggestion!"
"Hello,"
So welcome!
Thank you Professor <redacted> for clearing this matter!
"I think it is okay. I had 100% in all of my quizzes, except in one that I scored 50%, but my average is 49%. My guess is, the average is calculated based on the total (including the quizzes that I have not yet attempted)."
I hit the submit button before quoting the references for the article that i submitted as my writing assignment 1. Is it possible to do it again and submit?
This example -- even with the extended setup -- is too culturally specific for international students and non-fans to appreciate.
I've noticed that in section 3.3 (parallelism) the video ends but the subtitles go on with o a lot of extra examples. What happened to the video? Was it intentionally or accidentally cut?
I completely agree! I've taken classes where many of the videos are only 3-5 minutes long. This is especially frustrating when upwards of 30 seconds both at the beginning and the end are an introduction and summary of the material.
This thread makes my heart grow warm. So many published papers¡ªthe vast majority of which received public funding-are in fact inaccessible to the public!
Apologies for the wait. It should be up soon!

I agree¡ªthe explanation almost reaches the 1000-word mark (and 5 minutes). I just skimmed through it on a 225% playback speed because for someone who¡¯s not a sports fan it was not worth it spending so much time on a build-up to a single example.

I agree with my mates. This is my first experience with MOOCs and it is being really fruitful. I find it useful even when using my own language -Spanish- for the sake of brevity and clarity. I am really grateful to the team.

I have sent my Writing Assignment. In progress section I have now a gray bar. I suppose It was graded by peers review. To complete my work I must grade four others ones but I don_t know where are those writing works. They aren't in the dashboard's assessment panel section. What should I do to obtain them?
"@donj, Try using other browsers. I am using google chrome here and it works just fine. All the best!"
Although I have at least an educational background in global health and health promotion I am also struggling with the biological examples which might be especially because English is not my native language. But apart from this I really do love this course!
"Thank you for the suggestion. It is right that there should be a split in paragraph. As taught in the lessons, there should be more white space and also one idea per paragraph so that the readers are comfortable with the message conveyed."
My page too shows the same message. so hope it is down. Let us wait.
"Everyone in life experiences headache, because it is common pain symptom with many causes. In 1988, International Headache Society (IHS) categorized these causes in two groups: Primary headache disorders _ fundamental problems like Migraine and episodic-tension-type headache ¡ªand secondary headache disorders which are consequence of an underlying condition, such as head injury, brain tumor or systemic infection. Beside IHS (broadly recognized system) comment on other classifications would be appropriate if epidemiologic advantages are available."
I thought of the same thing. But the next question is wont the original essay be counted in the 500 word limit?
"Classic epidemiology and clinical epidemiology are two types with same methodologies but different objectives. Classic epidemiology studies etiology of disease in whole population which helps to find associations among casual factors that play role to prevent the disease. Whereas, clinical epidemiology evaluates prognosis of a disease in patients¡¯ population, that is, it associates the outcomes: sign, symptom, test result or disease with probabilities."
"Hi, I fully completed my Homework 3, but i got not a full grade (100%), only 96%, may I ask please why? "
"Hello all,"
I have already submitted my writing assignment but do not manage to peer grade other assignments. Every time I click on the menu a warning message pops up saying
"Hello Joanna,"
OK. This does not sound very fair as I have seen some posts where it seems that some people do manage to peer review already... Let's wait and see what happens.
"Dear Kristina,"
"I find these discussions very interesting and helpful.  My edit to this question was also very different from the given answer.  I think that part of my problem is that my personal writing style is just plain old DIFFERENT than Kristins! Although the exercise is there to help us shorten and tighten paragraphs I strongly feel that a different answer isn't necessarily wrong and that we all have a different style of writing.  Keep you chin up and definitely give yourself credit if you've shortened and clarified the original writing.  My \take\"" on the revision included some modifiers (like 'extensively') because I felt that they were important.  See what you think:"
Any updates on when this will be resolved? I think this has been down since Saturday now.
"All of homework 3 and part of homework 2 are self assessment. After you submit your answers you should see a model answer appear below the answer box with choices: \my answer improves on the original\"", \""my answer does not improve on the original\"". You have to choose one and submit."

Same here. I'm doing well in the course but did not realize the second week homework deadline was updated to the same as homework 3. Usually each subsequent homework is due one week later than the previous one. 
In the same boat. Please extend unit 3!
I am one hour late.....
I missed the deadline too because i thought I have until the end of day to submit all work. Please extend the deadline.
I wish I could finish Homework 3 today. Is there a way to make up for the lost points through an extra credit assignment?
some is here!
I just missed the due day of homework 3.

"The course is currently running on OpenEdX, not Coursera."
A recent published paper is great.
"We don't have the exact due dates yet, but the second essay will likely be due the week of November 5. The third essay is an optional revision and will be due the last week of the course. The final exam will be available for several days during the last week of the course (it will be 15-20 multiple choice questions and should not be too time consuming)."
"I also missed. Though I was still at 11:58 as per my desktop clock, the server didn't accept my submission. Due to the clock skew, inadvertently I missed the deadline. Perhaps the server should allow 5 minutes of tolerance to accommodate such clock offsets. Next time I won't extend this close."

Hi Dr <redacted>
"Hi Everyone! This is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Bengaluru, India. This platform for learning skills pertaining to effective writing looks really great. I will see to take as much advantage as I can out of the course. But since I just missed earlier some units, have to catch up really fast in coming days! Hopefully I will get some essential tips about research writing even if I may not able to get a certificate of accomplishment."
"Dear teachers, as all my classmates of this discussion I've miss the deadline for homework 3. I wonder if is possible to extend the deadline."
"Dear team, "
"Hello,"
You'll find it in the tab Courseware > writing assignment 1 > Peer grading.
"**Microsoft One Note** is an essential tool to organise literature, ideas etc. Personally, it has saved me a lot of time searching for information in papers as it is easily searchable and user friendly."
Really? I've never used it. Do you use it only to organize your ideas? Thanks for the info.
Thanks. I noticed there were similar questions *after* I had written mine.
Thanks for the information. That's very helpful.
"We should grade 4 papers, but I have graded more than 6 peers, and the applications still keeps on giving me more assignments."
"I am so upset that I missed the deadline and could even not submit the answers.Could there be any rule like if submit one day late, the total score will decrease by 5% each day or something like this? And put a hard deadline. I really want to complete this course well. Can I get an extension for the week 3 homework? Thank you."
This doesn't appear to be working.
"I guess that sticking to a common time zone (such as the one at Stanford) would work, too."
"Dear professor Sonanni, I like your class and I learned a lot from this class. But I also noticed that you like to start your sentence with the word \So\"". I think you could really try to avoid that because this word really is not necessary."""
"there is no homework in unit 4, unless you're talking about the essay assignment."
great! looking forward
Thanks for confirming Prof. Kristin.
Hi everyone!
"Werner, there are 30'000 students taking this class at the same time. So the faculty won't have time to do it. So yes, it is necessary. Whether it works (whether everyone grades fairly) is another question..."
I too misunderstood the UTC deadline and could not complete the homework yesterday evening. I'll join the chorus in asking for an extension. Thank you for your consideration.
"As is \kinda\"" - our Professor is just using quite informal language in her presentations. Please don't change :)"""
"I think what is meant is that is neither a review of a single hot paper, or a book, or an interview with a fellow scientist as suggested."
My understanding is that you need to grade 4 essays to complete the assignment but you can do more for practice if you want. I wouldn't expect to get immediate feedback on the essay you submitted after that though - it has to be peer reviewed by three people first. If you want feedback sooner then speed things up by grading more essays!
yes :)
"Moderators, please extend the deadline for today. Please!"
"Several of the papers I graded were like this i.e. not a paper summary, book review or interview. One seemed to be a chunk of writing just copied straight from another paper or essay. It didn't make any sense so I marked everything as zero and ticked the box to say I was unsure of my grading. With the others I just looked at the writing and as long as it was clear and I thought I could understand the point the author was trying to convey then I went ahead and graded it."
"I keep trying to grade essays but the system kicks me out half way through editing. Very frustrating, this has happened to me six times. I will try another browser on another computer. Is this happening to anyone else? I'm using Safari..."
I saved my answers for Homework 3 and did not hit submit button. The time zone thing is confusing. Can you please consider if it is submitted today? I will be more careful about time zones in future!
"Please extend deadline of homework 3, Thanks"
is there any example anywhere in this course material??
"Some hot/classic papers are themselves reviews of multiple other recent \hot\"" or \""classic\"" papers related to a specific topic. For example, the paper I'm writing my essay on is a 2011 scientific journal article about Touch DNA in Forensics. The author didn't actually do any experimentation herself, but instead she has collected and summarized a bunch of other scientific papers to give an a general overview of the topic."""
"I also want to do the summary, but I have no answers to your question! sorry. If you find out, please let me know!"
"After I did the assigned number of grading, it tells me I did the needed number but that I can continue grading if I desire. I think it took five to get this message, so just do a couple more and see if it tells you this."
"Yes, it will make a message and tell you when you have graded enough essays. It is like 4 or 5. Anyways, the system will tell you that you have done the required number."
Happened to me as well.
Me too.
"If there's no chance to reopen the homework3, can we have other ways to make up?"
Seriously guys! You are in a Stanford Online Course. You are responsible for submitting your homework till the deadline ends. It is like: You don't show up [...]
"I just received an essay to grade that appeared to be plagiarised. When I ticked the box to report it, this pop-up message appeared:"
"Sorry, you seem to have missed to homework deadline! Please note that all deadlines in the course are displayed in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone!"
The issue has been resolved. Can you try again please?
"I tried opening the video, and it worked fine for me! If you're using Internet Explorer as your browser, please try switching to Google Chrome. The platform has known compatibility issues with IE!"
Your essay is due on October 29th!
"If you mean the video, it works fine for me! If you're using Internet Explorer as your browser, please try switching to Google Chrome. The platform has known compatibility issues with IE!"
You'll have to wait until your essay has been evaluated by the required number of your fellow students!
You can put examples in the box that allows you to give written feedback.
"The essay will go to new graders. So, yes, there is a chance that you could grades that are lower than before. However, we are hoping that you will get enough helpful feedback on the first draft that you can substantially improve the second draft and thus increase your grade. You will receive the grade that you get on the 2nd attempt."
"I came across the EXACTLY same thing! I got one grader who gave me two 0 points on concision and organization, and a total 5 out of 15!!! The point is he/she did NOT give me any comment on reason of this low grading."
You need to grade 4 papers. But you won't get your feedback until enough students have graded your essay.
I was lucky as most of my papers looked good and had references. Only this one was different - it was my fourth one.
"It's a nice program for me to jot progress of my work down too without worrying too much about the flow, as well as noting down some ideas or observation. It's much like a virtual notebook to document your thoughts as you brainstorm."
Hi - is it fine to review a popular science book or does it have to be something more technical/academic?
How can we edit our peer essay? 
Sounds fine - its how you write that will be graded rather than on what you write.
Is there anyway to undo a particular edit other than resetting all the edits in the peer edits?
Thank You! I have  submitted my essay -a profile of an ornitholgist!
"Hello there, this morning I was starting my first peer review but when I opened the page with the assay I received this message:"
Look at the top of the marking section - you can press the arrow key to view the other responses.
thank you!
I found the same type of discrepancy between assessments too but I took this as a kind of positive thing and saw it more as a signal that the low-marking person did not understand what I was saying rather than they marked me low spitefully. I've been looking at their feedback in greater detail to see where I might improve/simplify things though I have to say that I think their major problem with my essay seems to be that they simply didn't understand what I was trying to say. I think we need to remember that we don't all have the same background or language so some people will have great difficulties in understanding our work (I know I had problems assessing some due to language issues)  
Thank you very much for your encouragement.
"Today I discovered that the status of my first writing assignment in \Assessment Panel\"" has changed to \""Flagged\"". Does anyone by any chance knows what it means? Could it be that one of the reviewers decided that it is plagiarised?"""
It means someone has checked the box under the feedback window to say it contains inappropriate content or they suspect it is plagiarized. If they did so in error then I'm sure the staff will sort it out for you.
"Are you using the insert key on your keyboard? I'm just guessing, but perhaps working in overtype mode is the problem. You just need to type normally in the feedback box to add comments. Red means you've deleted something."
"I graded four essays and in one of them (and only one) my grading changed to 0 while I was editing the text. Fortunately, I looked over it again before hitting submit, but it might have happened to others..."
I lost one essay I wanted to grade so I refreshed the page several times until the essay in question popped back up. Maybe I was lucky but it might be worth a try?
"My essay was graded 12 out of 15. Two referees gave me 14 out of 15, while one gave me 10 out of 15. But while the first two corrected some little aspects of the writing (making me learn something), the third one left my paper as it was before -not a single correction-. If in him/her opinion my paper is less correct than for the other two referees (as is clear from the grading), shouldn't he post me back some corrections??"
"How can I resubmit my essay? Press the button \New Submission\"" first to get to a new window? I'm unsure and don't want to accidentally submit the same text again..."""
It may be that you didn't submit them all - if you get 'kicked out' or leave the screen before pressing submit then it isn't a valid review
Ignore me - am confused as we review four essays but our essays are review three times!
"What happens if the 2nd attempt assignment submission has lower scores than the first one? Is the system keeping the original scores, or you have to take the risk?"
Yeah I know :( I was just worried that the writer may get offended if I were to re-type what ever he/she already has written.
"@EElliott: yes, hopefully, they'll sort it out soon enough."
"Personally I don't think there is anything to fix (and certainly nobody would have time to review all the scores with 30,000+ submissions)- although it is disappointing and somewhat confusing we are simply discovering that people view things differently. I'm trying to see each of their points as positive feedback and a way of improving my communication with lay-people (ie. people outside my field) as I know those working within my field would have given fairly similar (and possibly good) scores as they know the original piece of work and understand the issues I discussed."
"How is the final grade computed? I got three grades, but the final grade is not their average."
Mine appeared to be the middle score
"Hello,"
Unfortunately I had pressed submit and received a validation message.
"Mine too... but as I read in some comments, it seem not to be always the middle one."
Thankyou EElliot
"Yes, I know it's quite difficult to review all the scores... but I was meaning just those that are given a 0 if they are complete, as ricolo said. It's quite unfair and really affect us."
"I have also graded more than 4 essays already and hit submit, but the system keeps on telling me that I have graded 1 essay and there are still 3 more."
"I have peer graded more than the necessary number of essays still,I am waiting to get mine back. I would like to know how long I have to wait for getting back mine with peer review."
"same to me MireiaF, and I am so worried now because I did all what I've been told to do, but still the system tells me to grade 3 more even though I've graded more than 6 essays already and hit submit."
Please could you just permit  me to send homework #3. Thank you
"Please, permit me to send homework #3. Thank you"
"When some researches wrote \The aim of this study were/was\"", Is correct write this sentence using to be verb is past, and why?"""
I'm quite sure that the reviewers did not want to give 0 points. There was something wrong with the grading process. After editting the essay the previously selected points changed to 0. I noticed it and put back the points but some people did not have to notice it.

"Regarding assignment 1: I saved before submission and that was fine. After submission, it is incomplete. I received the peer grading, did some editing and double checked the word count (478 including the title and references). Unfortunately again I had incomplete submission. Interestingly, it ends at the same position as before. Although the peer grading I received looks nice for an abruptly cut essay, this technical problem needs to be fixed."
And don't press backspace too many times
I got also confused about Homework 3. And did not receive a mail about it so missed the deadline like many others as I see here. Is it possible still to submit the answers so I can get the model answers at least? And is an extension of the deadline for Homework 3 an option? Thanks!
"I agree, it was difficult to know what exactly was important information and what was clutter. I kind of just guessed and, like you said, if it improved the original I gave myself a point. "
excellent! thank you very much for the effort.
"Hi all,"
Thanks I found it! But I can see only 3 edits.
"What a huge variation in scores! I think the only way to get a better idea is if more peers edited the essay. For example, if 5 peers graded the essay then the lowest score (which could have been a mistake)could be dropped."
Don't press backspace at all¡ª I've had to start editing about 5 essays!
I agree it should be a glitch in the system. This has happened to me just know: I checked the grades after I commented on an essay and all grades were randomly adjusted! 
Agreed. Sh*t happens sometimes and you find yourselves not in control. :(
"Absolutely agree. I got 10 out of 15 from one peer (quite a good result, really), but the \edit\"" section was completely empty. No comment, nothing. The impression was that the person simply didn't bother to read. Why 10 then? S/he could have easily given me 15 or 0 with such an attitude!"""
and this is what Dr. <redacted> replied to my earlier question which was similar to yours:
My first reviewer marked me 0 for clarity (Meaning Blank or incomplete) but gave me 3 for Focus. Does this make any sense at all? How can a essay possibly be blank or incomplete and have a proper focus?
Thanks for your reply. The same occurred with me: two graders gave me mostly 2s and 3s but one gave me 1s without much advice - I suspect they did not understand the topic.  
"Exactly my case, and they are more peers like that... see \unfair peer grading\"" topic :("""
"I've read the directions three times and see plenty of reference to \opportunity\"" to resubmit, but don't see if it's required."

Hi all
The same happened to me!
I agree with you. 
"Hello, Mewy."
I'd also like to know this as it seems to differ as mine is the middle value
"Paraplegics patients suffer from immobility due to spinal cord injury (SCI). They have difficulty in standing-up, due to their lower limb paralysis. To alleviate this, they are trained how to stand_up and compensate the missing action of their lower extremities during the rehabilitation process. The lifting and stabilizing forces are provided by the arm support which requires an abled patient¡¯s upper body. For support and balance, a walker frame, parallel bars, simple stationary standing frame or even chair arm rests are normally used. However, people practicing a fully arm support, standing_up,  faces later complications of the upper limb joints injuries. In addition to the arm support, standing-up in paraplegia can be facilitated by Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). It is a promising technology to restore motor functions for paralyzed patients. It adjusts electrical stimuli to induce muscle contraction and the corresponding joint movement. Achieving desired movements require suitable electrical stimulation to the muscles. It has both functional and therapeutic benefits. Restoration standing up would allow paraplegics to reach high objects inaccessible from wheelchair, make transactions at a counter and communicate with other people face to face. Succeed standing up could increase independence, privacy and moral by ruling out the need for an assistant. However, many obstacles are encountered in stimulating the paralyzed neuromuscular system. The control of multiple joints is difficult due to the complexity , nonlinearity , and time-variance of the system (human body) involved. Furthermore, physiological effects such as muscle fatigue, spasticity, and limited force in the stimulated muscle further complicate the control task. FES needs better control strategies to achieve the desired motion. Various studies have been done regarding the sit-to-stand movement during the early 90¡¯s. Many control methods have been tested and reported in the FES assisted standing up such as: on/off controller, switching curve controller, Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers, model-based control, fuzzy logic control, and neural network control. Solve FES control problems need adaptive intelligent systems. intelligent techniques for FES control are still in an early stage. Researchers tested Fuzzy logi in simulation studies only. so further researches and experimental validation on animal and human have the potentiality to provide intelligent controllers usab"
"To <redacted>, I agree with you scored 1 if the writing itself is boring or a poor essay. But I agree more with <redacted> on that if we really have difficult to grade due to background problem, it's much much better to reload another one than blindly grade a low score. I was thinking that am I too serious about the score, or a good discussion?"
"Praying for your 2nd submission! I wouldn't resubmit until the last hour of the due day. I don't wanna test how lucky I will be. Hopefully, someone would listen to us and agree on the importance of this."
"I can't more understand what you and other victims felt! To some extent, I would say that we are serious because we care about this class; we cared then we worked hard. Hope our efforts be listened rather than ignored."
Also I think the scoring should be placed **after** the edits.Scoring should be done after actual edits rather than before(ie after we read the essay) and that is how it is currently !
I too have the same question. My reviewer gave me excellent grade and did not ask me to add or delete anything from my essay. Is it compulsory to resubmit?
Do you mean submission of essay by writing assignment 1? (I already submitted it)
No you don't have to re-submit.
Do we have to submit any other essays other than this one?
"Hello,"
"I also find some inconsistency in my grading. One reviewer scored my essay with 13/15 and made some minor corrections. Another reviewer almost made the same comments but the score is 4/15. He/she graded 3 out of 5 items with a zero. First I thought that this reviewer must have had a bad day, but on the other hand the minor feedback seems sincere and I belief there must be a technical problem. I hope that the staff will fix that problem."
Is Writing assignment 1 Peer Grading considered Essay 02?
Then you need to grade 3 more
"That was in the original course description and can be found under \course info\"":"
"Please fellows, if you feel that you have made a mistake during your grading, you can simply re-start it from the beginning, and think twice before hitting the submit button. Scrutinize the essay and make sure that you have done everything according to the best of your knowledge, because we end up being victims of these mistakes and that's so heart breaking."
"Im really confused to ask about it, but is it normal, that 1 person that assessed my essay 1 gave me three 0 points? I think it's a liitle unfair because it looks like I sent blank. I dont want to resubmit it, I completely satisfied my final mark, just interested."
"Alyona, Feedback will be available when you have graded **four** essays. Keep grading!"
it is unfair but it might be a mistake. I just nearly submitted something after editing and noticed that the browser had changed my choices. I think this platform isn't very stable.
"Yes the same thing happened to me in every revision I did. Fortunately I noticed that since the beginning and I double-checked the options every time right before submitting, but it is very likely that many people did not realise that. "
"It's incompatible with Internet explorer and Safari, the discussion function does not work **at all** with these two browsers"

Demo edit 4-video is not clear; am just able to hear you... can you please help me out mam...
Thanks. This is proving harder than I thought.
thanks a lot!
"I joined the course a bit late... what are these essay 1,2 and 3?? am not getting it!"
Can anyone suggest the best online jobs for scientific editing?This can be a help for those interested in this career.
I am writing an article these days. Can I submit an abstract from my work so that I get a chance for review of a paper which I will submit for publication? Or does it have to be a paper written by another author?
"That's a good idea, I found that I changed scores as I was editing and was thinking about the essay in more detail so much better to score after editing"
"No, I mean those questions in the homeworks!"
"I really like the concept of brain storming on the go.  Just a little suggestion while driving or even walking, I would like to record my ideas on a voice recorder or my cell phone, and then come home and write them down.  There are those magical thoughts that just happen on the go, and I think voice recording helps to capture those thoughts before I forget them."
"Yes, I also found that confusing. A title really helps."
Then what do you mean by this comment?
This occurred to me when I tried to start Peer Grading before submitting my assignment. Submit your essay first then try the peer grading.
"I also have some miR experience and confirm it. It is generally used terminology. And it is great that it is so concise and has it own rules (\A uniform system for microRNA annotation\"" by Ambros et al, RNA 2003). Imagine another dozens of names like 'sonic hedgehog' that we have avoided :)"""
"So far as I can see, the actual paper you are reviewing is irrelevant. What matters is *your* writing. I can't imagine that many peer reviewers here are going to be hunting out the original article."
"In addition to what you guys already wrote, I also found that while peer grading, my feedback automatically submitted itself while I was in the middle of editing the essays. The first time it happened (and my essay editing was left halfway with no way to go back to the submission which I was grading), I assumed I might have pushed a button on my keyboard by mistake. However the next essay for grading soon popped up and the same thing happened while I was editing that essay too. And I am sure I did not press any button this time (I don't even think my keyboard has a shortcut button to submit while my cursor is in the middle of the essay). So now I have two incomplete gradings. Anyone else faced this issue?"
"i have graded 2 so fr. every time i grade one, a new one shows up. does it stop at some point or will they just keep popping in until i give up ? :-/"
"It's not about writing a better essay, but about getting the proper grades for that essay . Many people have complained about technical issues. One issue is that the browser or platform randomly shuffles the grade allotted before submitting feedback. Some people rechecked the grades they gave and submitted the correct grades; but others (like me) were not aware of this problem and did not do so. So some people out there would have gotten feedback and scores that do not reflect the actual scores given by their peers. The platform could have easily reshuffled the grades to give a 0."
"I was just editing an essay and found that the score for clarity had changed from a 3 to a 0! I did not click anywhere near that box after setting it to a 3, just went back to amend a comment in the feedback window. I only double-checked the grades as I'd read other comments here about them changing."
"I just found that the top score (clarity) changed from 3 to 0 although I did not click anywhere near it, just amended a comment in the feedback window, returned to the scores and the top one had changed."
I used Chrome and Android without problems.
"Dear Team,"
"Hello Kristin,"
"Hi, Sam,"
"Hello Rajhansa, than you for your response. I am using Safari."
"They will keep popping until you give up. But in order to see your grade, you need to grade a min of 4 essays (and 8 if you decide to resubmit)."
"I think you can, as long as you give credit and use \quotation marks\""."""
I am not having any problems with safari.
"After you have graded the required number of peer essays, and the required number of students have graded your essay, you should see a button for 'New Submission' on the Writing Assignment webpage. After you click on the button, you will be prompted to enter your new essay."
You'll be able to access your reviews as soon as your essay has been graded by enough of your peers!
"If you're using Internet Explorer as your browser, please try switching to Google Chrome. The platform has known compatibility issues with IE!"
Yes! The writing assignment was the only homework for Unit 4!
"Resubmission is not mandatory! If you're happy with the grades and feedback you have received, you can pass over on the option to resubmit."
"The self-assessment questions in the homeworks do impact your grades. Unfortunately, you seem to have missed the deadlines for the first three homeworks! The Open EdX platform makes it very difficult for us to extend deadlines for individual students! You only need a total score of 60% at the end of the course to get the Certificate of Achievement, though, so you can definitely recover from this!"
"For a section that has a quiz associated with it, you can access the quiz by scrolling to the bottom of the webpage that has the section's video, and clicking on the button with the forward arrow on it."
"Apologies! The process does require all the peer graders to be conscientious, and it's unfortunate if some students don't take the grading process seriously!"
You need to grade 4 papers in all before being able to access your own essay scores!
"If you're using Internet Explorer as your browser, please try switching to Google Chrome. The platform has known compatibility issues with IE!"
"As Elfatih pointed out, the error message should disappear once you have submitted your own essay!"
"I love to do this when I wake up in the morning.  I always have to set the alarm for at least 30 to 60 minutes before I get out of bed. Love to just lay there, look out the window at the forest and create new learning activities for my class or think about how I am going to write something.  The hard part is then writing it down."
I am using Google Chrome strictly.
"I lost one essay with my scores and comments, and had another one getting reset with 0 scores in 3 sections. There should be a feature to save the work we are reviewing before hitting submit."
"I just read a fascinating article in the Oct 19th issue of The Economist entitled \Unreliable Research: Trouble at the Lab.\"" I highly recommend this to anyone interested in academic writing and the reliability of published data. I found the part about sloppy peer review and the emphasis on quantity (instead of quality) of writing especially relevant to this course."""
"Thank you. I did it all before and graded more tham 4 papers. I think, it was a ploblem with the system."
Thanks a lot.
I was using Firefox.
"I don't think the system is fair - some reviewers rush through the process, just gave grades and made almost no comments - I got twice 0/3 because I think by mistake (or: hurry) they just skipped the section, not because they graded it low. I¡¯m disappointed considering how much time I invested for a quality response."
A question regarding peer-review of Assignment 1.
I was using Firefox as well.
"The note \error\"" shows. I can only use my laptop to download and watch the classes. In statistical corse i did, i had no such issues. Any advice?"""
Hi!
Same problem!
"I always use long words and phrases in my writing, sometimes just because I already used the same words many times and I try to replace it with some longer phrases."
please i need explanation for the flagged in assessment panel for essay
"It is, (or at least should be) understood by researchers in all fields. That is why I want to send it as an assignment. To get comments and make it more understandable."
"I am finding this issue a little problematic. I am a native speaker, and had a few essays that were obviously written by non-native speakers. One was bad enough that I had a hard time understanding the focus of the study, what work was actually done, and by whom. I tried to grade as fairly as I could and make edits based on what I could make sense. The only two reviews my work received that included edits were \corrected\"" into a grammatically incorrect mess."""
"While there are many useful tips here, it would be even better to collect more. As Kristin said, everyone has his/her personal approach, but many of the people taking the course actually do not have an approach or experience in writing yet."
"Sensible, but that's going to make life hard, as I don't have university access to anything.  Open access papers aren't restricted to citing open-access papers - and many open-access journals are, shall I put this politely, of questionable quality."
Okay. I got the point
I cannot peer any essay. This is the message I get everytime I try to do it:
The same happens to me... probably this is related with the system itself. I hope they can solve it on time or modify the deadlines!!
Thank you very much for sharing!
"I have the same problem, may I ask for help/ technical support??"
"I cannot review any peers' essays. Is it due to the fact that I have not submitted my own essay? Is there any \tasks' order\"" that need to be followed?"
When I'm in the Writing Assignment 1 Peer Grading section the only thing I can see is:
"Apparently my essay has been flagged, no explanation given; could I at least know why?"
I have the same problem. I will be grateful for help.
"It seems that it happens when one of the reviewers decides to flag your essay for plagiarism or abusive content. I and a few other people have the problem of being flagged. I have been having it for almost a week or maybe even a little bit more. No changes yet, still flagged."
Hi!
Yes 
"The checkbox gives three possible reasons for flagging: explicit, offensive or (suspected) plagiarism."
Safari 4 and up can handle HTML5 well. Check your version and apply updates to the latest version.
"I have already graded 2 students responses, but in the writing assessment part 1 it is written I have assessed 0 students responses. Anyone having the same problem?"
I often use a voice recorder for writing on the go!
It's fine to quote someone with quotation marks.
"The textbox is not set up to accept graphics, so you will have to rely on text descriptions."
The original articles do not have to be open access.
Everyone has to do 4 reviews but will only get 3 reviews. This helps ensure that everyone will get enough reviews (in case some people fail to do their reviews). The resubmits end up back in the queue and will be graded by others who are submitting (or resubmitting) their essays around the same time.
"Great, cause I had none of these."
Also got that. Are you going to resubmit and see if you get better reviews next time? I think I will do that: take into consideration the interesting comments I got and resubmit.
"I received a couple of 1's, mostly 2's and a couple of 3's. YET, My reviewers did not change one single word in my essay, nor make any suggestions. I need the comments and suggestions!!"
This message appears when you try to start peer grading before you submit your essay. Make sure your essay is submitted (check the Assessment Panel section above). The error message should disappear after you submit your assignment.
thx.
"I have the same problem, I added whole essay, but only part of it was submitted. What could go wrong? I am sure I will get 0, but for resubmit I want to be sure this problem will be solved. "
"Same here, I received two points for each section and no comments or changes in the essay at all; it was my lowest score and thus lowered my over all score. It's not fair to grade without even reading the text and giving random scores just to get over with."
My assignment is flagged. so what happens next? I have been working hard to get distinction and now am disappointed to see my assignment flagged for 'God knows What'
"Hello Glen, Senta"
"Another issue is that chekbox regarding plagiarism or inappropriate content. Its position just above \submit' will cause un-intentional checks and flags."""
Same problem occurred with me twice.
"I submitted my essay twice. First submission is incomplete; it end at this particular point (P . The rest of the essay contains: P value was .... till conclusion. This happened also with my second submission, it ends at the exact same point despite much editing before that particular sentence. "
"With a lot of problems and complaints related to assignment 1, I think the course staff will need sometime to address all these issues. I hope they will evaluate these flagged assignments carefully."
Got the same question in my mind. And now I believe it should be October 29th. I think someone should correct the google calendar dates.
"Dear Administrators,"
"The comments and edits of the reviewers were spot on. The revised essay, reviewed by a new set of peers, got better scores, plus some more great feedback as well. "
"Agree, after my unhappy experience with peers on second submission"
"Like many others, I'm waiting for resolution of the \flagged\"" status of my essay and would appreciate at least a general response as to what's happening.  I reviewed an article from the literature, and consciously tried to re-phrase and summarize in my own words.  Since being flagged, I have run the text through several on-line plagiarism checkers and consistently find that these don't indicate any copying."""
"I think it is now Tuesday 29th October. There were some problems with the system meaning people couldn't get on it, so the deadline was extended."
"I had a number of very confusing reviews for the first essay. One reviewer made the comment, \Excellent paper  - could not find any suggestions for improvement. Well done!!\"" (thanks by the way!) but had given me 0's and 1's only in the scoring. Could there be a problem with the review system? "
The viewer might edited your essay first then planned to give you the marks--but he or she forgot!
"I am after second review. Although I had applied to comments and corrections, nothing has changed (maybe I should say thankfully - I could be graded even worse). If you resubmit, you will be graded by different people - not the same you used to be."
"I have the same problem as Tia.  As well, one reviewer changes the meaning of my text.  I almost wanted to say to him/her, \No!\"""
"I finished my essay many days ago and I received the \famous\"" flagged state."
"I opened yesterday a peer grading to work on it. I completed it, but, unfortunately, when I have refreshed the page, another peer essay has appeared. I tried refreshing the page to get that essay; but no way, it has disappeared !"
Everyone should think twice before marking an essay as suspicious. I am very disappointed with this peer review system.
* I cannot agree more with you All.
In the second assessment round ones again the peer feedback feels like a lotery.
The blank line is purely to make life easier for your peer reviewers; the system does not recognize if you leave this out. So you are probably unable to resubmit simply because your essay has not been graded by three peer reviewers yet (or you have not finished your peer reviews).
We are working to review these flagged essays as quickly as possible!
"The essays are worth 50%, quizzes 10%, and final exam 20%, so you can still make it over the 60% mark."
We extended the deadline to the 29th due to the technical issues with the peer review system when it first opened.
"Congratulations, your done with the assignment! If you are happy with your grade, you don't need to do anything else."
Remember: You have 7 total essays to grade. You will grade 3 during the learning to grade calibration process and 4 official peer-reviews. The message you see telling you how many you have left to grade begins after the learning to grade process. 
"If your essay has been \flagged\"" by a peer reviewer, don't despair--we are working to resolve these as quickly as possible. We have to manually review each of these, so it does take some time. If we do find plagiarized or inappropriate material, the essay will receive a score of zero. However, if your essay is free of inappropriate content and plagiarized material, it will be released to the grading queue soon."""
"Ricolo..I also believe that no one here is being spiteful. I had graded 4 essays and gave everyone a 3 and some 2. I also edited their essays and sent them feedback. Well, how surprised do you think I was when I realised a software bug may have made all the scores I gave into '0'. So you see- 'I' might have also graded your essay and given you a '0' when I meant to give you '3'. It is unlucky for you true..but hopefully you will do better with your re-submission as everyone who has viewed the discussion is now aware of the problem and we will re-check our scores before submitting."
What non-sense! I would have to have amazing skills to hit my screen 'randomly' and manage to re-shuffle all of them to exactly '0'. It is a technical issue- no doubts about it.
"I have already done 4 peer reviews, but it counts as I have graded only one students response. What to do????"
You have to first submit your essay before you can begin the peer-grading process!
"Students with flagged essays require an instructor or TA review. We are reviewing flagged essays as quickly as possible.

"Last tuesday it wouldn't let me submit my answers to the homework although i was a few hours before the deadline, is there anything that may be done?"
"At least you seem to be getting feedback. I'd be happy about ANY feedback. 2 out of my 3 reviewers apparently randomly clicked some grading buttons, but left 0 comments. How am I supposed to improve my writing if I don't receive any feedback? "
I got a mixture of peer review:
"Hi there,"
"Where did you get the \flagged\"" message? I don't understand how the \""Assessment Panel\"" section/page here works. Is this where you get the \""flagged\"" message? There is a \""flagged\"" status message in my \""Assessment Panel\"" page/section here. After I pressed the submit button last night, a message returned that I have successfully submitted it.   Today, I tried to do peer review, and I was able to. I'm so confused. I'm absolutely certain that my essay wasn't plagiarized. I worked many hours on it, and slept very late, in fact. The source of the article is written at the bottom, so anyone can access it online."""
"I think I have a similar problem with the \flagged\"" message. Sorry, I am all over the forum about this. Totally in panic! I worked hard and long on that. I am hoping that the \""flagged\"" message is related to my unfinished peer reviews ( I have finished one already.)  Otherwise, I would be grateful for some explanations."""
"I think dropping the lowest score is a little bit better than counting the average score from 3 peer review, if one of them gave us 0 point. But how about if we get two zeros point from two peer reviews due to the \software technical problem\""?"""
"Our hope is that by having several peer reviews, at least one or two will be helpful. So glad you had an excellent one!"
"Unfortunately, these kinds of things happen. Hopefully, if it is an excellent essay, your peer will get good grades from the other two reviewers. Only the middle score counts, so your erroneous score will be dropped."
"We hope that everyone will get at least one helpful review. It's too bad that all three were not helpful in your case, but use the one that was helpful!"
"My problem is different. I'm trying to be careful and conscientious with my peer reviews but can't seem to actually go back to the same student's paper. I got my first one (a biomedical summary - yikes - not my forte), made a word doc so I could take my time and proceeded to edit as best I could. Then, when I went back to post my edits a different paper showed up. The next on was more up my alley so I made a word doc again. This one I spent a bit of time on but when I went to post again, it was gone and another one was there. I have since seen at least 5 different papers. Is this a way we can \choose\"" a paper to grade or am I just missing something? I have spent some time on the peer grading but have yet to complete one and am a bit frustrated."""
"While looking at the edits provided by Peer 1 and trying to incorporate them in \New submission\"", I noticed that there are few edits which are not reflected in track change mode. "
"Thanks for your comments, Susanne"
"Also thank you Carolyn. And I hope you can submit all other questions on time! I would like to add, is just me or the effort estimation of 4-8 hours/week is far away from the hours actually needed?"
Thank you
"Hi all,"
"Thanks for the reply, Meagan. "
verbs quick than nouns?make my paper interesting and be cared by readers
"Also, if the reviewer has already identified instances of plagirarism, maybe they should comment next to those sentences to assist in the manual review. "
"I, too, am getting this message, and I already have submitted my essay. I even get a confirmation message that my essay was submitted. I hope this issue can be resolved soon so that I can start with the peer reviews."
Thank You very much :)
How long did you have to wait (in average) to get a grade on your essay?
I had submitted the right answer in the second chance which is option b.Yet it reverted back to my first submitted answer and I landed up with incorrect answer thereby losing points. Please help.

Why the words in the demo edition are fuggy?
"Thanks for your information - I already peer reviewed four assays, but I am still waiting for mine to be graded."
"I submitted very early and graded immediately four essays, but I don't have a grade yet too :("
"Yes, I edit first, then fill in my scores -- as I have a much better idea of how to score after I've taken a closer look at the writing.  In all cases, scores were randomly marked even though I had not chosen any.  I updated them just before submission.  But during one edit, my computer was turned off; I was hoping I could finish when it came back up, but no luck. Hopefully, it was marked as unfinished and incorrect scores weren't tallied."
Thank you very much Professor <redacted> for your kind answer. 
Thanks :)
"Ref subject above, a save button may help reviewer to first save his work and go through rest of the required essays so that he may be able to come back and rethink about his grading prior to final submit. In Coursera courses, we are provided with list with hyper links of each student whom we had graded so that we may again and again see our grading and finally submit after we are fully satisfied by our work. This also enhance the chance that we do not do injustice to any student unintentionally."
"Thank you, Nehajain"
"In one of the other discussion topic, I think I read that the middle score (2nd score out of the 3 scores) is what is taken as the FINAL score. Check it out."
"You may want to check if your essay got flagged by somebody. If yes, then that may take some time due to manual verification done by Prof. and team."
But this is a science writing course so you cannot expect other students to be familiar with the conventions of your specific field.
"I copied an article from the peer review site and edited in MS words, but I couldn't paste back to the comment section. The only thing I can do from the peer review section is to mark the grade."
I have a yellow bang after the Assessment Panel link in my nav bar. Do I need to do anything? There's no relevant information on the Assessment Panel page.
I red an article and found perfect examples of irrelevant abbreviations and the unnecessary clutter:
You won't be able to cut and paste from MS Word with track changes. But you can easily recreate the changes you made in MS Word in the textbox.
We'll look into it. Thanks for letting us know.
"I've done 4 peer assessment, but when I enter that page I will still get another passage, so I'm wondering whether I have a problem same with others: assessments were not counted. So I want to check the number, could any one tell me where it is...thanks!"
"There are two places to find this.  First, click on the Progress link and you should see a score for your essay (remember, that score is the middle score of the three reviews).  If you go back to your essay you should be able to see the peer reviews as well."
"Someone has the same problem than me? I have peered 5 submissions (and I know that we only need 4) and all the time I have the message \You need to peer grade 2 more submissions in order to see your feedback\"". "
where can you se that info? I mean th number os students that you've graded and how many have graded you.
"Yes, it has to be a new submission, MajaK. "
I have graded almost 10 essays and I still keep getting the same message:

I have the same problem than you and I don_t Know what to do!
"Yes, it was in the Assesment Panel. I did 4 reviews as it was required but I'm waiting for my reviews. Good luck Raleen!"
me too
"hi, me too. how did you resolve?"
Thanks a lot. I will get to work right away.
"I am always extremely anxious about writing papers.  I try to make it easier by setting small goals to accomplish, but I never end up accomplishing them.  This makes me feel like I can't set goals for myself because I'm going to disappoint myself when I can't complete the goal (for example: write 2 sentences in the introduction).  Perhaps my perfectionism is getting in the way, but I often find setting goals is so discouraging.  I am not sure how to get around this because I want the goals to make me feel less anxious, but no matter how small I set the goals, I am too anxious to accomplish even the smallest of goals. Any tips or suggestions?"
"Wow, bold identification referring to Guilds.  I must agree with the statement and the comment's tone. I have worked (and written) in the sciences for more than 30 years. The deification of passive voice is endemic to the field. And yet, if the scientific writers could embrace it, active voice is so much more appealing, interesting, and actually readable.  May be a lost cause though -- similar to getting power point presenters not to READ their slides to the audience."
Question: I am happy with my first submission and peer assessments. Do I still have to resubmit for final grading?
"Almost everyone has anxieties about writing, and you see right here on this forum and in peer review that there are English-as-a-second-language students who face a dual challenge (writing and writing in a non-native language) and manage to complete their work."
"Oh, that it were that simple.  I'm on treatment and still just as bad as Annessa."
> I'm on treatment and still just as bad as Annessa.
thanks a lot :)
"Thanks. What a relief! I had this since I submitted my essay. inside, it said my essay is \flagged\"" though. I hope it would go away now, after peer reviewing 5 essays."""
"Hi,"
"Yeah. I know what you mean. There really should be a mechanism that forces the reviewer do make comments on the actual paper, rather than clicking random numbers and submitting."
"I totally agree with what you are telling.But then the definition of moisture is what I put up. Not a single person \flagged\"" my essay till now for plagiarism. "
"I keep getting this error message when I go to the Peer Grading section. I have already submitted my own essay (received confirmation of submission at bottom of essay page). I hope someone can help me get this resolved, since right now it won't let me do any peer grading! I'm using Safari on a Mac."
"I've run into a couple of peer reviews that have no feedback whatsoever and went straight down the line as \2\""s for score.  Normally I would assume that that means my writing is so average it's okay, but every other peer review has had constructive feedback, and varied in scores in consistent areas."
"I agree too! One of my reviewer gave me 3 for concision by 0 for focus. Doesn't make sense. My best guess, either we are simply victims of the technical bug where the score jumps when the page is scrolled or people don't mark sensibly."
"I use the reference manager tools like Mendeley or Readcube to take out the important points in an article. I am used to read in the computer and skim through the paper fast, it may not be good for everyone. Having said that those two tools will help better organize the endless pdf's on your system. Also to avoid the literature explosion in pubmed, one can try gopubmed for effective literature mining."
I have the same problem also on mac but using Chrome
Thank you for the clarification Dr <redacted>
Useful. I enjoyed the quiz.
this week and the first 2 I spent less than 4 hours. the week I wrote my essay I probably spent more closer to 8.
"Hello, for emergency reasons I must withdraw from the course, what are the steps to follow? Thanks"

"I see all these posts of the forum of people discussing their grades... am I the only one still stuck with a \Your response has been submitted. Please check back later for your grade.\"" on my submission page?"
Facts: 
"In one of my reviews, the peer commented that my essay was really good, and yet most of the scores were 0. I am sure this was a technical issue with the site."
"Help! I have just discovered that I had some problem with my essay submission! In copying/pasting process, a phrase was lost and now a part of the text seems senseless! How can I do? Have I to wait for my revisions and re-submit the correct form?...I'm so sorry!"
This is how we will be scored:
Hi 
"From my peer graders I got some very unfair grades. E.g. grader 1 gave 3 points for concision and organization while grader 2 gives 0!! points. 0 points for \blank or incomplete essay\"" is purely a joke here."
same here...
"I too am disillusioned with the peer review process. The only peer reviewer to provide feedback as well as ticking 'boxes' commented that I write with clarity, using short paragraphs whose [SIC] purpose is clear, that I use simple language and for this reason they scored me highly - clarity 1 (difficult to understand throughout), concision 1 (full of clutter), organization 1 (disorganized, chaotic, confusing) and focus 1 (main point is impossible to discern). "
You need to submit your essay first.
same here .... where can I get/see my peer reviews?
I see. Thnx for info :))
I tried using Firefox and it didn't work there either. I'm hoping we get a solution soon...
"I forgot to add the reference to the original paper I summarized... Is there a way to fix this, or will I have to resubmit after I receive the peer grading?"
"Couldn't we all redo our peer-assessment duties, checking carefully for the magically changing grades? I know it is a lot of time but really now our marks are just random. Taking the middle score will just make everyone's assay at 2-2-2-2-2 most probably. I do not mind reviewing assays again if it makes the whole thing a bit more fair."
"Hello,"
Hi 
"Hi.  Two of my reviewers made ridiculous edits that made the text awkward and changed the meaning!  Do not peer review if you don't understand what we are learning in this course!  Even though the grading of my essay ended up okay, I'm not happy with it."
"I posted separately that two of my peer reviewers graded unfairly and I don't think they have been watching the videos because their edits were unclear (and outright wrong!), inappropriate, and changed the meaning of my text."
Some people here cannot read with a good understanding of the topic...
I am having the same problem...................................
"Yes, I agree!  One reviewer gave me 3s.  Two reviewers gave 1s and 2s and rewrote my essay to be unintelligible!"
"Hi, Kathy, I so agree with you! Same story here: two of my reviewers were quite obviously no native speakers and not very good at English either. They made an absolute mess of my carefully composed essay. I submitted the text twice. The first submission came back with good, constructive criticism, so I revised my text into something I was really content with, but when I got back the second submission I could not believe people had had the guts to \improve\"" my language if they obviously were in no position to do so. One of them had not understood the first thing about my text and had even managed to change the main theme. The third reviewer gave me full score and edited absolutely nothing. How can this be?"
"Hi,"
Me too

Thanks! :)
"From the three reviewers two has flagged me with 1's in all sections, and the third with 2's and 3's. The third reviewer have given me some hints, however the other two have missed to comment the essay; well to be honest one have said: \I do not know anything about biology, thus I can't give my opinion\"". I suggest that If a reviewer scores a lower mark would be mandatory to point and suggest anything. "
"I got 8/15, 8/15 and 13/15 and my total score is 8/15. For me the highest is dropped. Is it normal ?"
"I start a revision and if the page of navigator change I lost all my revision job, other student review appears, and I start again!!!"
"The assessment Panel in the courseware shows the status as finished and grader type as peer assessment, but I am not able to see any grades posted.I would really appreciate if you could clear this confusion."
"To read this as I do, to keep the ideas separate,  for each pair of opposites, read the first in a low voice and the one in brackets in a high squeaky one.  You will soon think you have hiccups."
FYI some old typewriters and maybe present PCs don't have dash keys and double hyphens substitute for hyphens.  Doubles hyphens are usually automatically converted to dashes nowadays.
"Thank you so much. I will post a review of this book in Amazon,UK."
"Just my opinion... but after reading tons of posts, I believe too many are taking this course way too seriously.  This is a  non-credit course.  There is no verification process to establish the one receiving a certificate is the one who completed the assignments.  Most complain about how their grades were unjustified--the goal is to learn to write better, not to get a 3 rather than a 2.  If a reviewer is unfamiliar with content, wouldn't it be honest to admit that?  There is no mechanism for a reviewer to omit a grade if content is beyond them.  Also, it is obviously commendable that everyone is working hard, but effort does not necessarily equate to high marks.  In the old days there were grades for effort distinct from grades for content knowledge.  There is no such thing here.  If a reviewer can't suggest any  improvements for any reason, it'd be better not to make some up."
"In a course with <zipRedac>0000+ students, you can expect incorrect editing. For a majority, this may be  their first experience with writing and editing. Mentioned in week 6 of this course:[ editors may ask you to do some changes. You better send them back a cover letter indicating the changes you made. If you disagree with the editor , you can clarify your point of view. So, even professional editors may ask for changes that you don't like.]It's frustrating when you receive non-helpful editing but don't underestimate the benefit you gain from reviewing your peers. I read an excellent essay while reviewing and that one has inspired me to go back and rewrite my own essay."
"Ignoring \0\"" from computer glitches, I notice in many of the posts protesting \""0\"" grades, there is no mention of the second part of that rubric:   \""If you receive an essay that is blank or INCOMPLETE (contains only a few sentences OR garbled writing), you may assign a score of ¡°0¡± for all areas.\""  Thus, in my view, a \""0\"" can be assigned to an essay that is not blank and that contains more than even a few sentences. A \""0\"" can be assigned for \""garbled writing.\""  Of course, what is considered \""garbled\"" may be vague and subjective.  BTW I have not submitted my essay and have not graded any yet."""
"I have the same problem, but I have submitted by essay. When can I do the peer reviewing?"
"It's not about getting high grades or not.  It's about other students who are making edits that are unintelligible and therefore, do not have the knowledge, even after reviewing the videos, to grade other students' homework assignments."
How to I access my essay Peer Assessments (I mean my original essay that my classmates have assessed?)  Thanks
Can someone provide some support for me to access the Peer Assessments on my essay?  Thanks.
"I graded 5 essays, and when I got back my own essay grade, I found out that only 3 peers reviewed my essay. In fact, one of them did not put anything on the rubric, nor write any comments. Then I checked my Progress Chart and saw that I got 13/15 (87%). The bar is also grayed. What does this mean? Should I resubmit my essay with the suggested revisions? The suggestions for revisions were minor, but I just want to know how having only 3 peer graders could affect my overall course grade."
"My two cents worth about those reviewers who aren't familiar with the field of study they're reviewing essays for: It was clear in the Writing Assignment 1 instruction that we should write for ALL the different students here who come from different areas. And that means that we should write for the average reader, lay public. I'm not from the hard sciences, so I had a hard time understanding 3 of the essays I reviewed. One was really so technical. I tried my best to grade fairly, but made comments and suggestions to rewrite the essay for the average reader. Another one was from molecular biology, but her/his essay was fun to read and I was able to understand everything. It was really good; I gave it 15 points. I did not have to change anything there, or make suggestions. I wish now I copied it (for myself) so I can make it a model of clear writing in the sciences. So, it is really difficult to express complicated information using simple language, but it can be done."
"My keyboard has no dash key and it is not possible (so far as I can tell) to generate a dash automatically in the essay submission window. Pasting in a dash from other software works, but probably best to give people the benefit of the doubt here as not everyone taking this MOOC will have access to WP software. I'd assume a double hyphen was intended as a dash."
Exactly!
"Hear, hear!"
"Once you refresh or navigate away from the grading page, the essay will rejoin the queue and you will lose any edits you have made. There is no way to choose a paper other than keep refreshing the page to load a new one. You need to keep the page open and do not refresh before submitting your grades and edits. Not sure cutting and pasting from Word would work. Completing the edits in the browser might be the safest option."
"Thank you Sudarshan for taking the time to say something positive :) Its a shame the discussion board is full of complaints at the moment. The reviews I got were not very helpful but I think it's amazing that we can practice peer reviewing like this, and I'm sure that most people will gain some useful insight from the process, even if they're not happy with their grade or the comments they receive."
Same here and I made the required number of peer reviews.
"With around 5-10,000 essays floating around, the one thing we can be pretty sure of is that the course team won't be marking any! I'd guess that the essay is put back into the pool for a further review."
I also have the same problem...
"I have the same issue with my essay. I got only 3 reviews ( it needs 4 at least), and one of these reviews has nothing in it (no score. no comment). I have been reading and commenting in the discussion forum and realized we aren't alone in this problem. From what I have read, \blank\"" review may just be an error due to when reviewers accidentally push a key or a button that reloads or refreshes the page. I am not sure, though. I haven't read any satisfying/convincing response to this question."""
"If you're using Internet Explorer as your browser, please try switching to Google Chrome. The platform has known compatibility issues with IE!"
"You can switch to a high-definition video by clicking on the button marked \HD\"" below the video on the course webpage.But the most effective solution in this case may be for you watch the video on YouTube! There are multiple resolution options within the YouTube player, as well as the option to view in a larger window or full screen."
"I am not from the sciences ( I'm from the social science and education), but I love reading about quantum physics, chaos theory, and other \esoteric\"" fields because I find them really fascinating. Of course, I can only grasp those articles that are written conceptually, but I enjoy them immensely when the writing is clear and understandable. Imagine if more people can read more into fields that aren't their expertise. People would be more communicating, and in a more appropriate and clearer manner."""
"Thanks for pointing this out! We are working on this issue, and it should be fixed soon!"
You need to submit your essay before you can begin the peer grading process!

"I graded even more than 4 papers, but there is still such message below my essay:"
"Raj, what do the instructions mean by the *middle* score? Surely you mean the *median*? And why not the mean? If your middle score (Assessor #2) is less than the upper and lower, that's just chance. But the median (and even better, the mean) would be a fairer score. This is more robust."
"Not sure whether I posted this in the correct category, apologies if not, but then again, that's another issue with this platform."
"Thank you, Elfatih. You do have a point. Reviewing other students' papers has been very helpful for me too. And yes, I did receive some excellent feedback the first time around. Most essays I read were quite interesting too and one was absolutely brilliant, about touch DNA. That one came up just when my daughter was watching CSI, which was great! I think it was just my disappointment of not having improved my grade that ticked me off. But yes, this course is about learning, not about hunting for high marks. Thanks for enlightening me."
I used Chrome for android from my tab. This is the second time this happened :(
Hi Dr Sainana
Thanks a lot.
That's the problem...no little arrows anywhere.
The bar for essay 1 is still at 0.
I found an exclamation mark in the Assessment panel.
"Yep, me and my friend have got the same problem! Thank's for posting it! We're waiting for the solution! Have a nice day!"
"I have writing anxiety too - and I also see myself as a perfectionist. I take a long time to get even very small goals done and I end up feeling really guilty if I don't accomplish my goal. But I think setting small goals helps us stay focused and we just have to try our best, pushing aside any anxiety."
Hi. 
"actually some people do not understand technicalities of other's subjects or topic of essay therefore, some times they mentioned \i could not understand sentence\"" etc."""
"Same here! I tried accessing the peer review section yesterday before I submitted my own essay and I got that error, but I tried again just now after submitting my essay, and I still get that error! "
"Anyone who's faced with this problem, please help"
Hi Kristin!
Google chrome as well. That message disappeared after I submitted my essay.
I am facing this same problem kindly help.
Hi there!
"And now it's visible. I guess it was just a matter of time, still I don't understand why such a delay (several hours), if the peer review was already finished."
Is it through the assessment panel?
"Hi good morning, I just signed up for the course, but I have seen it started almost a month ago, I do not know if I can join the course or it would be more appropriate to wait for the next."

I'm facing the same problem and I've already submitted my essay.
I have continued gradding but I still have the same problem...
"Yes you should do, unless you will not see your result."
"Same problem, where is tech support?"
Same problem.  I submitted my essay a few days ago and yet I don't have access to the learning to grade module or the peer essays. The error message never disappeared.
"I know this, but I already did 4 essays, and I saw my grade. Now I did my second submission with corrections. This is my question: ***Should I review new essays to obtain my new grade***?"
yes
"I have reviewed four essays as required, but still I cannot see my grade from other peers. The system indicates that I have only reviewed one essay. Any help?"
"Kristin, I've submitted my essay (first try) to the Stanford system for peer review and simultaneously posted it to my two blogs on [<redacted: [Student Blog]>][1] and [<redacted: [Student Blog]>][2]."
"I have the same problem and I got a message that I have graded  0 essay, though I have graded 8 essays!"
"I re-submitted my essay, but have received exactly the same peer review grades and comments. "
"The same thing with me. Finish grading 4 essay, and the exclamation mark  will go away."
"Hi,"
I am facing same problem.Its been 9 hours now.I have submitted my essay but still error remain same.I am working on google chrome. Please help!
"Hi, "
"Hi,"
The exclamation mark then again reappears when your peers have submitted some grades to notify you.
Interesting discussion! :-)
I have submitted my essay and assessed 4 from my peers. I think my grade after their assessment is OK and my question is if this grade can change if we decide to re-submit our essay.
"check \course info\"" - you will find most of the information there!"""
I also have the same problem.
"Hi,"
I submitted my essay but I cant see my peer essay to review!
"I am reviewing the second peer review now, both of them did not have any references and do not seem to comply with the task. They seem to describe their own research."
"Hello,"
"Hi, once again thanks to the staff for yet another great course."
Calendar says homework 4- essay 1 is due by oct 22 and homework 5-peer grading is due by oct 29.
"me too, Juliana"
"If you received three peer grades, this means that your essay was unflagged and cleared of plagiarism. "
"We have temporary access to TurnItIn software, which a lot of universities are using. It is quite good--as it shows you exactly where material has been copied from on the internet. So, yes, there's great software out there!"
"Aaaah, right! Thanks a lot! :)"
This will be available by the start of week 6 (it's the week 6 assignment).
I resubmitted mine and have to review four more assays in order to get the new grade back.
Essay 1 is due on Oct. 29 and peer reviews are due on Nov. 1.
"Hi Jennie,"
"I can't seem to find the \Learning how to Peer Review\"" exercise we must complete before doing our peer reviews. I read through the example, but don't see a way to move past that. Can someone please help?"""

I graded more than 4 essays and I still have the yellow exclamation...
I have the same problem...
I still have the same problem...
Thanks a lot.
"Hello David, I have a similar problem too. I have reviewed 5 essays but the system only shows that I have done  only one. What could be the problem?"
Someone please advice me. I have reviewed 5 essays but I cannot still see my grades.
I have not received my essay review either and would like to have time to make improvements if necessary. How long should we wait? Where should we look for it?
"If anybody has doubts as to where it will turn up, it appears in the Writing Assignement 1 section."
"Dear Kristin, "
"I am trying to submit for the second time, but new submission button does not respond."
I had the same question. I hope we can keep the higher grade of the two submission. I really want to have more feedback but I don't want to get lower grade.
There are no arrows anywhere. Guess only one peer evaluated my work.
"I've noticed in the discussion topics that people are finding their assignments are coming back graded with 0's.  After I had scored a writing assignment tonight and was editing it, I noticed that the system changed the scores I gave back to 0's while I was editing. I had to rescore the assignment, and I'm glad I caught it. This could explain the rash of questions people are having about their scores."
"I had the same problem. I chose to edit the text first, but after I finished editing, all the scores are 0s or 1s, while I didn't even touch the scores."
Essay 2 is writing assignment 2 and it has not yet begun..I've read in another post that Dr <redacted> would be posting it in the first week of November.So don't worry :)
"JMP1--have you had any success yet? I haven't, and I even went and tried on a PC instead of a Mac. I still keep getting the error message (already submitted essay). I am not sure what we should do at this point since our repeated postings don't seem to get answered by a class admin person. Perhaps just keep posting about this issue?"
"JMP1--I cannot fix it, I am a student in the class. I do hope the admin team or OpenEdX staff can fix it soon. Not sure what else to at this point except to continue to post about it. I should write an essay on this issue for Assignment 2 :-)."
I have the same problem. I received low marks and the Revision is horrible.
"Me too. I wrote many articles and I received low marks. One of the comments was that the article was boring and difficult to understand, I think that is very important to understand that not all of us  belong to the same science, so we have to be respectful with everybody. I'm agree with lingdaijun and I think that the instructor or TA has to pay attention to the fairness of the peer reviewer. "
"I completely agree with you. In my case, the content not the stylish were reviewed mostly. I am really disspapointed with that, It is not what I have expected for the course. Please do something. Thank you in advance."
"Hi Sir/Madam,"
"It's really weird, I got two reviews with several 3's and several 0's...It must be a mistake on the reviewer's part, b/c they had no other comments... Very frustrating."
I have also the same problem! I cannot find an e-mail address to ask this question.
Hi
Thanks JMP1 for putting it up so assertively.
Yeah!! my peer's essay about vascular tissues of plant structures has gone missing before I could even start! Where did it go?
You need to click the Writing Assignment 1 Peer Grading link to see other's essay
"Hello,"
"For people who got zeros: I have noticed that after editing the text, for some reason the scores given above go back to 0 automatically. It's very possible that reviewers didn't see this and went on to hit \submit\"". Maybe the organization of the course can do something to fix this? Or at least give a warning, so that reviewers always check scores before submitting."""
"Yes, I did. But there is the following error messages: Invalid problem id specified: i4x://Medicine/SciWrite/combinedopenended/ba076c1a6e4246f5b767c<zipRedac><zipRedac>60<zipRedac>b27d<zipRedac>9 . Have you made any submissions for that problem? If you haven't, please try making one."
It happened to me as well!! I realized that the system had changed the scores to 3 after having eddited my fourth writting assignement. I don't know what will have happened in the three texts I had scored previously.
Basic .png image file upload doesn't seem to work very well either.
"FYI, I found a link with an email to tech support for the entire stanford online course system (i.e. not specifically for Writing to the Sciences). I emailed them with the problem. If we are lucky maybe someone there will be able to help."
"Hi.. even I am unable to get any essays for review.. everytime I click on the link on left side panel I get an error message showing- 'Invalid problem id specified: i4x://Medicine/SciWrite/combinedopenended/ba076c1a6e4246f5b767c<zipRedac><zipRedac>60<zipRedac>b27d<zipRedac>9 . Have you made any submissions for that problem? If you haven't, please try making one.'"
"The peer grading process has presented a lot of problems, including people adding new threads rather than reading what has already been posted - perhaps a more efficient discussion board divided into subject areas would prevent this. "
I am also getting the same message upon clicking that link!
"I had the same problem: reviewers 1 and 3 gave me full scores, and reviewer 3 decided to set some rubrics to 0, although that is explicitly for incomplete or blank essays. Whether it was an angry reviewer or a technical problem, I do not know. It would be nice to be able to flag strange reviews so that reviewers can reconsider their own grades, or other reviewers can invalidate it so that a new independent review is made."
The prof is using very informal langugw for the lectures.
"Hey there - I submitted my post yesterday and have since received 3 peer review scores.  I'd love to try and improve upon the posting, but **NONE** of the 3 reviewers submitted any comments whatsoever.  Is there some trick to viewing the comments about the actual essay content?  Or is it possible that all 3 of my reviewers didn't write any comments whatsoever and only graded the essay?"
I second that... The peer review has actually changed the meaning of my draft... Its my sincere request that the course staff would kindly look into the suggestions given by the peers... and specially their grades... at most of the places what was meant to be conveyed has totally been changed...
"I submitted my assignment-1 ( profile of a scientist) on Oct 22, 2013 but I am not getting peer grading. If I click it shows- invalid problem id / specified/ sequence error. Pl. help."
"Hi guys, both of you :)"
"Strangely, when I first load the peer grading page, I get a brief flash of the editing colours (pink, green...), but then they disappear."
clicking writing assignment gives this message.
"Dear course staff, HELP needed"

Experiencing issues with the peer review platform like some other students: receiving no feedback even though I finished grading; saying that I need to do four more.
"I noticed when I was reviewing essays that I filled in all the scores, did some work in another program for a minute, then came back to the essay I was working on and all my scores had reset to blank! I'm glad I noticed it before I hit submit. It is so easy to mess up the review step."

"Thank you so much Meagan. I can't speak for everyone, but it is working for me now."
Well Essay 1 submission and peer review is over. Does anybody have any idea when will the essay 2 and 3 be announced? Thanks
"I submitted my corrections above my original essay, and hit \submit\""?  Will this work?  If not, what should I have done to submit my corrections?"""
Hi Dr. <redacted> <redacted>. (Really appreciate what I've learnt in this course!). Can you possible give a head's up regarding Essay assignments 2 and 3? I would possibly like to complete things early as my internet is getting disconnected next week. Thanks!
Hi
Writers can submit a revised essay after the first submission and peer grading.
"Hi, I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Sudan. I face many technical problems that I can't solve. For example some times the quiz or assignment pages become too tiny to view. I submitted the homework that I copied from a prepared word document without being able to see how it looks like when submitted. I need some help pleae. I can hardly see what I'm writing right now"
"Hello, I can not upload the new essay, it would not let me change anything or copy the new one, help please"
what is exactly the required number of peer reviews for my article so that the feedback appear and i can resubmit my essay
<redacted>
@Rajhansa:
"No problem, Raj. Can see that you guys have your hands way more than full. :)"
thanks Raj
"This is a wonderful lecture on diagrams and graph use in manuscripts. I had to pause thrice while listening, in order to think about what I was learning. <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
"Kristin, "
thanks!
Hi Sara
Anyone knows if it's the Total score on the progress site the one that is needed for reaching the 60%?
"I have registered today, can I start today and get a certificate? Some of assignment dues have already passed. Please answer ASAP. Thank you many times."
"Hi,"
I would also like to know when the second essay will be given. 
I understand that Raj but now only three days left and I have still not got response and my chances to improve are fading away:(
"Hi, the same problem with my submission. Please, help me."
"For the same essay I got 6, 10 and 15 points :D. Where is the fairness and objectiveness of grading then? ;)"
me too
> When writing 1 single word it should always be written with lower case.</blockquote>
I think the lowest peer rate should be dropped.
"Some people are definitely have no idea how to grade the others' pieces of writing. Looking back ro the example given by the tutor, I wasn't able to give the grade less than 11 points, even if I did not understand the writing properly because of not related topic. People won't write fairytales here that are understood by everyone, so I really do not understand the reasons of giving 6 points withous serious corrections of the text..."
"I know, that I din't submit the 3rd homework on time. Nevertheless, is there any possibility to submit my answers and see the model answers, without grading, just for information? Thanks <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
Hie 
Hi! I have the same problem! What should I do? Thank you!
I am having the same problem. Any solutions??
Thanks Raj.. But I think they have extended the deadline till 29th Oct. I can only wait until then!
"Hi,"
"Hi, "
"I am sorry, but it is not what happened to my text. Please, read the description carefully. On the other hand - I am glad that you find the sourse of your problem."
"I have received this notes for the resubmited (and largely improved Writing Assignment): 15, 7 and 0! Yes it is a 0 and his/her justification:\Sorry for the poor grade but you can probably do a lot better\""!!! Well the mark should be about the submited essay and not about my potential!!!"
"Hi, I got my essay grade. But it has more mistakes. So I want resubmit other one. Can I post new essay or older one for grading? Please anybody give an answer to me."
"Hello Silvie,"
thanks..:)problem over..
I got the same error:
Thanx @ Meagan ..:)
The only quibble I would have with this is that some papers are just beyond redemption. One paper I read was so poorly written that it was impossible to figure out what the writer intended--not only was it badly structured (I think!) but the English was totally scrambled.
The median score (the middle one when arranged in order) is taken so the extremes are ignored anyway making it irrelevant whether you get straight zeros or just something lower than the other grades.
"This grading is fairly subjective so some variation will be inevitable. Personally, I wouldn't have resubmitted with an original grade of 87%. Most inexperienced graders tend to avoid maximum scores for fear of finding something better 'just around the corner'. A change of 2 points seems within a reasonable range for this type of peer evaluation."
> I feel this would be a much better way to evaluate essays.
"I was a bit disappointed with two of my graders because they actually \enhanced\"" my work by putting sentences in bad grammar.  So I did not receive any useful feedback from them but my grade was lower nonetheless."""
Have you resubmitted? The score for the resubmitted paper will count rather than the higher of the two.
"Just an additional tidbit of information: In my former field of research, high-energy physics (particle physics), the authors are **always** listed alphabetically. I don't think I have ever seen a recent (say, the past 20+ years) paper where this is different."
"I am starting now with the course, and I am expecting to enjoy it."
"Is it just me or do the peer reviews just keep coming no matter how many you finish grading? I assumed the system would issue our requisite 5 and then stop or indicate that I was done. But, when I finish one, another is immediately provided. "
"You just need to drag all your pdf in its \watched folder\"" and Mendeley can automatically search for the authors' names, title, journal, page, DOI, etc. for each pdf. In some cases, if it cannot give you these information, you can enter the DOI (or other ID of your field) yourself and it will download all those information according to that ID. I never used zotero."""
"I got a message that I had reviewed  enough to meet the requirement, but I  should feel free to do more. The text had a yellow background -- see if you got it."
I understand your feeling that I had. But please don't do this to hurt your peers.
"I got zero points in my first submission. I felt unfair, angry, disappointed..., so I posted my situation and feeling in this discussion forum for help. Later on, I realized that my zero points were obtained because of the \technical problem\"" but not \""spiteful\"" peers. I therefore suggested Dr. <redacted> to improve the system and make a reminder to all of us. Dr. <redacted> gave us a quick reply through email. She reminded us to double check the score after editing before hitting the submit button. She also said that her team has paid a lot of effort in maintaining the system which was rudimentary originally. So, I recommend that all of us please respect and appreciate their effort and give humble comments. On the other hand, I got really high grade in my second submission. One of the reasons is I tried my best to edit my passage from peers' comments. The other reason, the most important reason, is I wrote a reminder to peers at the end of my passage. I friendly remind them to double check the score before submit. If you think it is possible, please do this in your second submission. Enjoy your study."""
<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>
Would like to know if there is another option to earn a verified certificate from Stanford University itself?
same here!
"Now that I'm on week 5, I see that the idea of tackling figures and tables early is not terribly original."
"I have received this notes for the resubmited (and largely improved Writing Assignment): 15, 7 and 0! Yes it is a 0 and his/her justification:\Sorry for the poor grade but you can probably do a lot better\""!!! Well the mark should be about the submited essay and not about my potential!!! 0 should be for \""a blank or incomplete essay (unable to evaluate)\"""
I'm also unhappy that a lot of people just take excerpts from their papers/theses and submit.
What does grading 100 essays as zero accomplish?
"Yes, the system will continue to present additional, optional, evaluations so long as any remain available."
"Hi! I'm unsure on how I should proceed. I marked the \unsure about the grades\"" checkbox but I don't know what it actually does. The thing is, that the essay was longer than required and was not on any of the three given topics. How should I proceed in the future?"""
When it was unflagged this means a staff member has reviewed the content and released it back into the peer review pool. If it is again flagged this means a subsequent reviewer has flagged it again. There is clearly something which appears suspicious to your readers. Perhaps they are using the same online plagiarism checker without following up the supposed sources.
"The last grade received is the one taken, not the highest. Unless I had received a very low grade first time around I certainly wouldn't resubmit."
"Verified certificates are not offered on this platform nor, so far as I can see on Stanford's Coursera courses."
If your grades are very low then you should resubmit the essay (in full this time!). If you have got much over 60% I really wouldn't risk a resubmission as there is no guarantee the score will increase and it could still drop depending on who reviews the work.
"Sorry, I forgot to add: with reviews and comments for almost every tool (Mendeley, zotero, and others)."
"yup first draft, got it down to 700+ but 6 paragraphs is other criterion...checking to see if Word will paste into the essay submit box..."
Why do I not see a counter for the number of assignments you grade?
"As you've now doubtless observed, pasting from Word does work although formatting isn't preserved."
Mr Hardy! I had the exact same situation. Though in my case there were some other issues as well.
I'd caution though that many free plagiarism checkers take a very simplistic approach **and** do not indicate the source of the identified plagiarism. This will often result in both correctly cited quotations and the use of standard terminology a paper being marked as plagiarised.
because there isn't one...
Hi...can any staff member clarify the total grades for this course? The cumulative grades given in the progress bar of this course only adds upto a maximum of 80% (Essay is out of 50%; Homework is out of 20% and Quizzes are out of 10%). If that is the case it will be impossible to get a certificate of distinction (90%) even if we score full grades in every section.
I can't even access anyone's work to review. I emailed tech support but nothing so far :(
Well I agree with all you said except the last part ! So are you bullying the whole members or what?
"One review is bad, so 100 others have to pay the price for no fault of theirs? This is protest? Bucur, your frustration is understandable - it is irresponsible that a reviewer gives a 0 score in all sections on flimsy grounds. But the greater value of the course is in the self-improvement from the lectures and discussions."
"Prof. <redacted> has mentioned in other threads that the writing- not the topic -needs to be evaluated. \Too lengthy\"" = \""clutter\"" for the score?"""
PaulJM
Thank you for your response!
I also agree the grading system is somewhat arbitrary.   Two of my graders just gave me 2's across the board with no comments.  It seems to me they didn't even read my essay. 
"Great answer, PaulJM. LOL!"
" Send a note to the staff at <emailRedac> . Explain the problem you are having. I was having the same issue, and it was only after emailing them did they fix the problem. Good luck, I know it is frustrating!"
"I haven't yet, but I will.  Thank you!"
Thanks!
I just sent an email to the address given above about the problem.
Hi ..
You have to take the Learn to Grade session before you can score other people's assignments.  Then you have to score 4 peer assignments before you can access any grades on your own.
"Same question here, no answers yet."
"I hope that the staff members can do something about this; this is just not good at all, and I suspect it's been happening already. Why should we pay such a heavy price for someone's fault? Yes Bucur I understand your frustration, but remember that the reviewer who gave you a 0 mark, didn't negotiate that with us, so you don't have to crucify 100 of us for his/her sins."
"Which grade would count towards my final grade: the one in the first submission, the second submission or the best of them? Can somebody tell me?"
So nothing has changed and I'm still stuck with the reviews of the first submission. Anyone else still dealing with this issue?
how many did you review?
To the instructor(s):
I registered for the course long back. Something came up and I did not submit some assignments. I was able to join for 5th week. I think we can start but really not sure how grades will show up.
"Hi Alex,"
"I am not sure, but I assume I might have made a mistake, too. I rated all 5 aspects and then edited the text. Once I finished editing it, I clicked sumbit."
"Hi.. even I am unable to get any essays for review.. everytime I click on the link on left side panel I get an error message showing- 'Invalid problem id specified: i4x://Medicine/SciWrite/combinedopenended/ba076c1a6e4246f5b767c<zipRedac><zipRedac>60<zipRedac>b27d<zipRedac>9 . Have you made any submissions for that problem? If you haven't, please try making one.'"
"Hi Jonas,"
"Hi,"
"Hi there,"
"Hi, Martha! that sounds interesting! especially game studies. I am a linguist, specializing in the theory of narrative and dialogue."
I also have missed the date is there any possibility or is there any  consideration given as i wish to get a certificate for the course.
"Which grade would count towards my final grade? The one in the first submission, the second submission or the best of them? Can somebody tell me?"
"On several occasions this evening, I have accidentally navigated away from the peer review page where I had someone's essay in front of me that I was mid-reviewing. "
"It would be nice to be able to save the review as draft and add a step for \final review submission\"", so that one click would not mean sending the review right away."""
"The assigned score will be the median, the middle value when all three are placed in order"
"Hello everybody,"
"Hi there, "
"Thank you very much, CristiaN."
"I hesited a lot about replying this post but I decide to say it. I am glad that someone else think the problem with the grading system is serious. I actually posted a thread earlier than <redacted>, but got two reply saying that there are mistakes but I should be grateful, this course is a lot of work, I should read the email carefully because in it the instructor asked us to check the grading before submit, etc. Yes I complained about the problem but I didn't find my tone different from all the complaining posts. So I just delated my thread. I am not happy how I was treated, I wanted to help with improvement and wanted to remind my peers."
"By the way, where did you get this information from? Thank you!"
I have the same problem. 
I'm in the same boat as Matt--essay submitted and unable to review other people's essay.
I also do not seem to know where to look to get other essays to peer review.
"The third grader of my assignment has placed comments on the assignment quoting text, which is NOT MY Assignment. Can this be corrected? as the scores for the wrong assignment is low compared to the other 2 graders."
"It's interesting how few (if any) \protesters\"" have posted their submissions for us (peers) all to see if their claims have any validity."""
I have finished more than 4 peer reviews.
"I got curious about this paper, and I went to Pubmed and my surprise was: it is still out there! (European Journal of Endocrinology, 2002; 146:45). There is no Tag or Flag and evenworse it is FREE access. My question is: Shouldn't these people be punished some way?"
The lowest score will be dropped.
We are manually reviewing the recent flagged essays and will unflag or ban as soon as possible.
I also can't find the due date for quizzes in Unit 5.
Just keep in mind that there may be a wide range of backgrounds and learning goals in this course!
"You need to grade 4, but we don't have a counter yet (we realize this would be a good feature in the future!). So, just have to keep track."
"Also, there is an optional third essay. If you complete the third essay, the lowest of your three essay grades will be dropped. So if the distinction is important to you, this gives an opportunity to raise your grade."
Tech support is looking into the issue.
"Nice answer, PaulJM! Either of the papers described above sound fine."
Thanks for letting us know. We'll look into it.
I hope the deadline will be next week: In the reminder email was no information on this deadline and I haven't planed any time to complete the quizzes by tomorrow...
"My Progress page indicates that I have \No problem scores in this section\"" for Writing Assignment 1 Peer Grading, yet I have graded atleast 6 papers."
"Hi,"
I was flagged but I didnt make any plagarism!!!! I just summarized a paper but I didnt cut and past!!!
My essay was flagged too !!!!!without any explanation about it what do we can do ?
"Hi,"
"It is not even for my assignment, that is the point I would like to stress again. I would be happy if I receive feedback for my assignment."
Many thanks for your replies.
Many thanks for your reply.
my problem is similar with piyushi and Mandana 
 I recommend sending a note to: <emailRedac> . They responded quickly after I sent them an email describing the same problem.
"As many others I received peer reviews varying from 0 points to 3 points, and editing from changing a few words to deleting whole paragraphs. "
Has it registered all the reviews you have done? Some people are reporting issues with the total number of reviews reported being less than the number performed
"The staff will review your essay. If it does not contain any plagiarism or other inappropriate content then they will return it to the peer grading queue. In other words, you don't need to do anything to get it sorted out."
There is another interesting article along similar lines here:
"Hi,"
Exactly this. Thank you Micahela.
Hi
"First off, I want to clarify that I'm not complaining in this post. I'm only confused. My search through the already opened discussion posts did not answer my question, so I'll pose it here."
"I also meant to say that I run my essay through my university's plagiarism software, and got a 5% similarity (from the name of a reference and for some wavelengths I quoted)!"
"I can't explain it to you, but I also have some doubts about my grading. I've got 12, 11 and 4 (the third grader gave me three ceros!). Then in my progress report says 11/15."
The highest and lowest scores are ignored. That explains your grades.
Hello! 
"Same with me! I got 0/9/15. I'm baffled by the range of the scores; the first grader made some suggestions here and there, and gave me zero."
"I cant find that also, so I try to finish all the quizzes before next week."
"It's quite understandable how you feel about the irregularities in the grading system. I also had a score of 0/9/15. But \An eye for an eye\"" will only make the world full of blinds."""
"Hi!,"
"I have the same problem, I have reviewed many submission but cant see my score yet. <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
"\Because\""."""
"Although this was not my comment, it might have happen to me, too. I'm not sure."
"I graded about 4 essays, and still am seeing that I need 4 more essays graded to see my feedback,..what do I do?"
still waiting for my feedback after grading 4 peer essays and its less than 24hours to deadline....Oops!
"Does it mean, one will get zero in the assignment? and is it from all three peer reviewers? I am so worried, kindly suggest something."
"I wondered about this too, but the person giving me 0 also did not submit any edits. I also thought I would get a 5 now (and unfairly, since 0 is not true as I definitely submitted an essay and it is not plagiarized ;) ) so I was very surprised with the 12."
Staff review all flagged work and either ban (I guess you get a chance to remove problem content) or return to the pool for review by peers
The same situation! - Please help me too!
"In my case, this doesn't explain my grades, since my 'highest' is 12 and my 'lowest' is 0. I would then get a 5, but still got the 12, why?"
I got a zero note in one of the peer grades (it stands for blank paper or incompletion). I think it's unfair.
Me also !
Thank you very much!!!!!
Someone gave me 0 and said that he wasn't interested in the topic of my essay!
"Exactly the same for me! I started an essay, I lost it, I started again, I lost it again..."
The same thing. I've reviewed about 4 essays and still can't view my grade(
"If anyone is interested, I turned our first assignment, after more revision than I thought I would need, into an article that three newspapers published. Here is a link to my blog with the final version. http://vienergycarpool.blogspot.com/2013/10/destruction-of-reefs-are-virgin-islands.html"
Same happens to me. I have reviewed 4 essays and when I try to access the feedback on my own essay I get a message informing me that I have to review two more essays because I only reviewed 2 :-(
Well done on getting your article published!
Me tooo!!! help!!!
I notice in the progress section that there is meant to be a second and third writing assignment- but I can not see these described in the courseware section. Will these be launched soon? I will be very busy soon and would like to get all the work remaining for this course done this week if possible.
Up
Same problem for me: 
"Just klick on the \Writing Assignment 1 Peer Grading\"" again and the system will give you another essay. "
My self too got stuck in getting the grade for my essay. Yet I havent received any score but my friends received the grading.
"I think the peer review web form has obviously a bug, that it resets some scores to zero."
Down to 497! Wahoo!
"I only wrote and submitted mine yesterday, and have already received feedback and resubmitted. I had a couple of helpful reviewers who made editing suggestions, and a few who I thought graded fairly but didn't give me any specific feedback. I don't think the large chunk of people posting complaints realise that this is practice for us all to review and edit work as well as submit our own, and seem to have somewhat unrealistic ideologies about who is grading their work - we're all here to learn after all :) Good luck with your submission!"
One of my grading of assignment 1 contains only rubic grades (super lower than other 2 gradings) and none comments in context at all. I wonder he/she just randomly tick tick tick to view his/her own grades sooner. So irresponsible! Is there any way to withdraw that part of grades?
"I updated the peer grading page while grading an essay because the written feedback section was misfunctionning. However, the system provided a new essay (I was actually ready to grade the first one). Having a \Save grading\"" button would be great as it would also allow interruption while grading."
I have the same problem- can't get papers to peer review- HELP!!
"In all fairness, the course is scheduled to be of 4 to 8 hours per week!"
I think these are for if you want to resubmit your essays after modification.
"I haven't progressed to this lecture 7.1, so I'm unfamiliar with the backstory, but I think it's a good thing that the paper is still available. That way, the plagiarized work and the failings of the peer reviewed journal can be referenced and remembered by future researchers. Ideally, the European Journal of Endocrinology would add a header to the paper explaining that the paper is no longer valid, but is still available for reference."
How to resubmit essay 1... My essay has beer reviewed and has been flagged. I have another different essay ready to submit. since I have not been provided with a reason for the flagging i do not know what to correct in my essay.
Same here! Help please...
"I experienced the same thing like you.  One reviewer only provide me rubic grades and all the 5 questions' score were 1.  However, the best reviewer not only changed all my grammar errors but also provide a summary as following \[interesting topic, good essay, logic flow is very clear, from opening to major findings to methods and to significance. I can see that the author tried a lot of the tips learned in this course: active vioce, strong and lively verbs, punctuations and so on. Although it contains some small errors and the methods section is a little hard to understand for lay people , I enjoyed reading this essay overall.]\"".  I highest gave me 13, and the lowest gave me 5, and my median score was 9..... The gaps were too large.  I just submitted my 2nd version and I will say what happens again.  I highly appreciate those people who put their time to review the essays!"""
"Yes! It happened to me after I resubmitted my writing assignment. I would like to know if we have to review those 4 more to complete Peer Review Assignment, please?!"
WRITING ASSIGNMENT 1 - I've submitted second time after getting review but still have part progressbar of this task.  What I've done wrong?
"My thought is that the original SHOULD be included (as a block of text at the beginning), so that as peer reviewer I can see what was edited/re-written by the student."
I have the same problem... So I would be grateful for help either.
Second assignment JUST got opened. Topics are GREAT :)
"Hello, I submitted the first essay weeks ago and I still can't see my grade anywhere. Where I posted the essay the following message appears: *Your response has been submitted. Please check back later for your grade.* Has someone not been graded yet, too?"
"I know that we have three peers review, but what if they just put whatever they want? what if they just do it because is mandatory?, I think the most fair would be a second grading because their grades are really low, and this essay is worth 50% of the course."
Hi everyone!!
"Hi, "
"It was probably an inadvertent zero. As reported in a few other threads, sometimes the browser mysteriously resets the grading when editing the peer review. Sorry to hear it happened to you."
I have the same problem when trying to review the assignments.
"I'm concurrently taking <redacted> Data Analysis and <redacted> Machine Learning classes. As such, I would enjoy access to the (anonymous) peer grading data for the purposes of designing a more intelligent grading system. Just a thought. :-)"
"I received the feedbacks for my essay, 2 of them were quite promissing giving me an average of 12 points, the third feedback had a note that my essay was a quite good, I received some minor comments but in the grading I received 0 points, which reduced dramatically my score in this task."
"Absolutely agree.  I have nothing but high praise for this course and the staff; no doubt, there will be unanticipated glitches and there will always be \squeaky wheels,\"" but overall it has been a wonderful learning experience, and I am no novice writer.  The Essay 2 topics were especially heartening for a non-scientist like me.  Keep up the terrific work <redacted> et al."""
Hello.
"Where on the course site does it show you how many peer reviews you have completed? I have completed 7 reviews, but I don't see any mention of that in the course progress page or on the peer review assignment page. Instead, the peer review assignment page just continuously feeds me more peer reviews."
Thank you!
"In my case, I received no feedback, no comments, nothing, but the maximum grades. I don't think my text is horrible, but I really wanted to receive some feedback to think about it... I spent some time my editing..."
I keep getting the same error message and have posted here three times asking for help. Can someone please address this problem?
"Dear all, I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Italy."
There are well-documented technical issues with the peer grading system so reviewers apparently leaving scores of zero may not have intended to do so. If positive comments were left it seems reasonable to assume that any zero marks were inadvertent. So long as you only get one such mark it won't affect your overall score.
"I have read that the scores automatically default to zero if a reviewer flags a piece, Although I've seen no official comment, it may be that, in the event that the flag is removed after checking by staff, the zero grade is discounted."
"How did u resubmit,I have to resubmit too, but I have no idea where and how."
"HI, "
Thank you Tia
"I dont like this grading system(peer review) too irresponsible, lack of objetivity, and unfair."
"Yes, my browser has reset scores to zero many times as I work on editing an essay line-by-line; I hope that I noticed them before I hit \Submit\"""""
"Dear Staff,"
I have a couple of questions for essay 2. 
"Have the same problem, have submitted 3, and still the Assesment panel tab shows that I need 3 more"
"In the writing assignment section, you will find a 'new submission' button under the essay you've submitted. My essay was initially flagged and i did not find this button then. After it was unflagged i found this button and resubmitted my essay. But there is no grading for it to date."
same here. only 1 peer graded my first essay and the progress bar is displaying the same marks despite re submitting it. So far there's been no grading for the 2nd submission. I also notice that the replies from the instructors have become scarce. So probably we have to settle for what we got-though highly irregular and unfair. It has been a frustrating and demotivating experience.
I wonder if there is a requirement of the number of the peer grading we should do ? thanks
I have submitted my writing assignment. but not received the essay for peer reviewing. what i have to do?
"I received good comments and grade by peer review after the first submission. I appreciated the comments given by the peer and so I incorporated the same in my final submission. Will my essay be rated again. And if yes, then would you consider the previous grades if the second set of grades is not that good.Kindly let me know."

I have the same problem! Can someone tell me what to do and confirm my first submission?
I reviewed 4 n it says 0. :(.
Dishonest is a very emotive word that I don't feel applies-we are all aware of problems with the system so it is just as likely that a system error meant the review was submitted without feedback or the reviewer pressed submit without meaning too
Only the score for the second submission will count towards the final score
Would you prefer to wait months (years?) for staff to grade your work? Peer review and automated marking are the only way that these free online courses can possibly operate. If you want staff to mark your work then I guess you need to find a course with fees. 
Thanks.
I guess that your essays simply haven't been reviewed by enough people yet
"Have you successfully submitted your own work? You can't review until this is done. If yes, then others suggest contacting the tech support via email works"
Staff review all flagged essays. You have used both submissions so will have to wait for the outcome of staff checks
I have the same problem after I successfully submitted my essay... Can't get other essays for grading.
Hello? Need help with writing assignment 1. I just submitted my work but I forgot to add my references. Is there a chance to add it still since there is still a couple of hours before submission?
"Hi,"
Just to make sure: Are there deadlines for answering the quiz questions?
"Hello, I submitted essay 1 yesterday but I'm not able to start the session \learning to grade\"" because of this problem: "

Maya stood transfixed staring blankly at the enormity of the imposing and complex structures at Jantar Mantar. The distant blaring honks and motor sounds of the chaotic Delhi traffic gradually faded further as she continued to look ahead at the 17th century astronomical instruments trying to decipher the complexity of the concrete observatory tools.

"Please, extend the time! I was not aware of the great time difference in my country and I missed the hour. I want to complete the homework 3 to have good grades. Thanks."
please help me.. i have resubmitted the essay.. but grading did not change.. it shows the same old one.. anyone had a similar problem?
I've had the same problem for the past 4 days. I sent them an email about it and they haven't replied yet. When is it going to get fixed? Beats me..
Edit and resubmit.
"I agree with you, Micahela. The system provides you with three reviews, so that you have a higher chance of getting at least one that is helpful."
"One helpful review out of three is good enough, IMHO, and the very point of having three reviews."
Good point.
"\and I have every right to nag too\"""
I would like to keep all the changes made by my reviewers. How can I do it?
I totally agree!!!
"Hello, i am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, according to the instructions i have posted my discussion and got 11 for 15 and after which i included the comments from peer reviewers and re-submitted again but there is no review done but the instructions showed me that the review is finished. Please let me know regarding this. "
Thank you. I will check APA.
Maybe you are too late.
"It is in the Courseware section, search it closely if you missed it."

Hi! 
"I don't know...deadline for submitting Essay1 was 29/10/2013 I did it on 28/10/2013, while the deadline for peer review is 01 Nov 2013...."
A single low score won't affect your grade anyway as it's the median that is used
"The same is true in economics - my field, and other social sciences."
The peer review option is the second one when you select writing assignment 1 in the courseware page
I didn't make a second submission as I was happy with first score- it is perfectly acceptable to do this
"I completed my essay and did 4 peer reviews. Then I read the comments from others who reviewed my paper, did corrections and resubmitted it. "
"Hey, do you know if I can download the videoas and play them later after the course has ended again? Which player do I need? I tried to download the videoas but I cannot play them... Thnaks for help!"
Use the arrows at the top of the feedback area to scroll through the three reviews of you work
"Yes, refreshing the page helps and provides us with another essay to review."
"In one peer grading  I didnt have a constructive feedback, they write its not completely clear and so on but they dont make comments. I really took a while to revise properly the essays i had to peer so it would be nice to at least have a constructive feedback."
"Dr. <redacted>, I hope you are enjoying this run by the Red Sox. One win away!"
"Kristin, "
If you resubmit you have to do four more revisions to receive a new grade.
"Homework and assignments have dead lines, but not the quizzes."
In the explanation of the assignment this is clearly stated.
For peer reviews. We have this information in the document: *Detailed Instructions for Writing Assignment 1*
I cant see essays to grade.
"Could you please provide me with the reference for the review about CASP used as an example? The reference on the video is too small on my screen. Thanks, <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"

"Towards the end of the interview, Efron speculates on the future of peer reviewed journals. He feels that they will always be necessary because someone has to edit and verify the validity of submitted papers. Could that process be crowd-sourced? Not only would crowd-sourcing be far cheaper, it would be faster and ultimately a better arbitration process."
"I want to express my annoyance regarding peer-editing, corrections evidently intended to modify completely the original ideas of the text. If I accept the suggestions made in the editing of the text, would have to lie about what the author of the text actually said."

Look at the comments at the beggining of this thread for a solution. Hope it works! ;-)
"Some peers posted exactly the same messages (at least 5 times) in this forum. These messages are almost their personal problem, such as missed the deadline for doing homework. I know that they want to ask for help. But, this attitude is quite selfish, because they affect other peers to search for the useful information. I warmly remind them please be considerate."

"Hi,"
"To err is human! Chances are there that without grading the essay one hits the submit button soon after completing the written feedback, for the button is very close by. Placing the  score section in between the feedback and the submit button might address this issue. Another possible cause for the low scores might be because of the guidelines given: We expect you will assign grades of \2\"" more often than the grades of \""1\"" or \""3\""."""

"It happened to my essay, too. Only 3 peers graded it, and one of them didn't put any grade nor any comment. I worried in the beginning but calmed down when I got clarification about the grading system."
"Hi all,"
"If I'm not coming out too greedy, I'd like to team up with and review all of you. I have contacted Gift, as he put out his e-mail, but if you'd like to post yours as well, I'll get in touch. I agree with you, OliK79, that reviewing interdiciplinarily is a great benefit."
"I'm using a mac and everytime I hit \Delete\"" on my keyboard to cross out while editing. the page refreshes and I lost everything :(. And I'm not even sure if then that student essay got garbage or half edited content?"
"I don't know if this has happened to anyone else, but I thought I should mention it. While editing essays, I was automatically redirected to the next essay several times. Fortunately, it was after providing marks, but in no case was I finished editing and providing commentary. Two things comncern me about this - the first is that those people whose essays I was marking have missed out on feedback, and the second is that I may need to edit a large number of essays just to cover the 3 (?) required to get a statement of accomplishment. Feedback please..."
I have  the same problem with the peer review section!!!! My essay is submitted on time. What can we do?
I have the same problem . What can we do?
"Hi, "
"There's another post RE emailing Stanford IT support.  I did that, but no response yet.  <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>."
The Manuscript was limited to 25 pages.  That will translate to under 10 pages in print. :) <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>
I also get the same error code.
I can not peer review any work.

"hey there,"
"I usually find myself using 1.5 speed a lot when Kristin talks about things that either seem obvious to me or that have already been explained sufficiently before. I think both 1.5 and 0.5 work pretty well and can help comprehension, so I'm really happy to have that possibility to change the video speed."
"I have finally finished my peer grading, however, it has really been hard to do it. At least five times my reviews have been lost because the screen has switched unexpectedly before I had finished entering my comments. The result has been that I have lost a lot of time but, what worries me more, is that I have not been able to include as many comments as I would have wished (as I ended up trying to finish the edition quick enough to avoid losing it altogether). "
I'm not sure if I have the same problem.. but I guess it's similar in some ways.
I had the same problem yesterday :(
"I submitted my essay and peer's reviews but I didn't received my review essay. Also, there is not essay 1 mark on the progress. What mistake did I do?"
"I did more than 4 peer grade  submissions, but I can't see my feedback and there show a message saying that I did not even one."
I believe there is an optional 3rd essay? What are the requirements for this essage and how does one submit this?
I can not access the peer review items for the writing assignment one. There is an error message stating that I have an invalid ID.
"I had the same problem about the peer grading. I did more than 8 rewiews, but there is no one computed."
"I've submitted my 2nd writing assignment and there is not the options to resubmit the text, nor the peer grading option. Could you check this?"
"I had this problem from the other side.  I read an excellent paper and gave the author all 3s.  When I clicked submit, in a flash I saw the grades change to 1s and 2s!!  The author will be very surprised since I included a comment that his essay was interesting and a joy to read."
"Just thought that I should add a web address, in case anyone is interested in including colorblind-safe figures and presentations in their manuscripts."
Agreed. Some of our classmates have also posted disrespectful and condescending threads in the discussion forum. We don't learn from insults. Let's help each other.
Greetings from Colombia
Professor The second essay is different from the first one? I mean the topic has to be different hasn_t it?
Can you check back to see if you can access the peer grading page now?
You need to submit your own essay before you begin the peer grading process!
"If you submitted your essay, it's in the queue, and will be graded by your peers soon  (the deadline for peer grading is tomorrow). You will be able to access your feedback as soon as the required number of peer graders have reviewed your submission!"
"Your essay will receive the middle score from your 3 peer reviewers. The lowest score will not be counted. Thus, if you received an unfair peer review (such as getting all zeros), this will not be counted."
You can submit the (optional) third essay to make up for missing the deadline!

Thanks for answering.
Great to hear that! Thank you for the reply!
I just registered today in this course and I want to submit my answers for the previous homework but the settings won't allow me because the deadline is closed. Can I enroll again in this course so that I'd be able to get a certificate?
"My reviews seem to have gone through. Today as I looked for a grade I saw the reviews of my own work. As a conclusion: If the state is \Waiting to be graded\"" or something like this, everything should be ok, and you just didn't receive all your reviews yet."""
"well, I think being greedy is not the worst thing in this context ;-)"
"Michaela, I thought it was a tech glitch, too. Some of the repeating posts also had repeating responses. I felt it was possibly a glitch in some maintenance program doing routine copy paste operations, and somehow got out of sync."
"On one side you instruct participants to summarize any \hot paper\"" and on the other side your review does not accept it.In recent submission I've summarized one such paper. But to my \""utter displeasure\"" the reviewer has got all the scores zero , in spite of the fact that I've given the full references from where I have summarized the article."
Me too I am having problem with the pear grading. I almost finish one but my internet connection failed and nothing that I was editing remain and now it showing me a different assay!
"I also graded more than 4 essays after I had submitted my one essay, but the progress bar in the \Writing Assignment 1\""-section indicates that there is still something to do. Can someone tell me what it is? Thanks!"""
Please clarify and solve my problem.
"As long as you don't hit the submit button no changes will be made. I had a similar problem with the editor. I tried to delete using the backspace key, but the browser interpreted it as \backward\"". All of the editing was gone, and I got a new essay assigned to me. I think editing outside is no good either, as I think this will get everything striked through and all of the text inserted in green color at the end."
thanks reta
Thanks Rajhansa. I am happy with my score then. 
"Hello, i have allready review 4 peers on the second deli ery of the draf and I still can not see my note, what can i do thanx you"
It probably hasn't been marked yet so no score available to show on progress page
yes
I also graded more than 6 essays but the system is not able to register the progress.
It seems to be fine.
me too. I have waited for many days. still can't...today is the deadline for assessment... what should i do?? :(
Same fore me here.
"My comments were in no way meant as a criticism of the course, the staff or even the system; I merely expressed the opinion that it was unlikely that these multiple posts were deliberate and hoped that the staff would somehow be able to de-clutter the discussion board. "
Incidentally - you are able to delete your own posts so if staff can't remove them perhaps some of the posters will
I am having the same problem. I grade more then 4 essays but the system not registered my progress.
Excellent!
"I just checked my grades from the peer review. I found it is ridiculous that some of them didn't gave any comments but only low grades. If these people really think my writing needs to be improved, why don't you write down your opinions? Or you didn't really read the writing but only want to finish your job? I do think these people are really irresponsible."
Thanks very much :)!
"Ha ha... in that case you will need to get the spelling changed, as that's what might appear in the Statement of Accomplishment."
"Haha, I see! Thanks for pointing that out!"
Don't worry - the score used in your grading is the median one so the low one won't count
"I have reviewed 4 assignments, but system shows only 3. Why? Do I have to review  5th work?"
"Dear Team,"
I have used Endnote and Mendeley. I much prefer Mendeley as I can access it from any computer (including my iPad).
excuse me. I don't know how to highlight the pear grading to grade it. Could you show me please :(
"Hi, I have a question. If my first essay score was 67% (10/15) why in total there is a 16.7% of a 50% possible? I don't understand the conversion of percentages here."
"Hi, I was revising some essay (clarity, style, etc.) and I clicked on next button... so, when I saw the new writing on my window I got back to edit the first essay but the essay wasn't there... When I refresh the page, second writing wasn't there and I saw a new writing... Maybe I've given zero to this students... What can I do to change this?"
"In my assignment feedback area, I receive the \Feedback not available yet\"" message, because I \""need to peer grade 3 more submissions\"". I have graded 3 submissions (plus one that was in my opinion plagiarism) and the system states that \""You have graded responses from 1 students\"". **Any idea what causes this lack of evaluation count update?**"
i have submitted my essay and its peer grading showes flagged?? what does that mean?
I've submitted the 4 peer reviews but it shows that i didn't review any responses. What should i do?
"Firstly, the peer review process itself is perhaps inevitable, but flawed nonetheless. I got 15, 12 and 5 from the 3 reviewers. I shall completely ignore the last grader, and his/her actually erroneous comments, but I can't help thinking it might have been two of them. "
That's right!!! hahaha!!! thanks!!
"They do not answer me. I submit my first work one day before deadline, and after that \wait for the grade\"" and the \""error\"" messages appear. Then I submit my second work and it appear immediately in the Assessment panel. I am very dissapointed - tomorrow is the deadline but I have not the chance to peer review and get points for that assessment :((("""
"I am on ipad, but I have the same problem on the computer. I think it seems to be delay in the submission phase."
"Hi Raj, where did you find that info that the lowest score will be dropped?Is it official? I really need to know , because if not I don't think I will manage to finish the course successfully, unfair grading here as well..."
Do you have that message
"I am very happy. My response to the paper: \Challenges posed by the global crisis in the health workforce\"" was accepted and published. You can see it at [bmj][1] "
"The same thing. But in the ropic it says \You need to peer grade 3 more submissions in order to see your feedback. You have graded responses from 1 students\"""
"I can't find them either..but in the latest course update, the teacher wrote that the peer review will be available from november 1st..so I think that will be able to peer-review tomorrow!"
Staff state that it's the middle (median) score that counts so the grade you state appears to be correct
I have the same issue -- they gave me a '0' in clarity and a '3' for everything else!
"I have the same \waiting to be graded status\"" on my essay."
I think there is some kind of problem with the program. The first paper I reviewed was excellent - I scored it 3's across the board. I wrote a couple of comments and checked the scores before I hit submit and it had changed one to 0!! I fixed it then submitted but I also put in my comments the score that I had given the person in case there was some issue. The same score change happened on at least one other paper.
"Thank you for your reply Micahela, but, I regret to say, this is messed up.  It's simply not good enough."
Due to some issues I was not able to submit essay 1. when i pressed the submit button it was 17 minutes late.
"I appreciate your frustration and it is shared by many as you will see if you scroll through the board here. Please bear in mind that, along with grades changing during editing, those doing the reviews come from a wide variety of backgrounds and are probably, like me, learning to review as we go along. There's really no other way for a free course like this to operate and, although it may lead to some frustration, I think that there are far fewer people complaining than there are participants."
"They will be available from November 1st! I'm waiting, too! =)"
Raj is staff DianaA
"I believe that this is some sort of glitch with the review process.  During my peer review, I had meant to give a person a '3' and leave comments.  However, after I left my comments those '3's had been reset to '0's.  For reviewers, make sure to double check your scores before you submit!"
"Congratulations, Emilio!"
"I got several 0, it's an awful system."
"Same here, I got two zeroes, really disappointed on the system."
I also got two zeroes on clarity and concision.
"Hi, I was looking through Springer's page for some author instructions and I found they are offering some online training in scientific writing. Although I don't think it will be as comprehensive as this course, it may be a nice way to complement the material."
"Yes I've been using them too! Its good to know there are other spanish-speaking students in the course, maybe we can review each others papers in spanish if needed!."
As the essay score is made up from the best two of three you will be able to submit when the option to submit a third essay is opened
And my
"Dear staff,"
"Hi everyone, "
Thank you for sharing the link Isaac.
"Staff, I agree with this post. I have an impression that the system is in a Beta mode. During my peer reviews I noticed that one Rubric--clarity--changed from \2\"" to \""0\"". I have read other posts on this same issue, so I was keen to go back and check prior to submitting the review."""
"I can't complete peer essay grading.j After scoring essays, I can't write in written feedback box & error occurs. Please help."
Same problem here.
"Hello,"
"I have received constructive feedback on my essay, see the points being made, and feel they were correct in their assessments. Giving and receiving feedback has been an invaluable learning process. Much appreciated to all!!!"
"I am having a similar issue. I cannot get an essay to even show up to review. It gives some sort of error statement. I will try again, but I am worried since the due date is tomorrow. This is what shows up:"
Congratulations! I would love to read it!
Maybe just copy the original introduction first stating in parentheses and then your own version below that.
"With respect to the discussion, would it be a good idea to include the questions posed in the Introduction, so the reader found it easy to know how those questions were answered?"
"Thank you so much! I understood that the 1st essay was 50%, and I was wrong..."
"Hi, thanks for answering. I was looking at the total course, not essays."
Thank you ricolo. Submit at the end of the course...so I guess instructions will follow?

Hi!
Hi!
"I agree! I also gave an incorrect answer, but a simple calculation shows there must be a mistake here..."
I think so.
"Hellow, please help, I have submitted my assigning but I can't access the scoring rubric, therefore, I can't score and can't get my mark. Thank you."
"Everyone deserves a score of 100% in their own eyes... As much as I despise the 'peer' assessment system (mainly because we are not peers at all), you should be quite pleased with your score given that the average score should be about 10. "
"Hi Patricia, I hear you too. Definitely a sad hater or an irresponsible student. Indeed, these people who gave low scores normally left without comments. But the people who spent time on the editing of our writing gave high marks. Hope we will be lucky for the next essay. :)"
"Well, I've got only 1 peer review, which gave me 2 in everything without any comment."
"I have submitted my essay, but I cannot see the peer review grading. Today is 1st of November, is there anybody there to have got the peer reviews? Need help?thanks.Mona"
"Hi. In percents, how much does it worth writing assignment 2?"
I have the same problem!
"So what you're saying is that, if my 3rd grader had given me all 0's, I should be even more pleased with my grading, because my average should have been 9. Makes perfect sense Ruben. "
"When I click on \submit\"" I see a comment \""The problem close date has passed, and this problem is now closed\"" Could I submit my essay 1 afterwords?"""
me too same I am unable to open any quiz sections till now. pl. help and guide
I appreciate that but when this course is offered free to a world-wide audience how else do you expect it to work?
"Hello friends,"
"I've just seen the grades of essay 1, and I want to thank the peers that have taken this task seriously, making constructive criticisms and making me realise my mistakes. I've also noticed that some others don't take the peer review so seriously (I've got 3 true reviews and another one with 0 in every category and no comments to justify it). I know the system isn't perfect but either way, it's not cool when some people really work on something and some others don't put their effort on it."
"Dear Prapti, I also had this problem. Click courseware and Click on the unit. Look for sub titles like 'examples of what not to do'. Near the sub title is a small clock. CLick on the sub title, then move your cursor in the main header area. There are 2 subsections. The one on the right has the quizzes when you click on it."
"This is great news! Just a question, what is the solution when one has received two low grades? For example 4, 7 and 15? Is the final score the average of the last two? Or the score in between as I read somewhere?"
Sorry  I can't answer that - I suspect someone ran it through an online checker and found the original text so marked it up. The essay doesn't give your name so it plagiarism would appear to be valid assumption even if it is your own work. The final decision will be the staff's but they may well check anonomously too.
"I tried to submit the assignment on time, but due to some error it was not accepted. Can I resubmit?"
"Hmmm, how long before the deadline did you submit your work? I raised a question about what would happen if there weren't enough reviewers for the remaining work. Perhaps the system simply gives whatever marks are available once the reviewing deadline has passed - all comments being guesswork of course"
I'm not sure what accepted protocol is on this but my gut reaction would be to do a literature search to see if it has already been noted/corrected or to contact the corresponding author so they are able to revise the original
Thanks. :-)
then the grade will be the middle one -  7
"Hi,"
Humm... ok.... I am not sure I am a big fan of the median of 3 samples...  I know that there is not much of a choice for a class such as this but I am not certain that my work is a 6/15...  It is better than that. I would certainly not state my work 15/15 but if I had to self assess after the feedback I received I would give myself at least a 10 or 11... I am very curious as to the total distribution of grades to see where I ranked and what the possible uncertainty is on the median of the summed values from a likert scale.
"Because, when you finish these two essays, if you are unsatisfied with one of them you can rewrite it for possible better grade."
I can't seem to find my peer reviews.  The first one that came up was a perfect 15 then I clicked on something and now I can't find any of them.  The problem is I received a score of 10.  Unless the other reviewers scored me incredibly low I don't see how this is possible.  Where do I go to check these peer reviews?  I certainly don't deserve a 10!  My essay was very well written.
"Try to write your second essay as best as you can, and you will have another chance to fix your first, because you can rewrite one of the two if you are unsatisfied."
Great idea!
Well done!
"Unfortunately you can't change it, but the student's final grade will be the average of the two highest scores received so if you've accidentally given a low score it hopefully shouldn't matter too much. Lots of people have reported the same problem here."
"I believe there has been a genuine mistake by my grader while marking scores. At the end of my assignment, grader 2 included the commment [Very well written, clear,  and interesting! All the best!] However,I have been marked 1 for clarity and concision, making my score 11. I believe this is a genuine mistake and could affect my score by atleast 2 points. Is there any way to fix this? My other scores add up to 1<zipRedac> and 12. I would really appreciate it if this could be fixed because this could drastically affect my overall grade in terms of percentage."
"I submitted my work I think two days after the assignment was out, to have as much time as possible for a resubmission, as suggested by the instructor. That's why I'm so pissed off now."
"The course information says that essays will be available for reviews on November 1, but there is nothing on the left side of the page. I have aleady submitted my essay and was hoping to start reviewing today. Is it only my problem or is it like this with everyone else?"
"There in fact has to be some rounding, but not within individual reviews. You get the average of the two best peer reviews, so if you get 12 from one reviewer and 13 from the other that would be 12.5, and that's not possible. The system then gives you the lower of the scores, I can confirm that."
"I think that was the cause for the hint to submit early. If you submit early enough before the deadline, you can receive your reviews before the writing deadline is reached and resubmit. I didn't submit early either, but I knew that I would only have one shot because of this."
"Interesting, thank you!"
"Ah, sorry, misunderstood the system! Of course, for the median no rounding is needed."
"I have a similar problem with you, except that I can't read the 4 peer reviews then (I didn't review others yet); there are now 3."
"I submitted yesterday also my second one, so I will wait and see."
"I also left the messageboxes full of greens and reds when I reviewed, but received few myself. But don't be upset, people left few comments maybe because they didn't think your essays have any flaw; I mean, you did so much in your work and even got a master of english to revise it, there's no way your writing can be scored poorly!  I was chased by another deadline (to write a report)then and didn't devote much in this writing, now your works are making me more uneasy =P"
I have the same problem. I have assessed the 4 peer essays and got a message: New grades have been returned. What should I do?
There are lots of reports about this throughout the discussions Scott
"OliK, numerous staff posts have stated that it is the middle of the thee (the median) score. There is no calculations involved"
"Thank you, I was confused with that one too."
"But don't worry, you get a chance to submit a third essay later"
"Tempi, I agree with you. The lowest score I had given was 2. And I edited as much as I could and left comments. "
Sorry to hear you feel that way. I'm enjoying the challenge and have found my writing to have improved already
That's a very sensible attitude
I don't feel that there is any need to identify your self. All tasks simply require the production of a revision or new piece of writing. Even if you chose to re-write your own work you need to avoid plagiarism (see unit 7.1)
"I noticed this problem as well.  I caught it after the writing assignment I peer reviewed.  I made sure the numbers were marked as I intended before I clicked \submit\"".  However, I think the first paper I peer reviewed might have accidentally gotten all zeros.  This is most definitely not what I intended.  How can we fix this???"""
"For option 4 or 5, how should the letter be signed? Real name? In which case it becomes single-blind for review, or pseudonym? In which case it becomes double-blind for review."
"It might not be the grader's fault.  A software glitch appears to be changing the number grades while peer reviewers are making comments.  In last five of the six writing assignments I peer reviewed, I went back to check the number grades after I finished making my comments.  The numbers grades had changed as I was typing in my edits/comments.  Invariably, the numbers were always lower than the grades I had given.  In one case they were changed to all zeros.  Something similar to this may have happened in your case."
How to come back to already graded essay? I have problems with my computer and accidentally I matched not what I wanted...
I agree with you. In theory. 
"International Relations and Economics, Development, Policy Papers and such."
"I had received the peer reviews of my first essay, but I clicked on a button to try to correct and resubmit, because I thought the deadline had been reopened for resubmission because the option was enabled. But my peer reviews disappeared after that."
My assignment 2 has been graded by a single peer instead of 3 (atleast that's what it shows). Also the peer review and edit is not available and only the grades are shown. Did anyone else find this?
I haven't even received any peer reviews yet. I think there is a backlog in the system.
"I'm very disappointed in the peer review process of this course. In addition to the ample amount of computer glitches causing students to get 0's and 1's on their essays, I believe the grading system is very unfair. I received a perfect score from one reviewer, a very low score from another (which I'm assuming is due to computer error considering my reviewer stated that they enjoyed my essay in the comment section), and a low score without any feedback whatsoever from my final reviewer. This means my final grade will be low, despite 2 reviewers actually liking my essay; my third reviewer was apparently just lazy and grumpy. I spent hours carefully reviewing 4 essays, revising them, and providing ample feedback. I feel like I'm putting in a lot of work to help others but I'm not getting any feedback on my own writing (which I thought was a major component of the course). I'm sure other students feel the same way. Additionally, questions and concerns about the course software and computer problems are not being addressed in a timely fashion."
Where can I find the four essays that I need to review?
Where on the website can I find the essays I need to review?
I have a quick question;  I did the writing assignment and submitted it on time.  I then completed the peer reviews and received my corrections back.  I edited it after seeing that the assignment was due on November 1st (which is today) and then went to resubmit it and there is no longer the November 1st deadline.  I apologize I was just rather confused at the deadline submission and was under the impression we could submit our final writing assignment up till today.  Is that correct?  Or was the final submission on October 29th?
Where on the science in writing course website can I find the four essays I need to review?
You have to be patient.
I believe the deadline for the assignment was the 29th and the deadline for the peer reviews was today
"Hopefully, you represent the 'silent majority'!"
Thanks a lot for your valuable advice.
"Hey, I received an answer to my mail a few hours ago and the problem is solved now... and the deadline extended, as you may have already seen! "
"Thank you very much, I guess there is some trouble with the grading system, as I've seen other posts complaining about the same issue."
"Apart from that, maybe I should complain also about my reviewers don't giving any feedback, as some other people have done yet. If they can't give explanation for flaws in the essay, why shouldn't they give a grade 3?"
Thanks :)
"Dear colleagues I have just joint the class yesterday and submitted my assignment and got 14, I am not smart but I have read a lot about writing in science. Do you think I still have the chance to earn the certificate, or it is too late?!"
"Take it easy, it is fun and continuous education experience that it should all about. I myself very new to grade someone's scientific writing, it is difficult to be 100% fair although I wish that, but we are here to learn. Tasting the article and give a critique is very technical and subjective process even you tried your best at this level. I had the same same experience: one peer very degraded my work without constructive comment, and the other one's comment was very informative. And I myself degraded someone for the topic being very technical, rough and hard to follow for example although I wished to give him or her 3 in all sections. I did my best to be honest and I am here to learn."
now seems they changed a bit...
"I got a lazy reviewer too. He/she just made every item a 2, and left no comment at all."
me the same.
"Eh...sorry to reply a month later, but I posted the question then because the prof. made this \correction\"" in cutting the clutters, so..."""
" I want to join you! I'm a undergraduate majoring in biology, and my email is <emailRedac> "
"I have noticed that, after assigning a score, if I click on the scroll bar at the right border to see the rest of the score-sheet, the score changes to the nearest sentence level."
I know it's silly to ask so....But they keep reminding me there might be updates when none actually is new when I click it open...
"Before I assessed others, the system told me there were 4 for me, and in the end I can only find 3."
"And they can't recognize double-byte symbols. I forgot to switch my input software, and symbols like \?\""just jumped into the passage as \""fused\"" in (with no green or red), and there's no way I can redo it..."
Yes a lot of the low grades that don't seem to match the comments are probably due to technical issues. Reviewers should always check the grades assigned before hitting submit.
YOU NEED TO GIVE THE FEEDBACK ON AT LEAST 3 ASSIGNMENTS THAN ONLY YOU CAN VIEW YOUR OWN GRADES. ONCE YOU HAVE DONE THAT THE EXCLAMATION MARK BESIDES ASSESSMENT PANEL WILL DISAPPEAR.
How can I use the option of third assignment to complete my assignments.
"I did review 4 students' in peer assignment, and can see the reviews I recieved...but the mark was still there"
"I was grading an essay and, to my horror, noticed that the points I had just given, turned into zeros! It was lucky I didn't press \Submit\"". So, everyone, after you have edited an essay, check whether the grades are still there!"""
"Dear staff members,"
Did you submit assignment 2 or your edited assignment 1? If so then you need to review another 4 essays
You're welcome and glad you're feeling better now :)
And remember that this applies to every submission so if you edit and re-submit you need to do another 4
We have to review 4 essays for every one we submit however each essay is only reviewed by 3 peers so there should be 3 scores for each submission
I CAN BET ON IT THAT YOU WOULDN'T FIND IT ONLINE ANYWHERE. YOU CAN CHECK IT THROUGH ONLINE CHECKER OR WHAT SO EVER. PEERS WITHOUT EVEN READING THE TEXT JUST THEY MENTION IT. I SUGGEST TO BE PLEASE FAIR ENOUGH THAT WE CAN PARTICIPATE FURTHER.
"AND PEER REVIEW DOESN'T DEPENDS ON ASSUMPTIONS AND ITS NOT ANY COPY PASTE MATERIAL, I HAVE SELF WRITTEN IT."
"I agree too. Spent a lot of time making revisions and putting comments, and just 1 person bothered to grade my assignment, putting very low grades and no feedback at all."
"Yeah, well actually I posted my assignment the moment it was announced (like within an hour) as surprisingly I was already working on a manuscript so I had the material ready. I knew there wouldn't be anyone for me to review so soon (as I did not think there would be many if any at all who submitted the assignment right then, and for the same reason I wouldn't also be able to grade anyone else as there would be nothing for me to grade). However 1 day later I was surprised to see my progress panel showing my grade for assignment 2 (I had not peer graded anyone else and still couldn't according to edX- I assumed I can receive my grades only after I peer reviewed other people and so I was surprised to receive my grade so soon). However I could not see any edits (The whole peer edited section of the edX platform is missing from the page) or grades from more than 1 peer. Just a single grade from a single peer."
"Mine has been flagged but I don't know why, I did an edit of an original manuscript so I'm guessing that is why but as you say, it is an edit not a complete re-write so some of it IS the same as the original."
See here:
See here:
So if it hasn't been published to be searchable online then it should be okayed by staff and released for grading. 
Thanks again.
"You are able to still submit two assignments, do the quizzes and take the final exam-only the homework and assignment 1 are closed.  I think that's worth about 80% of the results so although you can't get a distinction a certificate of completion is a possibility"
I did not answered( b)& (c) both. I answered in I attempt (c) When it was marked wrong only then in second attempt I marked (b). Two attempts are allowed. Please rectify the error in score . I shall be thankful.
Just to add a related grading query - I received 2 reviews yet the third review indicated that my assignment was blank and I receive 0 for all rubric constructs!  Are the scores calculated as the average of 3 peer grades?
"I am lost-- I see one peer-review score but no edits or comments to explain their ratings.  I also see two other peer-reviews, both with ZERO scores and no explanations or comments.  Was I flagged?  If so, how would I know this?  In the Open Problems section it just takes me back to the essay I submitted. "
Thanks!
"There is a problem with this video: I can not run it (I've tried several times over a couple of days, with no result)."
"Well, I got one excellent review, with lots of good points on how to change my essay,together with a high grade. The other two left hardly any comments/corrections, but they also left very high grades."
"For my first Assignment 2 peer review I edited the text, made my comments, entered the numerical scores, reviewed the text again,  made one more text comment, then scrolled up to look at the grades one more time. I was horrified to see that the two \3\"" scores I had made had jumped to become \""1\""s. Luckily I was able to correct them and then hit submit, but the experience has given me new respect for those feeling the pain of what seem to be unintended bad scores. "
So--I just tried to resubmit an edited version of my original assignment because I assumed that I got a zero on the submission and the resubmit button was open for me.  But when I deleted the old version and tried to submit an edited version-- I am now told I am past the due date.  
"I just reported the same thing-my scores of 3 jumped to 1! I had time to fix before final submission, thank goodness for the person whose work I was reviewing."
"Yep, the grades I just gave changed twice, from 3's to 1's. You need to recheck them after every change you make."
"Your essay will receive the middle score from your 3 peer reviewers. The lowest score will not be counted. Thus, if you received an unfair peer review (such as getting all zeros), this will not be counted."
"Apologies, I thought I had replied to your post, but I think there were some issues with the discussion forum that have now been resolved. To answer your questions:"
"You need a total score of 60% or above at the end of the course to get the certificate, so I definitely think that you can do it!"
You may find Prof. <redacted>'s post on the forum helpful:
You should be able to access the Essay 2 Peer Grading section now!
That may be because the system is set up so that your essay will receive the middle score from your 3 peer reviewers.
You can ignore the exclamation mark! 
"Students with flagged essays require an instructor or TA review. If the essay has no inappropriate content or detectable plagiarism, then the essay will be returned to the peer review queue for grading. We will try to resolve these as fast as possible."
Absolutely!
OK-- but that doesn't really teach me anything  about improving my writing.  It sort of shoots my confidence when I don't know whether this was a technical glitch or my peers truly thought my essay was an abomination.
"I'm glad now that the Course Staff postponed the deadline for peer reviews, and so my essay submission was considered and I was able to do the reviews."
Yes that is a good idea! If the grading section was after editing it would help.
It's very kind of you! We students always love learning... no matter how we've been evaluated. And indeed it's another opportunity to learn.
"I have submitted my essay 2 successfully but at the learn-to-grade process, the submit button is not working after I fill in the appropriate grade choices for the learning essay. This process worked fine with the first essay learn-to-grade but I'm using a different wifi system this time (traveling overseas). Any suggestions?"
I was trying to do the peer review for the 2nd assignment and the submit button is not working . i tried twice ended up with the same result. how do i submit the peer review please help
I've found 2 situations:
"Home works closed some time ago as did the first written assignment. It is still possible to get 80% from the quizzes, assignments plus the final exam"
"I wrote 2nd Writing Assignment, I got grades, that didn't satisfied me so I made new submission, I also made peer gradings. Unfortunately I got back exactly the same Written Feedback. Is it a mistake of system or I need to wait few days and it will be changed?"
"I don't think your question has been answered - I have read from other posts that the later submission's score counts, which in your case is 14. If you're not happy with it though, you can submit your essay again (or a whole new essay) towards the end of the course as the optional essay 3. After that your two highest essay scores will count to your final overall grade."
"I think it is an technical issue because i am also experiencing weird things. I have 2 evaluations, both with good grades but no editing text."
Hello Everyone!
Thanks for clearing that up.
"Dear Professor <redacted> <redacted>, I'm very grateful to you for useful tips - both in lectures and comments - I'm to share with my students and colleagues"
I would like to know how long you had to wait until you received the results from peer grading. 
"Thanks, Rajhansa."
"Me, too."
Dear Ms.<redacted>
And there is always Google Scholar for getting a nice cut-and-paste reference in the three most common formats.
"Well my grader gave me 1's throughout but leaves a comment : \good essay. thanks!\"" "
"Personally, I would go so far as to say that the discussion forum implementation is vile.  Coursera's is much better.  But on the other hand, the last two Coursera courses I've had have had no Progress tab and I do find that useful for motivation."
"I graded more than the amount I graded for assignment 2, but it never said that you finished grading. It just keeps saying fetching next assignment after each grade. How many do you have to grade for the second assignment?"
"I was curious how and when I can submit the third - optional - essay, Will there be another \writing assignment\"" box?"""
"Wow, <redacted> <redacted> sounds like a lovely fellow!"
I think I graded about four essays before it said I had graded enough.
"I noticed that too Jackie but, like you, I'm English and feel 'neech' is how it is pronounced. Saying that I've noticed quite a lot of differences in pronunciation across the whole course and we all know how the Americans try to make English their own what with the spelling differences etc. ;-)"
Agreed.
It took about 2 days for my assignment 2 grade to appear. As it is early in the submission process the number of available reviewers will increase as more work is submitted.
You have to submit your work before the peer review pages are made available to you
Hi there
"Ah, I managed to find a related post. "
Are there similar websites for other fields?
"I have submitted the second essay. today, i received the peer grading. unfortunately it was ( zero, 10, 12). The frustration is that some one was able to give you a zero in five areas,neglecting all your effort with no comment."
"People are suggesting tech support if this is the case- mind you, if it's assignment one the option to review may be closed now, check the deadlines"
Is there a message confirming it was successfully submitted in the assessment panel pages?
"One od my reviewers literally gave me a grade of 1 in my essay; this was in extreme contrast to the other grades I received.....am wondering if grading takes into account that a reviewer may have no knowledge in  an area, hence a poor grade is awarded"
"It is distressing, when one tries and gets an extremely poor grade from one out of four persons."
Thanks for sharing the link!
"You can still submit essays 2 and 3 for peer review! As Micahela points out, it's not impossible to pass the course at this point."
"Yes, there will be a Writing Assignment 3 posted toward the end of the course."
"Nehajain, Christine from Germany, Micahela, Pacoa, EElliott - A thousand thanks for your comments. But there is not a complete happiness, my peers reviewers, of this wonderful course, don_t like that paper and I have obtained only few points in my progress bar. I will see what has happened for correcting it."
I stated before my assignment to the reviewer to please check grades before submitting. 
"The bars for my essays are also grey, I think that's just for colour coding the different components."
"In case someone else comes across this thread, the Final Exam will be worth 20%."
"These suggestions are prompted by a mistake I just made.  I spent a long time editing an essay, had just reread it to make sure I was finished with my comments, and then was called to help someone in the room.  I hit return as I jumped up to help, remembering too late that I had forgotten to score it numerically. I am so sorry -- with the way the system is randomly entering scores the writer could receive any score or it may just throw out my grades and suggested edits."
Quiz 5 marks not updated on progress panel though the submission was on time do reply.
Not that I know of. It will probably be shared towards the end of the course.
"I had a similar experience to that of Dimpy of a paper being rejected where the reviewers comments on misspecified references made me most dejected. This was before the days of PCs, word processors and refence management software. It wqas not the reviewers comments per se but that I realised I had stuffed up.  I thought I had paid close attention to getting the references correct and the effort I put into the paper that I did not resubmit again for publication.  Forty years later, I am in the process of resubmitting the paper.  I wish I had the advice that we all have received in this course from Dr <redacted> way back then.  My carerr may have been different ;>).  Tcsheuss <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
It's simply a screen that lets you see the results of peer review on your work. 
I do hope that staff will take these suggestions along with others posted throughout the forum and consider whether it is possible to implement them
Thank you!
It's the same for Essay 02 mark
"Hi,"
Both are fine on mine - a couple of possibilities spring to mind:
"I am a non-native speaker, and my motto is \When in doubt, consult a dictionary\"". So I consulted \""The Oxford Dictionary of the English Lanuage\"" and found out that both variants are absolutely acceptable. I had never heard \""nitch\"" before the Preofessor used it, I was used to \""neesh\"" - it is obviously a borrowing from French. Yet, who can doubt what the dictionary (and a good one!) says :)?"""
"True, 'open ended problems' sounds as though there are no definite solutions possible. :-)"
Dear Kristin
Final exame - 20%
"'Keep in mind that one of the options for this assignment is to rewrite the introduction section of a previously published manuscript. If a student has chosen this topic, they are expected to have some language that exactly matches the language in the original manuscript. This is a rewriting assignment rather than a writing assignment. Please do not flag this as plagiarism.  (You do not need to look up the original introduction; just grade the student on how well their revised version reads.)'"
"Remember, you are able to resubmit the essay a second time plus there's the third optional essay and the best two scores of three will be used for your final essay score"
"I have scored 4 peer's work, but the system tells I've only done one. Actually, it stoped counting after I finished first scoring. Is there anyone else have the same problem?"
Some people are reporting that selecting the 'I'm unsure..' button seems to make that review not be counted. Are you doing that?
Thanks for your advice on reference software.
"It is common to use the passive voice when writing in Japanese. When writing in English, I automatically find myself using the passive. This course has been really helpful and from now I will freewrite, then go back and check I am actually using the active voice. Hopefully, with time, the active voice will become more natural."
Thank you!
Oh my god..Thank you very much ! I thought it was 'I'm sure...' so I selected it every time!
"HI All, "
Not yet... I've only submitted assignment 1 so far
"No, the median score of the final submission of the essay is the one that will count so you still get 10/15"
thank you
"It was quite deliberate. He even wrote \the assignment should be 300 words minimum\"" in the editing box. "
"For the world writing family it is very important to listen the cathedrals who are published their papers in the most relevant journals around the world. It was for me very interesting to listen the <redacted>, <redacted> (super!), and <redacted> interviews. Many thanks my beautiful and very smart teacher. In a few minutes I have learned a lot. Your questions were precise, focused, concise, clear, and brief and therefore the professionals answers were excellent and a the necessary good complement of this marvelous unforgettable course."
dear sir
I accidentally submitted my last assessment before I had typed some of the comments that I wanted to make.  Is there any way to go back and add them? Thanks!
"Hello,"
"I also saw this: I always read and comment / edit before scoring as I feel I have a better idea of the paper and its merits after this. However, I noticed that when I went back to score some of the boxes had checked themselves randomly. Luckily I was able to change them before submitting. They weren't all at 0 but appeared randomly in all sections."
I do not mind my grading in the essay Number 2.
I don't understand the second homework deadline: Is it on Nov 05 or November 08?
"I didn't include the link.  I hope it is o.k. to post links in this forum.  The link is below.  The man's name is Emir Kamenica.  He ended up going to Harvard College.  Given that Mr. Kamenica feels he got away with it, and the teacher feels Emir didn't plagiarize/deserved to go to private school regardless, I'm not sure if there is a strong moral.  But Prof. Kamenica definitely feels it is plagiarism.  "
"I find the peer asessment lacking extremely. Of the three peer assessments that I have gotten, there was only ONE comment which said [good work] but then gave me three times a score of 1. I would really like to know why this person gave me scores of 1, because then I can improve my work. But in general: come on people, put some effort into the peer grading. I just sucks when you've been working for some time on other people's work and then get back no feedback at all!"
At this point some of us have completed all course materials and assignments except for the final.  Can you let us know what dates the final will be available?
"Hi, even I have the same problem. when i resubmitted it, it's not showing the message, that you have completed your submission; instead it is again showing new submission. Kindly help."
Professor <redacted>:
"I also chose option 3 and it has been flagged, but no explanation as to why."
Thera a final exam that is worth 20% too
"Hi Michaela,"
"My essay was flagged last time.  Curious, I ran it through three free online plagiarism detectors.  Two said it was original, one absolutely trashed it. That one showed me what phrases it was looking for: no wonder it thought I wasn't being original when it searched for phrases like \Review\"", \""We found that\"", the name of the paper's author... it seemed to split phrases blindly on punctuation and search for them.  You may have been nailed by a poor piece of programming like that."
thanks
"If you review the assignment options, you'll see anyone can do option #5, a letter to a newspaper editor on a scientific article."
I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens...
"No, just submit it here. These aren't real documents were producing just exercises."
Unfortunately i missed submitting the first essay ... would i complete the course or there will be a dramatic loss in my score?
I can't even find my peer feedback???
"Details for the third essay, along with the submission link, will be up soon!"
You may find Prof. <redacted>'s post on the forum useful:
"Hello,"
"The system is set up so that it sets your final score to the middle score from your 3 peers (and not the average score). In this case, the middle score is 11!"
Thank you.
Yes indeed! Here's what Prof. <redacted> posted on the forum recently:
"Yes, you will be able to access the course videos and slides after the course ends!"
But was any submission on October 29th accepted for grading purposes.  
"If you submitted your essay, it's in the queue, and will be graded by your peers soon. You will be able to access your feedback as soon as the required number of peer graders have reviewed your submission!"
"Submit button on essay 2 learn to grade is STILL not working, even on Google Chrome."
All this is clearly stated in the week six slides.
Option 5 - Letter to the Editor re science article should work well for you.
Just a few seconds after submitting assignment 2 I got a notification in the assessment panel: Status= Finished. Grader type: Automatic checker.Any body knows what this is?. I checked my essay and every thing was scored as zero although it is complete and not flagged. I started peer grading and a message showed up telling I had done the required grading despite the fact that I had done only one grading.
"Same here.  Once again I received a useless peer review-- no comments, no score, and all zeroes.  It's severely discouraging to try this kind of assignment with such lazy graders.  It's not particularly fair."
"Dear instructor, "
"Thank you friends, for the great peer reviews once again. There have been some excellent comments in both essays, so far."
"Thanks a lot! I managed to find it without the actual link, simply by typing \Thisamericanlife\"" and using key words. Thanks for the second link!"""
Thank you Sheila. I'm stunned that PLoS One has an editor and peer reviewers. The paper by Schlaudecker is not the first paper from PLoS One that I have found lacking in style or substance. I stand by my opinion that it is amazing what gets published when you pay.
"Invalid problem id specified: i4x://Medicine/SciWrite/combinedopenended/69f<zipRedac>7656c76<zipRedac>4ca<zipRedac>a15d1<zipRedac>ce1a4fe2bb . Have you made any submissions for that problem? If you haven't, please try making one."
"\Trolls\"" being the operative word here..."""
"Purposefully low (random or all zero) scores can be screened out by the system, IF there are only very few reviewers who do the Troll routine (i.e. mark arbitrarily or just give out zeros, without editing or commenting). However, when too many reviewers act this way, then trollish reviews pile up and overpower everything else. If in the beginning there had been one bad apple in the bunch, now it has spread to many more... And this has seriously undermined the peer review system."
thank you so much
"The score is the median of the three results so 0, 11 and 15 gives 11 as does 10,11 and 15"
"Completely agree. The essay is not to receive offensive comments ( this is your first, first draft); and not precisely well evaluated, because the \peer\"" doesn_t know the field. The evaluation is only to analyze the quality of the essay, not the study design."""
"I recommend taking a look at this *The New York Times* blog, http://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/, as it's about accurate and stylish writing."
How did you get A in your writing assignments so far? Mine are all B's. I am wondering if we can post any of our previous writing assignments so we can see how to improve our scores.
"Good point. I really want to see more time for Essays next time, so students get plenty of time for commenting and exchanging ideas and review practices. What is a good writing so far who score A's? Mine are so far B's."
Does it mean that nobody reviewed it? What to do now? When I get my grade?
I submitted essay 2 yesterday 11-4-13; I did not yet peer grad others- none and I got score rubric from grader 1
I submitted essay 2 yesterday 11-4-13; I did not yet peer grad others- none and I got score rubric from grader 1
I copied your essay into Word and got 311 words. I think you are good to go!
"It does not matter. There is no lower limit, only upper limit."
"Don't worry, You still have two more assays and a handful of quiz. Hope you will do well in those sections to get the minimum score expected. All the best."
I think it is impossible to evaluate whether peer review works until #3 is fixed.
"I Feel that the two first graders of my essay might have inadvertently graded as 0 the first rubric \Clarity\"". It makes no sense considering the other rubric grades. Is it possible to revise this?"
"sorry, but i am totally not happy with the reviews."
"Yes, well that's true for me too - I submitted the 2nd assignment 4 days ago, and still no feedback. Practically no feedback on the 1st assignment either."
" I know I'm a bit late on the post, but I'd love to team up with someone for the resubmit of essay 2. I'm a PhD in microbiology and genomics. <emailRedac> "
Once you grade 4 you should get a confirmation message with the option to continue grading. However some people have reported that selecting the 'I'm unsure about this score' box results in that grading not being counted
"In all the assess I have the best notes, but, there was a person that gave me 0 in all of the criteria, I think that people if not like read, not should evaluate the essays. I dont agree with this manner of assess."
I was graded for my second essay before i could re submit my essay and get use of the peers' review. This is unfair.
You need to grade 4 before you can see the reviews of your work.
It depends on journal. 
I did four more reviews but did not receive any feedback for my resubmitted one and is still the same.
"I have submitted my second essay, but get the following message on the peer grading page:"
I am receiving the same error after submitting assignment 2. And I have completed all the quizzes. Is the peer reviewing system down again?
I just emailed tech support and will update here if get a fix.
"In case it helps, here is the specific page link regarding submitting to more than one journal on overlapping publication: http://www.icmje.org/publishing_d.html"
I'm getting an error message as well.
"Hi I already evaluated about 5 essays but whenever i have more comments in the evaluations it tells me an error occur, as a consequence the system says i have only evaluated 2. Please help"

I have just completed two thorough peer assessments (about 20 minutes each) and when I submitted them I received an error message. I accepted the first might have been an isolated issue but both of them! I'm feeling really frustrated because as a solo parent working full time it is very difficult to make time for my course work and then it is lost by the system.
but you can feel it
Hello 
The grading system is questionable !!!
"For assignment 2,I have put the following paragraph at the top of my submitted assignment."
thanks :)
Thanks :)
"No reply from tech support, but it appears to be working this morning - the error message has now been replaced with a \learning to grade\"" section."
help!
"Colafanta, it takes much longer than an hour for receiving the peer reviews. You might be looking at the scores of the first submission. Note that the scores are erased only AFTER all the three reviews of the second submission are complete."
"In my case, the average time for receiving peer reviews has been about 24 hours or so."
"Ha ha! Good one, Lorraine."
I submitted my essay 2 yesterday but it is still doesn't appear on the assessment panel. Morevover I cannot proceed with the peer grading sice I get this error message 
This happened to me too. It's so annoying when I have thoroughly graded 2 people (with very useful feedback for them) and all of that seemed to be accidentally deleted as soon as I clicked the submit button.
"the answer is D \all of the above\"""""

Last time 3 out of the 6 peer reviews (incl. resubmission) I received just gave seemingly random marks (all over the place) without a single comment. This time, it's worse. I received 3 out of 3 peer reviews that not only completely disagree with each other but also do not contain a single comment/sentence/suggestion for improvement."
"I just looked at my progress and saw that my grade so far consists of three components: Homework, quizzes and writing assignments. However if I add up the maximum sizes of all three bars in the final grade, I just get a maximum total of (10% + 20% + 50% =) 80%. Is there another thing involved that isn't included yet or is this an error?"
"hi,"
There's a final exam worth 20%
Hi Micahela and OliK79!
I only know that it's going to appear later in the schedule Vic - it is mentioned in the course syllabus material
"hey, thanks for your reply."
or here: https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Medicine/SciWrite/Fall2013/discussion/forum/i4x-Medicine-SciWrite-course-Fall2013-course-materials/threads/<zipRedac>27948ef381aee<phoneRedac>
"My point was simply that, by taking the median, you eliminate any effect that outliers have. It doesn't necessarily mean you end up with the 'right' score but, even though we all had to 'train' before starting to grade, this type of assessment is unlikely to be perfect. "
What are you classing as an A? I got 13 in my first assignment on the first try. Not done the second one yet.
"This is way out of hand. My re-edited essay, after having incorporated all the \requests\"" of the first reviewers, scored lower than my first draft. The funny thing is that there was quite the disagreement between the three reviewers, making the issued grades as study in random dynamics."
"Hi,"
"Dear technique support staff,"
You might want to check out my thread on this:
I got 12
Are you talking about this course? It's not over yet.
"Hi,"
"There is an assignment 3 tab, but no assignment listed."
"I strongly suspect that some people have mistaken this grading system with the Facebook \like\"" system: if they don't like a topic or a choice of words (regardless of the rules given in the course - it's happened to me quite a few times) then they butcher it grade-wise. Every time I grade, I also re-read the description of each grading area (to remember what a 2 means under style, for example). Others might have more \""liberal\"" views..."""
Thank you very much Dr. <redacted> <redacted> and everyone at Stanford who worked to make this course a success. 
I think Assignment 3 was dropped from the beginning as you can see in the progess bars. 
Maybe this thread can collect all such comments and suggestions.
"That is a much more sensitive matter, and probably even more prevalent, it would be nice to cover it more than the obvious writing plagiarism."
The third assignment is optional- I believe it will be an opportunity to further revise either assignment 1 or 2. The lowest essay value will then be dropped and the final essay score will be derived from the two highest. As with the final exam I think they will open next week - at least that's what the syllabus suggests
"Here are a few links I keep bookmarked for writing and editing assistance, in case they can help anyone. "
I was using chrome and had to switch to IE to get everything to work right
"Submit it as a \New Submission\"""""
Unfortunately I tried a new submission minutes ago and the same happened again: automatic checker. In my first assignment I had a problem of incomplete submission twice and that turned out to be a technical problem as said in the staff reply. What is the chance of one student to have technical issues affecting 50% of the course grade??? This course is great but these technical issues are a very big concern.
"Hi,"
"I got a decent score for my second essay, but have time to resubmit for a second grading."
Thank you for the links!
"It is purely a guess but with over 4100 Essay 1's, I hardly think any suggested improvement requires just \a little bit of extra work\""..."""
"Well, it's guesswork from my part too, but I think more openness, like Sudarshan suggests, a non-anonymous peer review process, plus the option to flag the review, would make everyone (not just the reviewers), more responsible."
Angelos_Pet (below) has some very good suggestions addressing that.
"\Learning\"" is the operative word here. What if Learning became real by operating the Peer Review process as a Machine Learning experiment?"""
"Hi there,"
I assume essays are randomly assigned but the initial reviewers will probably have completed their gradings by now so won't be in the pool of graders (unless they have also re-submitted their work) making it very unlikely it will be seen by the same people again.
"This post is mainly directed to the organizers, but since I'm not sure about how can I contact them and other students may have experienced the same, I'm posting it in the general discussion forum."
"This topic has been widely discussed here - it is a technical glitch, not someone's malicious intentions. After a peer comments on an assignment, the first three scores become \0\"" and the peer has to go back to correct them. There is no need to report such cases. Are you sure you checked the grades you gave before hitting \""Submit\""? If you didn't, then the grades you gave might have also turned to zeros."""
"This is my sincere request to the course staff, kindly address this issue. its causing a major chaos (this is a peer grading course not automatic checker)!!"
My friend is facing same problem please help and the deadline is approaching.
Thank you very much for sharing these resources. I visited them and they are definitely very useful.
"I really appreciate the scoring and modification made by the peers,which will improve my writing."
"Hello,"
"I've been getting the same message for the last 2 days. I've emailed tech support twice, but its still the same."
"Although its a couple of weeks away I'd like to express my thanks before the course closes. I have thoroughly enjoyed the course and find that my writing style has changed substantially - hopefully I'll continue to remember the tips and not drift back into my 'clutter-ful' ways. Unfortunately, this means I am now spending time reviewing many of my work documents :)"
"hey I resubmitted too, after 1 day I still got back the same scores and comments from the previous graders! Can anyone address this? I spent my time re-editing and  there was just no difference shown in the page!"
My essay is flagged still! This is introduction from my published paper. What I can do?
I am really sorry to bother you but I do really not understand something:
I am really sorry to bother you but I do really not understand something:
Same here
dear sir i submit my essay no.2 since long time before peer grading opened at 1st November with no response up till now. waiting your kind response
"I think the writing assignments were a great for the sake of practice! However, peer grading for an introduction to a scientific paper is probably not appropriate. In the case of specialized studies, the reader (peer grader) probably has \no clue\"" understanding the paper's meaning. Also, as it was mentioned in the lectures _writers should go easy on acronyms. "
my question is if journal response is to make some revisions and then resubmit the paper.
"It happened this time again when I was grading the 2nd essay. Good thing, I caught it before I pressed the \submit button.\"""""
"As someone else already explained above in geat detail, taking the median you do *not* eliminate the effect of outliers if they are non-random, as the 0-point assignments often are in this course."
"That's true... but who knows, maybe they reward to the chosen person with trip to somewhere.... :)"
I agree with you.  Like the optimal solution in area of mathematics.
The challenge is to make the introduction section understandable beyond your own field!
It will be posted on Friday. This assignment is an optional revision.
Thanks for compiling these links! Here's another someone just sent me:
"I graded 6 essays, and 3 of them didn't follow the suggested format in the video by Prof. <redacted>. (i.e., Known->Unknown/Gaps/Limitations->Hypothesis/Problem/Question with hints of the Methodology). The suggested format makes a lot of sense, as it really produces a clearer, succinct, and more organized writing.) It dawned on me that maybe there are more peers who did not heed the message of the \Introduction\"" video. I can say this because one of my reviewers suggested that I move one of the sentences in the Known section to the END of the essay. I felt irritated because I worked hard to revise a paper full of clutter into a more streamlined one, only to be advised to reorganize it. Good thing, her/his grade of 11 didn't matter in my final grade. (The other two grades are 15 and 13.) I hope those who are editing/reviewing  an \""Introduction\"" essay would watch the video intently and remember its message as they grade other essays."""
Kristin replied to one of the posts that the final exam will be released on Friday Nov 15. There will be 21 multiple choice questions. She said it would be easy. :)
Final exam will be posted a week from Friday. It's a short multiple choice exam.
Assignment 3 (optional revision) will be posted on Friday.
Thanks for the suggestions. We will be incorporating some of these into the next iteration of the course.
"There is an issue with my essay, so I hope someone will help. "
"If people are unable to do any editing because they think it is good, they can still write a comment afterwards saying that they really liked the essay. When I am doing editing, I do as much as a I can with the time I have, and then give further comments afterwards."

"My experience is pretty good in the peer review process both technically and actual work-wise. I found the system is robust enough. The peers are so caring in their review process and comments. Each time, 8 reviewers reviewed my essays. I got very good grade with constructive feedback. At the first submission of my essay 2, someone (don't know who s/he was) highly praised my writing and the topic. I feel so good about it. Thank you all for your time and comments. It¡¯s inspiring."
"For the second writing assignment, one of the graders has skipped grading my essay on one aspect, as a result of which I ended up re-submitting the essay with a few changes. I also had to peer review 4 more essays (in total 8). Upon grading these 4 new essays, I did not receive my new grades/comments. The assessment panel directed me to the same old reviews and hence grades. There is no change in the peer comments at all. Could you please fix this so that I can view my new grades and comments, if at all the 2nd time submitted essay was re-graded by 3 other peers? "
Probably not a good idea as you are likely to go over the word count and some reported text being cut off in assignment 1 if their work was longer than 600 words
"I wanted to submit writing assignment 2 but unfortunately, I couldn't get into the Courseware. Everytime I want to view the site I see information that page is not found. Because of this I can't upload my work. "
Dear staff! I submitted my esse and received all 0 from automatic checker. I resubmitted it - and again the same problem. Now I cannot resubmit it becouse I used 2 attempts. How can I improve this situation and what does it mean?
"In my second submission a word (\some\"") was deleted and immediately replaced with the very same word (\""some\"").  The review was arrogant in tone, with numerous misspellings of simple words and seemed rushed in that the grader did not take two seconds to understand a simple non-scientific comparison in a totally non-scientific submission.  My score was relatively low (8/15) and I may have deserved it, but even a probably accurate review can lose credibility because of the above factors."""
"I wrote a short \to my peer reviewers\"" before my essay this time, to encourage whoever reviews mine to comment sth, and hope they will do this time...  Anything would do, at least it shows they care."
Hi Dr <redacted>
Same issue here. Where did this automatic grader come from?
I also have the same problem for two days.
"No the median is the middle score when they are placed in order so 11,14,15 gives a median of 14"
"Oops, I stand corrected. Thanks for pointing it out. The median in my case is 14. "
Hi there :)
I have the same problem
"I have the same. My first essay got rejected. Second too. So I have no points at all from this part of the course. I was in contact with technical staff and got information that it might be due to spelling or grammar errors, which is not enough of explanation for me, as I read many peer work with errors and they somehow went through the system. I am very frustrated."
"thx for comments, but I honestly gave grader benefit of the doubt (which s/he didn't do for me) but the sloppiness of the many other edits suggest the sloppiness of even accidentally erasing \some\"" and replacing it with same.  I can understand/forgive differences in American vs British English, but I was referring to clear-cut misspellings in either/any English likely due to a careless haste to get the obligation done with."""
"Hello everyone,"
"Twice I have seen an issue where I couldn't submit my critique of an essay.  Everything is filled in, but the \Submit\"" button is ghosted out and can't be clicked."
"I had the same issue.  If you have the data filled in completely, try entering the box where you edit the essay and hit CTRL-ENTER.  This submitted mine when the SUBMIT button was ghosted out."
"I submitted my 2nd essay before Friday 1st, but until now nobody graded me. I did not got any notes so far and had no chance to improve my essay... and in a few hours the time will run out and I cant submit an improved version. Thats quite unfair because I did my work so early...!"
"Maybe dropping the lowest peer review would help level the playing field here. I fully intended to get a \Distinction\"" grade in this amazing class, but with papers being 50% of the grade, you could actually fail the course due to apathetic peer reviewers \""help\""."""
The peer grading is highly biassed...
"I had the same problem-could not undo a deletion. When this happened I added a comment explaining, and said please consider the text not changed."
"Dear fellow students,"
One more!
Good idea Xiaoheng. I've had two reviews with no comments and a low score (one for each essay). Luckily for me it seems I got off lightly - the other reviewers spent time on their job and made mostly useful comments.
Thank you Doctor <redacted> for posting this link!
"Once more BeatriceM, thank you!"
"I resubmitted my second writing assignment and did a new round of peer edits, but the \new\"" results I received on my second attempt were actually the same results I received on my first attempt. They weren't just the same scores, they were the same comments (or lack of comments, you dirty, dirty slackers) as well. I don't know who to email my complaints to, so I'm posting here. Somebody help me please!"""
"If I got some score from first submission, can reviews from second submission lower final score or not?"
"When grading the second essay, I noticed that after I edit the student's essay, the numerical assessments I gave changed.  There still may be a software problem."
Thank you Professor <redacted>!
"I had the same problem of not being able to undo an accidental deletion, without reseting the whole review, which I wasn't about to do after a huge amount of work. I made a comment beside it/them that said [Ignore the previous deletion, it was my typing error and I couldn't undo it.]"
Hi Maneka!
Melodrama! It's not the end of the world.
"I have recieved many unhelpful peer reviews. On my first try on writing assignment two, only one review gave me any form of help. I changed my essay, resubmitted it, and I got one higher score,and two that were really bad. I was wondering if I could get my essay reevaluated."
"Hey Emarston,"
"Hey Silvia,"
Hello!
Dr. Efron truly understands good writing. Thank you for sharing these tips. I enjoyed your interview. 
"Hi,"
me too have the same problem.
"Hi,"
Your final score will be based on the ones you receive on your second submission!
"Your essay will receive the middle score from your 3 peer reviewers. The lowest score will not be counted. Thus, if you received an unfair peer review (such as getting all zeros), this will not be counted."
"If you submitted your essay, it's in the queue, and will be graded by your peers soon. You will be able to access your feedback as soon as the required number of peer graders have reviewed your submission!"
"If you submitted your essay, it's in the queue, and will be graded by your peers soon. You will be able to access your feedback as soon as the required number of peer graders have reviewed your submission!"

"If you submitted your essay, it's in the queue, and will be graded by your peers soon. You will be able to access your feedback as soon as the required number of peer graders have reviewed your submission!"
"Yes, peer grading is mandatory!"
"Dear colleagues, I just submitted my second essay, but I forgot to put the references. Before anyone understand that this is a plagiarism, following my reference (I rewrote an introduction: Option 2):"
Your submission should appear unflagged now!
I just got the email and now I can grade. Thanks for fixing the problem!
I hit the submit button before pasting my own work... is there anything I can do to send my work?
"Hallo,"
If i submit the assignment for the second time and get grade less than what i got in first time submission which grade you will count for the final grading? is the second submission grade or the highest grade that i get in two submissions?
Thank you!
I have the same problem. I resubmitted and received the same scores and comments. I emailed them about this. Would you please let us know whether we have to grade again (if you find out)?
"I don't think this info is useful in this case. This is about people not putting any efforts in grading their peers, nothing to do with having any technical errors."
"Agree. Here the \norm\"" is the lower outlier, and that too due to system defects. It makes more sense to drop the lowest score. The top scores also seem to have more descriptive comments, indicative of a sincere review process. So why toss them out?"""
Great! Thanks fot the hint!
same problem. I emailed tech support too...hopefully they'll get back to me.
> Maybe we should be required to Review first and then post our submissions...
"Elsewhere in the forums, people have mentioned that checking the box \I am unsure about the scores I have given above\"" may cause this problem."""
"hey, i have the same problem. can you please tell me, how to email them?"
There is no bar for final exam at the moment? Have we been intimated about it yet?
I again have a problem with the message of my essay!
It is mentioned in the course syllabus and Prof <redacted> has posted about it recently indicating it is a 21 question multiple choice paper that will appear on the 15th
I wrote an e-mail to the technical support and they fixed the problem!
"Rajhansa, it has happened even when the scores were assigned. Happens even in Chrome. A quick hack is to toggle the scores for a while, and this seems to enable the button."
I agree with Emmalgale about giving written positive feedback but was hoping to get away from the problem of low scores and no editing that so many report. If there is some type of automated check in place a check box with a high score could give a 'pass' if no/minimal editing is present.
Are you checking the 'I'm unsure about this score' box? Some people have reported that reviews with this checked don't get counted in the total submitted.
Thank you for clarification.
I have a question here about the final exam? Does anyone know what is the final exam about and when it is going to be open? Thank you.
"Great work, keep it up! :-)"
"Hi, I submitted the home work 1, but the progress bar does not display it."
techsupport@class.stanford.edu
me neither. I did omit them intentionally.
In your second set of point I'd reverse your rule of thumb in point 1 and suggest that it is better to edit before grading or at least ensure that a check on the applied scores is performed after you edit
URGENTLY to STAFF
not for every one but after completing the required number of peer grading.
"I agree, it is not possible in 300-500 words to explain everything for everyone. I am also very put off by the grading by vandals. I got really good marks and useful edits from some and then really low grades with no editing and the only comment: \I don't understand the content\""? Perhaps more \""editing\"" should be set as homework and these could be marked automatically dependent on the grader's agreement with the lecturer's assessment."""
"Dear Lecturers and Peers,"
"Thanks! That's ok now! The problem was in cheking the \score\"" box. But I still cannot resubmit my essay. It was graded by 3 students, may be it's not enough? Should I wait any more or resubmit without improving it?"""
3 is the right number - there are a number of posts about the New submission button not working but I don't know the answer - some suggest a change of browser
Have you reviewed other essays?
"I've lost my rag doing my second round of peer reviewing. I have almost finished editing 3 reviews this afternoon, all of which I have been navigated away from by pressing the delete button AGAIN. I have wasted an hour of my time editing peoples' reviews only to have my work lost. You can keep my second submission score, I'm not wasting any more of my time peer reviewing only for your system to lose my work."
I agree. I can't score an essay until I have finished the edit.
I just submitted mine and completely forgot to put in which paper I was adapting. Hopefully that won't be a problem either.
"I lost one of my reviews when I hit the \submit\"" button. I do not know what was wrong with the system. It had lenghty comments. Too bad that the system fetched a different essay. However, I did two edits afterwards. I learned a lot from doing so. In the end I have done 4, plus the failed one. Maybe I do some more this weekend."
"Hello, "
"It is possible, it just takes a lot longer."
"Hi all,"
It is not possible until the feedback is received. By now seems like nobody has reviewed my essay yet. This is really strange.
"Starting, today, I am no longer able to play the course videos. When I push the \play\"" button, it goes to the first frame (the white screen) and it stops there with the loading round control in the middle of the screen. The problem seems to appear in any video (I randomly tried 5-8 videos), from this course. Before this appeared I changed the speed of a videos, by I don't think this caused the problem. "
Explained here:
"I also got a score without any comments, this is really not helpful."
I cannot figure out how to submit Writing Assignment 3. Does anyone know how?
"Hello,"
"I have the very same problem. I suppose you as well have the notification under 'Writing Assignment 2' section like this: \Your response has been submitted. Please check back later for your grade.\"""
I suggest you contact technical support using the link at the bottom of the page. Good luck!
Where is it?..
"hi there. i am facing the same problem as well. I resubmitted, but the page showed the same thing- same comments, same grades! Even after I had already edited 8 more essays! I waited for 2 days, it is still the same. My score did not get improved, and no further comments too. "
"I am aware of this, and I'm really enjoying editing other peoples' writing, but having almost finished 3 comprehensive edits and having them just be lost into the aether is so frustrating. I don't blame anyone who just gives scores with no editing for this reason!"
"Im having the same problem: I submitted my essay n_2 a few hours ago (I know I was late). As expected nobody grade it yet, buy it is almost the deadline time and I cannot submit my final version. Any help?"
your comment is very helpful
"OMG, wish I am the only one just noticed where quiz is, maybe because I use Mac... , anyhow, video is on the left of commend bar, and the quiz is on the right. :-) You all have a nice weekend!"
"I have a similar problems. I have graded about six essays but each time the response I get is that \you have submitted one peer review\"". I cannot review my own essay. What do I do?"""
"I am <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, a member of the tech team."
"I just noticed that in the submitted assignment I wrote the title of the paper referenced incorrectly (it is missing a word), and I forgot to mention the authors as well. "
Thanks for the link. I thought it was the mean and not the median of the three scores. Now everything is clear.
Writing Assignment 2 Finished Automatic Checker
"I have received the grade for my essay, but unfortunately there was no editing remarks. It is not useful to me. Please, do not leave essays without editor's remarks, except the perfect essays. I got 10 points out of 15, so I expected the peer reviewer did not like everything."
"No, it's viewed as a independent piece"

I was unhappy with my introduction peer feedback and resubmitted the same essay - as I was happy with what I had submitted - and was looking for more constructive feedback. I did this without making any alterations.

I did something similar: I capitalised but no full stop first time then dropped the capital and still got it wrong.
"I truly believed and actually submitted more than 4 peer evaluations. However, the system only shows that I have submitted only 1. Even before the recent ones were submitted today, several peer evaluations were also submitted. Due to this glitch or error on the server side, I will cease to continue any more peer evaluations. It would be great to have this fixed because I would like to see my feedback. Does this have anything to do with checking the box that mentions that what you submitted was, \UNSURE?\"""""
"I had the same experience with an inconsistently low mark with no editing feedback, and was very angry as well.  Apparently there are a lot of people doing this.  I guess that's what you get with a free course... You'd think people drawn to this great learning opportunity would have more integrity."
"Yes, it looks this is the problem. Every time you put a tick in the box \Unsure\"", the system does not recognize the essay as truly reviewed. :("""
"I had given mostly 3's in an essay I just graded and after doing the in-depth change part, I clicked on submit - while it was in process of submitting it went back and I saw that zeros were checked - I had not checked any zeros - I know you indicated there was a problem with some zero defaults - this is unfortunate as the student didn't deserve any zero's - hopefully those essays that got zeros will be fixed somehow."
I have finished four. Where can I find that how many I've finished?
There is a message appears telling you how many have completed - I think it's above where the peer essays appear
"The staff response is confusing as they say middle but mean the middle score when the 3 are placed in ascending order (ie. the median) rather than the score from the second grader. It would be better, in my opinion, if they used the term median with a brief explanation as there are many people confused by this."
"This is ridiculous,sorry. But I just saw the provision for assignment 3 , which said one could submit either a revised version of our essay 1 or 2 . I revised my essay 2 since I to had like many others the automatic checker grading my essay 2 in both submissions."
"Also it said we are required to do 4 more peer reviews if we wish to participate , by submitting an essay for writing assignment 3. When u click on writing assignment 3 after unit 8 ,there is no tab saying writing assignment 3peer grading. Where n hoe do I do that? "
"I assume that the \word limit\"" of 500 still applies, since Writing Assignment (WA) 3 is a rewrite of Essays 1 or 2."
"If you submitted the same essay twice, it's probably not that surprising that you got the same feedback on both attempts."
Thanks for letting us know about these issues so that we can improve the user interface for the future.
You will be able to submit Essay 3 (a revision of Essay 1 or 2) after you complete module 8 (I think - maybe after you start module 8). 
"I think the grading system described at the beginning means that your low score will be dropped. I can't remember if the middle score only is used or not, but the low score is dropped so you would have 15/15 either way."
"I had the same problem with the first peer reviews I completed; I don't know why. It was discouraging, but additional practice editing essays was educational. My second set of four peer reviews was acknowledged. "
Hopefully the peer reviewers for Essay 3 will put in more effort.
"please , I can't get that \Submit a revision of either essay 1 or essay 2, based on your peer feedback\""."
"Hello Kristin,"
"please , I can't get that \Submit a revision of either essay 1 or essay 2, based on your peer feedback\"". I don't know what to write ."""
It is the middle score between  the lower and higher scores.
"I agree with Maneka, I had this problem with Essay 1. I revised and resubmitted, but the same reviewer comments kept appearing after the assessment panel showed that there were new grades. It is obviously still the grades & comments from the 1st submission because my 1st (unrevised) submission still shows up in the reviewer's comment box, even though the revised version appears at the top of the page, so I know it was successfully submitted."
I totally agree! thanks so much for the insights you provided on writing and reviewing manuscripts!
"While we are at it, can we do something about the bug that screws up on the peer review counts? Some of us have schedules and don't have the time to compensate for buggy software."
"Same thing happened with me. Wish there was a way I could go back and fix this, the student deserved more than all zeros!"
You won't receive an evaluation of your essay.
"Hello, thanks for the feedback. I mean, 297 instead of 300 is being petty. However, 1500 rather than a max of 500 or 167 rather than a min of 300 make a big difference."
How to know that the essay is banned?

Prof <redacted> has pinned a post about the automatic checker at top of the board
"The impression one gets from reading the many (too many) repetitive posts here is that everything is amiss--peer grading, honesty in writing (plagiarism), software glitches, etc.  Few post that everything went well.  I will do that. After reading the chicken little posts I feared submitting essay 1 because of the potential for getting zero's even if unintended.  Nonetheless, I did--I had to. I use Chrome and everything went as staff planned.  All my quizzes, lectures, homework, essays, grading were accepted with no problem whatsoever.  There was nothing at all that went awry.  I'm not saying I'm pleased with my grades but that is not the fault of the staff and it does not relate to any software issue.  Sure, the overall course could be improved in plenty of ways, but the bottom line is the present system works and I think I have the agreement of the silent majority who did not bombard this board with annoying complaints.  BTW if all goes well, I calculate I will miss the distinction level by 0.7%--any chance of rounding up?  Excellent course no matter what!"
I have a problem with the 2nd essay. Mine definitely wasn't regraded - as it is the same three reviewers and their original - not so constructive -comments. Since I have regraded extra papers surely my second submission should have been remarked?
"No, I have never used it."
"I totally agree, my experience has been positive and I've learned lots of hints to improve my writing"
neither for me...
Thanks.
"Agree 100%! If there were any problems, they were not the fault of the staff. About the distinction level - I have a similar problem, but I need 2%. So, I thought I would do Writing Assignment 3 - it may improve the situation."
"I begin to do another four peer reviews to see what will happen. After I do the second one, a brief message flashes up to the effect that I have done the required number, then disappears and I am presented with yet another peer review."
"The average shown includes all elements. As the Exam (which is 20% of the final mark) is currently zero--since you haven't done it yet--the overall score will reflect this. For example, if you had scored 100% on all the assessed work to date then your overall score would be 80% on the Progress tab."
"As we all agree, some comments and graders (peer graders) were worthy _others useless. The obvious question is: How can a mooc that is absolutely free _not have peer grading? I don't think there could be, unless a staff of voluntary professors were willing to grade 4100 papers! That is probably not likely. Perhaps an optional payment to cover the time and effort of a qualified instructor could resolve the issue. "
but it shows you have a second chance for submitting the essays:(
One of my markers gave me feedback in Polish and gave me very low scores. Another marker commented that they understood everything very well (no other edits at all) and has marked me 1/3 on clarity. This has brought my average grade down to 69 when I was heading towards a distinction before. Obviously something went wrong here. Is there any way of contesting this?
If you submit for assignment 3 the lowest of the three essay scores is dropped
thanks for asking that question. I was wondering about the same thing and wait for some more essays to be submitted.
"Sorry for you, isamilla, the rating system is totally broken."
That's what I've been doing! Hope I can have such reviewers
"Same with me, and the reviewer seems to be very careful when editing."
"Hello,"
"No, it's only the exam that is on the 15th, the essay is today."
thanks maam

"Agree. Totally broken. I receive even lowers scores when I've improved my essay and made a 2nd submission. There's a system bug with all zeros, and another \2-in-every-category-without-comment\"" grading....Disappointed and upset."""
I believe so.
I have a suggestion for reducing the problem of poor quality reviews in future courses - a review verification system.
"I have something similar, although I sent the final submission, after doing 4 peer  revision I got the same corrections."
"That's an interesting idea and great in principle. The main problem I can forsee is there will be candidates who, no matter what the reviewer has said, will feel it is unfair and their work is better than the given score so will not check the box and will send it back to be marked again and again. I'm also not sure how the time delays this could potentially introduce would affect the running of a time-limited course like this."
"I have noticed that grader 1 assigned me score 0 for clarity (and score 2 or 3 for other areas) and grader 3 assigned me score 0 for clarity, concision, and style(while scored 3 the remaining two areas): I think these score 0 were not assigned on purpose and wonder if they can be revised as they significantly affect the overall score assigned to my essay. Thanks"
"Sorry but I don't agree, there are plenty of courses available that you have to pay for- if you want a dedicated tutor with personal feedback then that's where you need to be looking. It is not practical to employ someone to look after this course (or even all of them) for a number of reasons: they couldn't possibly review all the work, what happens if there weren't enough paying participants to cover their salary etc etc. The whole idea of these free-online moocs is to offer learning opportunities to the masses at no cost and the institutions that offer them are happy to do so as, I guess, much of the material is taken from modules from full time courses so can be generated at little additional cost."
"My apologies, I hadn't been checking, sorry if I caused confusion"
Me too
"Dear all,"
Thanks/
"MOOCS are not built to make a profit-they are built to educate as many people as possible for little cost to the educators. As this educational system is in the toddler stage (I think it is beyond infancy) there will still be bugs in the computer systems, as well as in the individual programs. I find the range of participants is similar to the people in life-some are valuable and very helpful, some are not. And so, as in life, I will accept the help and benefit of those who provide it, and will not pay so much attention to those who offer little or no contribution. "
"Hi everybody,"
One more suggestion: system may be completed by feedback informations for reviewers. At the moment we dont know whether our review is comparable with suggestions other readers. This extra tool may help to improve this stage of writing process.

i don't understand what to do in essay 3?
Thanks!
"PualJM, your comment makes me envy of your experience in writing! How do I make my peer grading: Firstly, I read the text and try to understand it, its structure and main idea. Then, I put my \first-draft\"" scores. Then, I write my main general comments about the structure, organization, ... and give my suggestions how to improve the essay. Then (sorry for repeating), I go along with the text from the beginning to the end and make my specific comments and/or edit/re-write text on my own. Then, at least, I come back to my scores and revise them, if my first impression of the text was wrong. But for me as a non-English native person, editing/revision takes much more time (and effort), than grading."""
"Same here. I submitted assignment 3 about 12 hours age. The gold exclamation point came up next to the Assessment Panel label, but I still do not have access to peer reviews (as in previous assignments)."
 I would be interested also <emailRedac> 
"professor plz, i don't understand what to do with essay 3."
Yes.
"For me, the best experience is someone else could give comments in detail. Just grading wasn't that much for helping improve the writing skill."
Hi everyone.
It does pay to try to think outside the conventional square a little bit.
I do not think it is helpful if someone did peer grade with 1 for any five criteria without giving any editing and revision in the writing assignment. 
I haven't gotten a reply either.
Great idea Mohamed!
"It happened to me too. The reviewer commented \[Excellent :)]\"" in my essay but he/she graded my essay's clarity, concision, and style zeros. He/she gave my organization and focus 3s though. I believe these zeros are not intended--the same error happened."
"Peer review works iff the reviewer understands the content of the essay. Merely scrutinizing the essay from a syntactic point of view leads to erronous reviews. In my case the reviewed essay, after a whole lot of paragraph level editing by a certain reviewer, does not make any technical sense at all!"
"I hope so, too. My weekend finishes in 9 hours : )"
"You only get access to your grade once you have finished reviewing and your essay has been reviewed the required number of times. If you don't have access yet, your essay is probably still in the process of being reviewed."
I have the same problem. At first I thought that I got confused between the training papers and actual papers. But later I realized that it's a glitch in the system.
"Lol, do you think those people are here in the discussion forum?"
Have you completed 4 peer reviews? Your marks aren't made available until you do this
"Or even a pop up when you press submit saying 'you have given a score of x, is this what you intended?'"
I think that edits also should be scored and included as a part of the final grade.
That's a good idea
"I checked course progress and found the total possible score is 80 points (10 points for quiz, 20 points for homework, and 50 points for essay). Since writing assignment 3 is optional, 80 points is the highest score one can reach. Then it becomes mission impossible for anyone to score 90 points or higher. Please explain. "
"Did this course help improve writing in the sciences in just a few weeks? Absolutely! Wonderful course, great teacher, patient staff and helpful course mates in the forum! Thank you all! Thank you Stanford."
what will the final exam include?
"Hi folks, I am sure this concern has been raised before: peer reviewers giving scores without a single edit. For instance I got 2's across the board by a reviewer but the essay had not been edited at all, so I have clue no where it was awkward and boring; where it was full of clutter; where the disorganization lay, etc...you get the drift. Smacks of laziness, methinks. "
Hi 
I totally agree with that - the reviewer should always make edits and justify their grading. 
"Good course, useful tricks and course structure!"
I dont think there is a quiz deadline.
Hello Nouralsahln and Everyone!
"Hi Madhusudan and All,"
"I have evaluated some essays of my peers. As a reader/reviewer of scientific papers, I understand and agree with the necessity to reduce the introductions (*e.g., 3 paragraphs*), but I have afraid that some new writers aren't taking the message perfectly. "
It will appear on the 15th prof <redacted> posted about this earlier in the week
Madhusudan indicates how to view the reviews but you are only expecting 3 reviews- we review 4 each but only 3 look at each essay
I don't think there's a deadline either- but I'm not sure when the course closes so don't leave them too long!
3 in 6 for me too. Maybe we should try buying a lottery
Final exam is worth 20%.
"I already corrected 4 assignments, but I could not see the feedback; Do I have to wait until the deadline of peer grading?"
"And those system zero-default bugs should be ignored, too."
"Frankly, I gave feedback when I felt the writer spent some time in writing the essay, and not just copy and paste from his/her article. When I saw those  types of essays, I just gave grade without feedback. Because some of the work needs tremendous editing and if he/she did not find the time, I am too ! "
"You are probably both right.  Giving low scores with no feed back does not promote learning.  If you do not know what to do with the essay reload the page without grading, it will select another essay to grade without posting a grade for the one you cannot figure out. "
To Kristin;
"Hello everybody,"
Hi all.
"One of my graders gave me a full 15, one gave a zero (marked it as plagiarism although it is an edit of the original) and the third a seven. This has led to very inconsistent feedback and a low final score. Is this my final score or is my essay still under consideration for plagiarism?"
"Thank you indeed! That was great! Thank you so much for practices and interviews with editors - they were real pearls that differ this course from many others. Kristin, I am gratitude to you for clear and lively presentation! Hope to have my first paper published in English this scholar year and wish all of you the same. Good luck and do your best ;)"
"Hello,"
"hmmm... good in theory, maybe unfeasible in practice.  That added layer or two of review will necessarily add more time/delay and there will always be those who don't agree with the edit reviews--so how many layers will be enough?  As for \zero-default bugs,\"" how can you tell positively the zero was due to a glitch and not an uncaring reviewer or the honest opinion of a tough reviewer?  What one sees as inconsistency may well  be consistent if explained but who has the time and program capability to do that?"""
"Hi All,"
I understand you should resubmit #1 or #2. The lowest grade will be dropped. I conclude: you can't lose!!
It will likely be unflagged shortly.
Welcome!

Hi
"My essay got graded 14 (!), 10 and 10. What should the final grading be?"
Peer reviewing does bring out the best and the worst in people. Let's stay professional no matter how much we loathe this process. :-)
"Can someone please help?  I currently only have 61% for this class because all the quizes appear blank as far as the bars that appear for other assignments I did except one quiz.  I took all the quizes timely, rescored as appropriate, and yet it appears in the Progress section that I only took one quiz, which is incorrect."
"Hi,"
Peer grading system is seriously flawed.
I have the same issue Mark. Hopefully it'll be up and running soon.
I would request the course coordinator to improve the  essay grading system.
I agree. I know that this has helped my own writing and I will be better able to edit others' scientific writing using what I've learned here.
Thank you very much.
"If you are not satisfied with the scores of essay # 1 or 2 , you can submit a third essay; it may be on a new topic or a revised one of the earlier essays."

It is all in so many previous posts
"Kristin, I think when we sacrifice less pertinent details, we sometime loose the opportunity to expand the knowledge of the reader.  I find, that some of the information helps me understand a little better the biology of the processes going on.  There has to be a balance. I have read a number of science books lately which I think has got the balance about right e.g. Lawrence Krause's \A Universe from nothing:Why there is Something rather than Nothing\"".  I wish I had this course available to me when I began my writing.  It is now proving useful as I now have time and the interest to do some more scientific papers since retiring."""
Ithink the problem with the peer review buttons is that if you press the down or up arrows itskips to the nextbutton. Instead. click on the scroll bar.
Follow Up:  I just received a response from Meagan in tech support.  The few classmates that suggested that the peer review process had not opened yet were correct.  Hope this helps. L.

"In revising the writing assignments 1 and 2 of my peers I found -in at least 3 essays- that the \instructions for authors\"" (the assingment instructions) are NOT met. For example: a) the words are much less than 300 and/or b) the writing of the essay does not match with any of the suggestions given by the teacher. For example in assignemnt 1 i recieved an essay on Dolphins when the suggestions where to write about a published paper or a person in science. The current metrics for measuring the output of the assignments has to incorporate a item where the instructions are met, in a similar way than in plagiarism (e.g. being able to flag a essay that does not meet the instructions). Accomplishing the instructions for authors is a vital aspect of the publication process so I would suggest that a metric for this aspect is incorporated in the current way of grading. Hope my comment helps! :) I love the course and find it super exciting, this is a comment only to imporve it furhter!"""

For writing assignment 2, there was no peer grading done and said it was plagiarised which is actually not with automatic checker and asked us to post as writing assignment 3. Now where is the chance/opportunity for me to increase the score for my writing assignment 1 and i feel there is no fair job done in assessing the assignments. I am very much disappointed with the scoring system."

"I have done writing assignment 1 but not satisfied with the score for which i have resubmitted my essay incorporating the peer review comments before due date for one more grading, but did not receive any grading for this and my score remained the same.

I agree with Saima- the peer reviewing is a bit difficult like this and the grades vary a lot (in my case for the same essay between 8 and 15!) It_s also too bad that many reviewers just clicked the numbers and did not edit anything in the text or made any comments- so it is hard to improve and you are not sure if they even read your essay... Maybe it would be good to get your essay graded by the staff if you have the feeling that the peer reviewing was not made properly. 
I submitted the second version of Writing Assignment 2 almost a week ago but my scores and comments are still reflecting my first submission. Is anyone else experiencing this problem? How can I resolve it?

"If you drag the bottom right hand corner of the text window, where there are two grey lines, you will be able to see most of the essay (how much you can actually see will depend on the size of your screen)."
This is actually not true in my case. I got 3 peer assignments in my 2 assignment. One peer reviewer gave me zeros in all cases. I got in the end a final grade which was the average of all three. This is very frustrating. 
Same problem to me.The peers were said to ask me to put citatios and they given zero for all points.They have many options to check to identify the paper is fake or not.If they have doubt they will check it in google search for identify the paper is original or not.After that they can give the score.But they didn't do anything and completely made unwanted problem to submitted persons.Take care in peer grading.It is very very important.
I have a background in Engineering and Audiology. I agree the principles taught in this course can be applied to many forms of writing. 
So you are saying you never received any marks for both assignments? I find that a bit hard to believe. Did you go to Assessment Panel - problems you have submitted and then writing assessment 1/2. There should be a mark for each of the essays except they were both marked for plagiarism. With the third essay you can still improve your mark - therefore I would hand it in!
"Interesting, thank you!"
"I hadn't appreciated the history of these courses, that's really interesting Sudarshan, thanks. It appears that MOOCs are still developing and working out where they want to sit within the overall educational family. I think one of their main challenges, if they attempt to join the mainstream (for lack of a better phrase), will be in gaining universal acceptance of any type of credit - I'm sure many of us (and definitely yourself having seen your linked-in profile) have struggled with equivalence of qualifications from various places (not just geographical but sometimes inter-professional). "
I want to join the greetings. Thank you very much.
there have been lots of suggestions if you look through the list of posts
There are some amazing MOOCs available (like this one!) but I'm not sure how seriously they are taken by employers as its often quite easy to game the system or just do the minimum needed to get a certificate. 
Could you kindly tell me if the number of revised writings is being calculated? I have already submitted 4 assessments and it persists offering me further revising. Thank you!
Hi

same problem...
Essay 3 is optional or compulsory?
Please guide me.
Hello
"Yeah, there are no buttons there.  Those buttons do exist on my first essay though.  It's weird!!"
Maybe you can send it as Assignment 3 instead?
its optional
Can it be that nobody graded me for more than 12days. i am worried
I get the feeling that these 0 marks are errors not deliberate. Obviously there are no guarantees but at least you will have the best scores from 3 rather than having to accept the two you currently have -  you can't get a worse grade than you currently have so there is nothing to lose from editing one of your pieces and submitting surely?

it's shows the progress now thank you!
Got it! Thank you
"Hi everyone! Eu sou do Brasil tambem, mas moro nos EUA."
I also need help! I hit submit and had one of my scores changed to a 0 instead of what I wanted to give them.
"I am not agree with my peer grading. The first one just graded all with 2 and no corrections, and the second one graded organization and focus with 0. I was not agree with my peer grading so I was submiting my essay again but the page sent me an error message in pink color before the deadline time (17:50 in my time zone). "
"I'm sorry to hear that :( Seems like someone was not very attentive to your work and rather acted according to some \pattern\"" in giving the grades."""
thanks! it helped in the end!
I submitted my homework before deadline.
"Say I presented a poster at a scientific meeting or gave a lecture, would it be wrong to copy from my own work when writing an article about the same work?. Or it may be the other way around, borrowing from my own paper when doing a lecture or poster presentation."
"Do we have a final exam? This item is listed under progress, but not under courseware. When will it be posted?"
"You can revise it based on the suggestions given, or you could just amend it yourself based on what you think is better (or a little of both). Just try your best to make it better, you have nothing to lose :)"
"I guess, we have to wait after the Essay 2 deadline."
"I've never had a problem in presenting MOOCs as evidence of CPD; I just list as personal development with the course title and sponsoring body (eg \Harvard presented through edX\"" or in this case simply \""Stanford Online\""). "
"GOOD AFTERNOON, I HAVE A PROBLEM THE ICON ASSESSMENT PANEL KEEPS HAVING AN EXCLAMATION MARK NEXT TO IT, DOES THIS MEAN I HAVEN AN ISSUE WITH THE ASSIGMENTS? I IMAGINE THAT`S WHY I CAN NOT SEE MY PEER REVIEWS ON THE ASSIGMENTS, CAN ANY ONE HELP ME??"
Dear Kristin:
"Patience, my friend, is a virtue :)"
Ii thought it was cause d by using the up and down arrows.
You can access peer reviews of all the submitted essays from two places:
"Dear Kristin,"
"You can edit on an iPad - you don't need a special App, just use the peer grading window."
This is a really helpful explanation! Thank you very much!
Same here
There's a message saying its not available yet so try back later - just a case of being patient I guess
"I would like to join to the greetings. This course has been a breath of fresh air for me, that has shown me how to prepare nice and fancy texts. That's the knowledge I will use for sure in the future, not only to write academic papers but also in everyday correspondence. It has been something utterly deferent then the style I was taught through my education process. Thank you very much for you work and the work of the whole team."
"Hi, as regards the introduction we had to write for assignment 2 the corrections I got are completly mistaken because they change the meaning of what the paper wants to say. I think this misscorrection cannot discount points from my grading. If I follow these corrections I change the concept of the paper."
GOTCHA! :-)
"Hi Jason,"
Same as yours.
Hi
Perhaps that suggestion should be ignored then - it's up to you to decide whether to act on the suggestions of your reviewers :)
The same here! I guess we will have to wait.
"I was aware of the ghost grade changing issue and was careful to deselect the grading region before navigating down the page. Additionally, I checked (and double/triple checked) my grading, and I only noticed changed scorings after performing the peer edit. "
Will it be possible to re-submit essay#3 after peer review?
Me too
Thanks very much everyone :)!
Hmm it always seems to disappear when I've done my reviews - afraid I can't help in that case folks. Have you searched through the discussion forum to see if there's an answer anywhere else?
"Hello everybody,"
"> I am an English teacher, and I just want to help my daughter, who is a doctor, when she has to write papers. Or teaching doctors as well."
"I thought I could improve my essay 2 so resubmitted it (around the 9th or 10th); however, the only peer reviews I see are those for my first attempt at this essay and not the second revised one. Is this because new reviews have not been done, or that the first reviews were better so the others were not even shown? My revised essay shows up in the essay box and time to submit has passed, but all reviews show comments on my first attempt. My score was not bad but I was hoping to get it higher."
Everyone with a possibility of getting a distinction (90% & over) currently has to have between 70 and 80% as the final exam is worth 20%.
Just interested in knowing some stats! Just to see how I stand among peer!
"check in the course info, because there it's explained that you'll have the same chances as for 1 and 2. I just hope we have enough time, cuz peer gradings proceeding are being slower than previous..."
It is the same with me. Essay 2 was submitted on time and I made the 4 required peer grading for writing assignment 2.
"yes, I have the same thing. I have 69% as of now. Was working toward distinction but my essays were all 80%."
"I have exactly the same situation, but I DO hope the third assignment will improve it.  I got no edits for Essay 1, just the grade 10/15. Well, it's not really bad, but I wanted to read some constructive criticism and got none;( The number is exact, I guess."
I have 75% as of now! Submitted essay 3. Keeping fingers crossed to get good reviews!
"You can download all the slides and videos, so they can be available as long as you want."
"I have a co-worker who received a manuscript back from a publisher with a vague remark from a reviewer (just one) saying \Have the paper reviewed by a technical editor before re-submission.\""  I suspect the reviewer never had Prof. <redacted>'s class, as the paper is very clear, concise, and well written (and in the active voice throughout!).  I think they were expecting a typical, poorly written, jargon-filled paper, and clear language put them off."
Thanks for your answers! I just wanted to know if the low scores were taken into account even when there was no editing!
Have you seen the new post in the course info? Could this be the reason?
I'm on 73% and crossing my fingers for essay 3 to bump it up a little and take some pressure off the final exam.
You have to submit once and then submit again - you should see a green tick or a red cross next to your answer.
"Dr. <redacted>, will you be doing your *Statistics in Medicin*e course again any time soon? I'm trying to get on a watch list for it, but can't figure out how. :)"
I can now see the window :)
71% Hoping to ace the final exams and get a score above 13 on Essay 3.
Likely in spring or summer of 2014. I'm not sure that OpenEdX has a watch list...
It should work now!
This is fixed now! Sorry about the delay!
The peer review is now available. There was a delay so that we could receive and grade a sufficient number of calibration essays.
"The course archives will be left up indefinitely, so you can continue to access the materials."
"I conduct health services research in the U.S. and thus, many of my research projects touch upon system and policy related concerns."
"Hi, Dr. <redacted>!"
I am also interestd in this course.Will keep checking.
"I sent in Assignment #  early, but peer assessment is slow...really want to improve if grade is not so good."
"I agree with MJSpiering-- often reviewers will make such comments offhand. However, it might be worth having a colleague read it over-- even the best-written papers can benefit from an editor. "
What do you mean by the peer grading window? Do you mean what I am referring to as the the number scoring system which I am suggesting to use or do you mean something else? Please clarify.
"Just competed peer review for essay 3, am awaiting assessmenr."
"Thank you! I'll keep checking. I missed the first time this course was offered, too, but was patient and just kept checking until it was offered again."
I submitted a written piece of work to one of my PhD supervisors - applying all the new techniques learnt in this course.
"You can make coloured comments, deletions etc.using the iPad in exactly the same way as on a PC. Just scroll down to the same screen you would use for grading on a PC and make your comments. See screenshot."
i hope to gain distinction in this course but essay no.2 not graded up till now
73%
OK great . on which topic you are working currently and give me some information about Phd position opportunities in your university
63%
It's neck and neck for me. Am on 70. have to get 20/21 in final exam. Anyway submitted essay 3 and willing to resubmit as well..
I have 73% with assignment 3 pending but I don't care about distinction as I loved the course and learned a lot.
I did it and can thoroughly recommend it
TNX for the Dr.<redacted> that course was extreme useful and I'm be prided to be distinguished.
There are some people who all have the same problem: They submitted their 2nd essay before the deadline on November 1st and they didn_t got any grades until now. 
Mine is 76% 
the subject says it all. please comment.
"No chance, I'm afraid. It's my situation also. "
73 it is. Thanks for my essay reviewers for a perfect 50.
Using assignment 3 gives you an opportunity for additional points (unless both essays were marked at 15) worth submitting surely?
I am actually a reviewer for multiple journals and surprisingly find a lot of grammatical errors which make reading difficult.More importantly the take home message is often not clear so it may be advisable for someone else to independently go through the paper.I often give the paper to some nontechnical person to read and am surprised at the number of typographical/grammatical errors that creep up which can at times even change the meaning and  sometimes a fresh pair of eyes s required. It is like when someone is deep frying onion rings (or something else equally tasty) - everyone else can smell it well except the person frying !!
"Hello everyone,"
@Madhusudan-Vijayan: Thats great and lucky I should say.
"Hi Valens, and Everyone,"
"Hmm, you fared better than I-- one of my reviewers complained about the language, then suggested grammatically incorrect edits that made a hash of my text. Unfortunately, by this stage, our peers are probably rushing through their required edits to get their essays graded."
I feel like I have to jump in for some protection of the peer-reviewers:
Have to say my experience is very similar. Like you I'm happy with the overall gradings but editing often leaves me baffled. My lowest score on essay 3 was 10 - this reviewer added a 3 work edit and commented 'too much words'! If this was really their only problem with my work  then surely more effort should have been put in to providing revisions. 
"If nothing has been changed from the original script, it should be flagged. If some kind of revision has been made, then its ok. "
"Hi EElliott, i tried Linkedin,  but it seems not possible, it requires e-mail add (or, i'm not so good in doing this :) )"
Probably just an error during submission
"Thanks Michaela, I did, but then asks for e-mail and all turns red.  :( -T"
Did it! Yeah!! :) -T
"I agree with Micahela - I submitted Essay 3 and my chances are better now, though I can only make one mistake in the final exam."
There are no scores for essay 3. Right?
"I read Theoretical Physics for my first degree, did a master's in Applied Maths - really geophysical fluid dynamics for meteorology / oceanography - and failed to get a job in it, worked for a long time in IT, and am now retraining as a statistician.  Which makes me, um, interdisciplinary?"
Of course there are scores for essay 3!
"Well done, I've added you too"
"Thank you staff team and peer reviewers . I had my 3rd assignment graded, received a good score and good feed back. On the whole this course was useful and i enjoyed the course work.i hope to pursue this as a career soon. "
"Yes, everyone can picture what a half is, but they cannot picture how much it is. Is it half an orange, or half a ton of oranges? 0.3 to 0.<zipRedac>5 contains the same information, but also gives a notion of the risk relative to the population. However, some people cannot immediately comprehend numbers like these. <zipRedac>5 women per <zipRedac>0000 per year gives the same information, plus people can visualize it immediately. It also underlines the social value of the new drug."
"Yeah, it would be great to hear from engineering too :)"
"Funny thing. My last essay got 15 from 2 reviewers. But the third reviewer lambasted it and gave me 6, saying that he couldn't understand the medical part in it."
i am not able to resubmit my essay 3. please do help me out
"hi i have submitted my optional essay 3 only once, but when i am attempting to submit it again it says you have finished your 2 attempts. if i have finished i haven't got the new grades too. i want to resubmit it to increase my score. how can i submit it for the second time?"
"Sejal, click on \New Submission\"" under Writing Assignment 3"""
"Rajhansa had mentioned in a post to \ignore\"" it. See here:"
"Yah, I've seen this now and again: it's neither usual nor rejected in the field I am currently reading in."
Just as long as we don't use 'that which'.  I am sure that is clutter :)
"It looks like you have made 2 submissions. Unfortunately, you cannot submit more than 2 essays for the assignment!"
"The final exam will consist of 21 multiple choice questions, and it will be released tomorrow!"

"Hi,"
They were same scores and same comments!
And you think it doesn't answer your question? 
"\Yes I got that, which made it clearer...\"" would be correct though?"""
"Don't ignore, put in the covering letter why you can't do it!"
It is surely not unreasonable to expect that an instructor will use the contacts she has made in her work. As Kristin is a statistician and writer working in the medical sphere the choice of interviewees is hardly surprising.
I edited my Essay 1 following the few workable suggestions (even though I didn't personally feel they improved the writing) and got... exactly the same score (13/15). This time though I also received no feedback beyond a comment from my first reviewer who thought the conclusion was too short.
"I see that some of you share my doubts... When I posted my first essay, and I got essays to grade, I've spent a lot of time on them, especially one, that I gave low grades for. I tried hard to give some usefull suggestions. In my opinion, when I give low grade, I should give more comments. Imagine then my disappointment, when I got my own work graded - with almost no comments... :( I understand, when someone gives me 13 points, sometimes does not exactly have the idea, what to improve. But when someone gives me 5 points, then I rather expect my essay full of insertions/deletions/comments..."
Hi 
"Why does the post content changed when I knew that I have checked for spelling errors? Normally I type in word and paste it on the website, but why is it that it keeps inserting some strange marks?Just curious."
Did they mention about the time frame for this final exam?
"Our peers are reviewing our essays based on the lessons of this course. So, it might work against you if you followed the kind of format you have described."
Yes they have. Start is Novemver 15 and due date is Nov 22
"Dear Kristin,"
It is still <zipRedac>4 November at Stanford U!
"What I feel is by the end of the course, all of us will have some wonderful learning experiences - mostly useful and some amusing. (One peer-reviewer who gave me 15/15 also gave me some encouraging comments, and the second one who gave the same score gave me some useful suggestions whereas the third reviewer who gave me 1/15 gave no comments, but made a lot of mistakes by way of editing!). I got the grade I deserve plus some encouraging feedback, and some stuff to have fun!!!"
I think this person simply made a mistake while submitting the essay...
"Hi,"
Mention that the current data are unknown.
My essay for assignment 3 has been flagged. I think it would be helpful if there was an indication as to what's the reason for flagging an essay.
I think it is not our job to check in this course if the presented scientific findings are correct. We are just checking that the essays are written properly.
Even same with me
"As you suspected all flagged work is reviewed by staff before being either released for further review or banned. Flagging occurs when the reviewer has checked the plagiarism suspected or offensive content box. There doesn't appear to be any requirement for a comment indicating the reason for flagging, although I think it would be a useful inclusion - at a minimum it could be used to direct those checking in the right direction."
The same thing happened to me as well. I think we should be given another chance to compensate this issue.
"I did not claim that it is not possible to give useful comments to someone who wrote a 15 point essay. But there are many people out there who are happy to write a 9 point essay, and they might not feel that they can help someone who already wrote a 15 point essay. "
"I got this on essay 2, never received a second grading..."
I have the same problem. Same scores and same comments.
"Hi to all, "
"Hello Ms. <redacted>, my question is the next:"
are peer reviewers paid? what advantage do they get from giving time to review a paper?
"Hi,"
How many peer reviews can our resubmitted essay have? I revised at least 8 essays but I only have 4 reviews for my essay (three of which were the same as when I submitted my essay the first time).
"Dear cavalier,"
"Dear <redacted>,"
And yet again the same with essay three. Two reviews with no feedback at all and one with low grades (that screwed up my score) and nonsensical feedback. I really did not understand what this person was saying and the English grammar was barely existing.
"Being a reviewer for a journal is good for your CV and career prospects. At my university you are expected to enter any reviews to your online profile, with a distinction between domestic (usually in Japanese) and international journals. It is part of the annual staff assessment and shows that you are recognised in your field."
"Hi Taiko, I appreciate reading your comment, it gives me a lot of additional information. Thank you!"
yes but it is not always that reviewers are from the universities.
The same thing happened with me for the first essay
"I am an engineer and I love the course. The basics of writing, publishing and  interviews applies to any scientific field.  "
ok. Thank you and look forward to your reply!:)
"Dear Dr. <redacted>,"
"I submitted twice my Writing Assigment 3, however there is still exist the first response (and my earlier submission  example). In the assessment panel the status of my Writing Assigment 3 is ¡®finished¡¯ (I graded 8 other works) and system noted the first only grading. I didn¡¯t receive the latest score, so I don't know if I improved my introduction."
I guess due to the time difference we won't be able to see it until tomorrow (Saturday here).
"It depends on your domain. In biology (my domain) nobody cares what you publish in a conference--this maybe exaggerate a little bit but since conferences are not peer reveiwed, people will not consider these results as final \true\"" results, and also many people avoid communicate their newest results in a conference because someone eles could working on the same thing and have their similar results, so you don't want them know your prgress. However, There are very prestigeous conferences in some dimain, such as CS and EE (and physics?), and these results are peer reviewed (from what I heard), it is also considered as high impact pulications if you get your results into one of those meetings. Please correct me if I am wrong."""
"Hi Julia, I myself am not a native speaker and think I still have a lot to improve, so I will not help you with your sciwriting. But I really recommend the books that Dr. <redacted> <redacted> recommended. Many other people recommend those books to. I read *the elements of style* and enjoyed it very much. I then read another book that is not on the list but find it also very helpful, which is *How to write and publish a scientific paper*. Hope those books will also help you."
Hello Taiko.  In which university?? Is this happening to all the Japanese universities? I am coming in Hokkaido for my PhD under MEXT scholarship. 
I can't see either.  I suppose it is not posted yet.
Not yet released? I can't find it yet.
Here is a good explanation: http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/which-versus-that-0
"According to the email for week 8, the final has 21 questions but will be scored out of 20, i.e. if you get 20/21, you still get 100%.  "
I noticed the same. It should have been set up to drop the lowest score (as the Essay section was)--since scores were 1 or 0 that would have eliminated a single incorrect answer as advised.
"It's there now, good luck!"
I'm in the same situation!!!
"Hello,"
"Thanks Kristin, this course was really interesting and useful for me, it boosted both style and enthusiasm."
I'll double check to make sure this is being calculated correctly. Thanks for letting us know!
"Thank you very much, <redacted>. This makes more sense now."
I'll have tech support look into this.
You will get a distinction. Congratulations!
"We'll fix this! It should be out of 20, not 21."
"Dear Dr.<redacted>,"
Problem fixed. Thanks.
"Hi Yarko, thank you very much for the article!"
When might we expect these after we take the final?
Prof <redacted> has already posted that it won't be until after the course closes on Nov 22 but there may be delays as it is a holiday period
" If you submit the same essay (>=95% identical to the original), you will not be regraded. If you want to change the essay substantially and resubmit, email: <emailRedac> ."
"I've double checked the question, and the answer key is correct."
"What were your 3 essay scores? I the final result is the median but there has been lots of confusion about this throughout the course with many thinking it's the middle score as they are presented (eg thinking 12,14,10 gives 14 but the median is actually the middle score when they are in order giving 10,12,14 so a score of 12)"
Thank you :)
Hello Micahela. I did not see your post before posting.  Bravo!! My score was 95% too.
I would like to ask the staff if there will be the possibility of submitting one of the two first essays again. Colleagues that joined us later were given the opportunity to do past homeworks.
Well done both of you. Very impressed with your scores!!
"Hi, Kristin!"
"The third essay is the chance to submit one of the first 2 essays again. Only your 2 highest essay scores count, so if you are only 2% away from distinction it should still be possible for you to get there with the third essay."
"I resubmitted for Essay 3; 2 reviewers gave me 1's and 2's with little or no edits or comments, and last reviewer gave me all 3's. Go figure. "
"Risk and risk reduction are difficult concepts to deliver to a general audience/readership. Previous posts are spot on when they indicate 'half of what' is the key question- the start point needs to be clearly defined. If I'm told my risk of breast cancer is halved or reduced by 50% because I take a drug does that mean I am guaranteed to get it if I don't? Of course not but without knowing what the actual risk of being affected is I might begin to panic thinking that without the 50% reduction I'm left with <zipRedac>00% - remember I'm already panicking and not thinking rationally as the 'c' word has been mentioned. The additional information that only, say, <zipRedac>5 in <zipRedac>0000 will be affected without the drug helps me make a much more informed decision. "
"how did you get distinction? I am 88.9, will it be possible to  get distinction? Actually, I felt like I am not good writer since my highest score for essay is 87and lowest is 80. I thought I was good writer."
"\Welocome to the Club\"" Beatrice! :))"
Tx Micahela! Yours is great too!! :) -T
Mine was graded correctly...
Thank you Mrs <redacted> and Stanford University for giving an amazing opportunity. I am passed with distinction.
"I like the idea of a pop-up window for  \are you sure about your final score?\"" I unfortunately noticed too late that several of my essays were wrongly scored after I clicked submit. I would have been willing to re-edit and re-score my essays after they discovered the bug!"""

"Dear all,"
Congratulations to everyone! It has been a fantastic course. An added bonus was my final score of 90% : )
"I agree Taiko, well done"
"Would be nice to do it, but it is useless since I don't remember what exactly the reviewers didn't like in my essay..."
"I was wondering if the course material (lectures, quizes) will remain accessible after the course ends? Or should we download the videos if we want to retain a copy?"
"My three peer review scores are: 10,14,13."
Is it possible that I can improve my grade as I have 88% and need 90% for distinction. Is it possible that I resubmit my third essay before the deadline?
"I have completed the final exam, all the essays and the post course survey. I have received my grades and I'm very happy. "
"It's a bit confusing because British and American usages vary slightly. IMO, it is best to learn both styles and adapt to the primary audience as necessary."
Congratulations to everyone. My score is 94%. This has been a unique experience. Impressed by the forum as well.Thanks.

"Hi Taiko, I'm Ale and I live in Poland. Where do you come from?"
It's been posted by prof <redacted> that will be available once course closes on nov 22 but holidays may cause delays
Well can you look at it with the eyes of a reviewer and make improvements to it yourself?
"Ok, thank you all so much! The course was great, now I will finish final question with an ease :)"
But make sure there are lots of changes as only those very different to previous version are passed for grading (recently posted in a response from Kristin)
I got 85% in the exam. How did you do Sudarshan?
Tx! Done! :) -T
me too thanks all the course staff. i learned a lot from them
thank you
I have not yet taken the finals. Will be doing it on Monday or so. :)
"We'll be in touch... Drop a note if you're visiting India again, we can try a SciWrite alumni meetup here... It has happened in other Stanford MOOCs and it is terrific..."
I have just worked out my overall grade at 89.7% but the progress report states 90%. Will I finish with a distinction?
"also me i got 89.5 % :( , i don't know if some way to calculate question number 21 from the final grade and like that we can cross the 90% and we receive a certificate with distinction."
"Hi can I ask ... pls. can anybody help me, how can I resubmit my essay ? Thanks"
"I'm from England, but have lived in Japan for 20+ years."
"Thank you Sudarshan! Impressed! You too, idem for Athens or Paris :) -T"
"This seems an eminently sensible thing to include in a resume (or CV as we would say in the UK) as a part of your professional development. As I've written many times when discussing this subject, in the many years of my professional working life I've completed innumerable professional development courses (and presented many), few of which were externally validated. This has not made then any less valuable to my employers, current or potential."
If the Progress page shows 90% or above you will have achieved the level required for *Distinction*.
"Evgenie, yes, and i'm in Athens too; hope to go to Boston for mine. Japan? Impressive!! Do you have a Fb, or Linkedin account? We could keep in touch if you like. Wish you all the great things come your way and the best of luck in Japan! :) -T"
"Do you claim that it is not a system failure, but normal functioning? I want to extract the most from the feedback, is it something too much to ask?"
Ohhh sounds good.. Thank you so much..I wish you the best too.. Yes I am leaving soon under the Japans' government scholarship.  Yes I have a facebook (<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>) you can add me.  I have an eagle for profile picture and a photo from Potos (Thasos) for cover..
"I totally agree, even if not used to 'accredit' formal education any evidence of personal development shows a willingness to learn that is sought by employers."
"No, I'm not suggesting there's nothing wrong just trying to help you to be able to submit before the deadline for assignment 3 as you aren't able to complete the reviews for assignment 1 to view the reviews. I didn't re-submit any of my work so don't know what happens to the review count or access to the initial reviews if you don't complete the additional 4 required"
"Come on guys, I got 75% and I am happy. You should be proud of your results, grades are one thing but we all learned a lot."
Alternatively contact tech support and ask for advice-they may be able to sort it out for you. Email in contacts page- link at bottom of page

Prof <redacted> posted earlier that where a large percentage of the work remains the same then it is not sent for further review so gets the same score and review. I have suggested that she pins this info to top of board as so many have encountered this without realising why. Am on phone so can't send link.

Finished the course and enjoyed it.Dr <redacted>- I would like to register for any other courses in writing as and when you announce them.
Welcome! :) -T
Thanks! for the useful links.
when can we get the statement of accomplishment
After course closes on nov 22
thank you Micahela :)
Where can I check my first and last name for the  statement of accomplishment?
I fully agree with Taiko's suggestions. 
It might look like this: 
What are the prerequisites for this course?
"My final score stands 81%, and I think I've learned a lot.Cheers!!!"
"I just want to thank Dr. <redacted> and the team of this course! The information is very useful and I really feel that my writing has improved. Unfortunately, nobody taught me scientific writing in my university and now I see why some of my papers were rejected by the journals I chose. So you are doing a great thing!"
"Michaela, it was identical to Tia's: 76% -> 100% -> 96%"
Thank you Professor <redacted> <redacted>!
Dear staff: 
"As a reviewer, I would like the opportunity to re-review the same essay if it is revised and resubmitted. A check box could be added that says \Would you like to review this essay again if it is resubmitted?\"" Re-review would only be possible within the same essay assignment. This option could only be invoked if the essay is actually edited or commented on. Reviewers who provide no feedback other than scores would not be allowed this opportunity."
me too...
I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Italy
You get name and email edit options when you click on the button (with your forum name) in the top right corner
"Kudos, Professor <redacted>! This is the best-taught MOOC I've ever taken!"
"I got 89%, could I receive a distinction certificate?"
"Im sorry to ask about it, but I will =) I have 89% progress, it is almost 90% =) And I will not receive Statement of Accomplishment with distinction, right? But anyway thank you so much for this great course! I really love it and upset that it comes to end =("
"Hi,  I want to submit an edited version of essay 2  for the final writing assignment (Essay 3).  My grade for Essay 2 was a bit higher than Essay 1, so I don't want Essay 1 to be counted... So in the end, will Essay 2+3 be calculated, even though they are based on the same material? Thanks very much!"
Hi!
"Funny that is probably what I will receive too. I took the third essay option hoping to bump it up into Distinction, but after making the suggested changes the peer reviewers suggested and the next reviewers gave me a lower grade than before, but it was all a great learning experience even though I have been writing professionally for over 30 years, I still picked up some good points."
"From the link you provide it looks like they use our userename, not our full name? Yours will say \Sudarshan\"" and mine will say \""<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>\""? For the first person in this thread the statement will say \""chenfei\""? For the other it will say \""Micahela\""? This is odd to me."""
"Well, we're not much lucky! =) I made test 19/21, if it was 20/21 I would have 90%. But yeah I agree with you, it is a great learning experience, Im happy to be here!"
But I hope you will escape my fate!
"According to Prof <redacted> - in another post - you won't be able to resubmit your essay if it is 95% identical to the first submission. So, go ahead, make some changes and try again. Good luck."
":D quite clear now, but I guess I would have to revisit this often to remind myself"
Thank you Stanford U for the wonderful opportunity to glimpse behind the ivy; truly fun.
I received 15/15 from one reviewer for the essay for which another reviewer gave me 5/15
as a result i scored only 87 % even when i did the course will complete dedication
"The test is supposed to be marked out of 20, have they got your mark correctly calculated?"
"I scored 95%. First, I'd like to thank you all, from classmates to Kristine, because it has been a fantastic time with you."
Good comment!
"Thank you, had just copied it from your other post to pop in here :)"
My previous course certificate has my full name not my forum user name
You can check what will appear by looking at your settings using the drop down showing your forum username at the top right corner
"Now, what should I do to get my statement of accomplisment (with distinction, since I scored 95)??"
We are on the same boat my friends. I too have an 89% score. :)
+1 :)
"As according to Dr. <redacted>, it should be the middle of the three grades. My three peer grades were: 10,14,13. I should get 14 score, not score 13.It will affect my grade, from 88 to 90%, I won't be able to get distinction. See her post on 21st October, she said it should be the middle grade, she didn't mention that it is the median of the three grades:"
"I think that we, the students, would be very interested in that information; however, it might open the course to thousands of unfair questions about what is fair. "
"I haven't take the survay, but all questions in the Final are covered during the course."
Absolutely! I agree 100% with <redacted>. Thank you!
"Whaa?  The final questions were all completely to the course, and the multiple choice answers made complete sense to me.  I also found the survey displayed just fine in both Chrome and IE."
Did anyone get a peer grade score like 0/0/2/3/3? What does this mean? is this a valid score or due to some error?
Unless you still have the option to improve your essay score by submitting or re-submitting essay 3 of course
"Thank you!! PS the \Educational Jargon Generator\"" you posted was amazing :)"""
The shorter the better: 
"Yes, please, I would like to know the same thing as Shukla."
"I had the same question, tks!!"
i have not received any grading for my second submission for 3rd essay.
I joined just now and noticed that the course is half way through. I want to join the next session and could please let me know when is it start?
"hi,by mistake i submitted a complete blank form of the post course survey. but there is only one attempt to fill the form. can you please arrange for a second attempt as i am eager to take the survey to thank the course coordinators for this excellent learning experience!"
I'm working in watermelon stressed by boron toxicity and deficiency.
That's true.  I didn't find anything shocking about the final test or the survey.  I really don't understand what <redacted> is talking about.
"I summarized a paper in one of my earlier assignment and got zeroes. Hence, I never attempted summarizing for the next two.Rather try to read some paper on a choicest topic and then create an original paper with your own language except technical references ( such as 33.5mm was the minimum depth found..XYZ et al , 1989)"
"Enjoyed the finals. A few of the questions were quite tricky, which truly tested the understanding. The survey also corresponded well to the pre-course survey, and meaningful trends can be derived from it."
"No it uses the name as provided, and there is still an opportunity to change it like Michaela mentions above."
"Elizabeth, I've signed up for Hippocrates Challenge: https://novoed.com/hc"
"The middle score doesn't mean (sorry, another statistical term) the middle reviewer's score. It is the score that lies (another statistical artifact) between the highest and lowest scores. They could have called it \median\"" but I might have mistaken it for the stones running along the center of the road... :)"""
"Pooja, I hope the OpenEdX platform is fixed for future courses. Technical issues should not ruin the credibility of a great course. "
"I can understand zero grades, but what is the basis for flagging it?"
"Sheesh, this all could've been made much clearer by putting the grade (the one ultimately assigned) as one or three...eg 11,14,12 gives 12; 13,15,11 gives 13.  It is the MEDIAN grade, look it up!  It is not when the score was given... staff was not so arbitrary as to merely assign the second grade as the overall grade--there'd be no basis at all for doing that.  Now, if there are 3 essays (that includes one revision) the scores will be the highest 2. There is enough reading without having to reread redundant posts. 8-("
"I cannot delete/edit  my prev. comment, so I need to update it with this comment now. Thank God!, I now have %91, as a result of a bump in my score for Essay 3. If you still have another chance on essay 3, please do not miss it. It might help you to bump your score to or above %90."
It's the final submission that counts
The low score doesn't affect your essay grade- it's the median score that is used
wouldn't it be alma mater matris...?
"was fine with me, I struggled on only 2 of them but got them right after some thinking. it's an open book test after all. I use Firefox."
"Hi,"
"I have exactly the same problem, although no problem with my peer review scores ( my second essay did deserve the 67% it got, since it was bloody boring in retrospect!). I do take offence at the peer reviewers not even bothering to edit a single word. I spent at least an hour and a half on each peer review myself, and, as a statistical ecologist, the careful editing of all those medical essays was frustrating to say the least. Trolls, indeed!"
I would also like to congrat Prof. <redacted>. It was a very useful course.
I think that is an error. I also think the peer grading needs improvement...
Brilliant! Thanks very much :)!
I also made test 19/21!and get 89% on the whole! hehe
got exact 90%.. phew!!!!!!!!!!! feeling good:)
"I would like also!I had 87%, so close of 90% for the distinction...I think unfair having just the same that other just with an 60%..."
" if you're interested in peer-reviewing tandems, mostly about medicine, neuroscience and endocrinology (since I'm an MD), please email me @ <emailRedac> !! Best wishes, <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
"sorry, just forget what I'm said.."
i am not happy at all with my grade in essay 3. i know my capability in writing and its a total disappointment for me.
@sagargvsr and @zeba.. so guys how did the course go?
Hi! Can anyone guide me as to which video lecture discusses about citing previous paper in a manuscript...etc. Thanks!
Suggestion for administrators: 
I did the writing assignment 3 and after receiving the peer review I did the adjustments and send it again. After I completed the peer review necessary I received the correction but realized that this was related to my first attempt. Does anyone knows why is that?
I am interested in this too! Thanks!
"Hey why? Especially when English is not your mother tongue. I ended up with 82, not native English, and I am OK with my success! "
Hi.
How and when will I get the statement of accomplishment? Will I get a hard copy or soft copy?
"peer grading although consisted of 50%, it was complete fiasco. It is at the heart of the grading. I passed with 91, but I probably deserve more than that but again did not benefit from peer.Dr Kristin however is talented I know and I should thank hear for writing clearly. I liked the cut the clutter aspect of the class although I am not sure if we should cut all the time. I see published articles titles and I feel like what a waste of words. But again, why should things always be short? That I have no answer. At least I will avoid using there are or the phrases such as \The study of bla bla..\"""""
It will be e-mailed to you when the course is finished.
I think 90% is reasonable on this course. It was possible to get a 90% average on peer grading of the essays.
Updated address:
It is Unit 5 last slides - you are to reread
and you can print it
"Hi all,"
that's a good advice - thank you very much
That's more or less what I put in my course feedback Sudarshan. I also feel that it was a beta version that hadn't been tested properly nor were the staff fully aware of the idiosyncracies of the system. Not suggesting there was anything wrong with the course but more testing should have been performed or participants should have been told it was a new system and we were 'guinea-pigs'
ya me too. i got exact 90%.. but the course info says that we have to get above 90%.. someone please clarify whether i will get distinction?
it completely eludes me how someone would do this for a course that gives no credits anyway.
I would like to know this too. Will they send via e-mail to each one?
"you can download all the videos and slides. you can also, in theory, copy-paste all the quiz questions if you have the patience."
what u mean by hatter?
You are not alone. I got a score of 0/0/2/3/3 for essay 3. What kind of person would give a score like that?!
Thank you everybody for your answers. I would love to take Dr <redacted>'s statistics course!!! But I live in The Netherlands.
I have enjoyed the course and learned a lot as I can apply it to my everyday activities.
How about 89.6%? It was rounded-up to 90% in my progress chart. Am I going to get a distinction too?
Sure you will! Congrats!
"I got an email from Kristin, and she said 90% is a distinction :)!"
"I passed...did not attain a distinction. However, I must comment all those who helped in making certain clarifications. This course was delivered in an outstanding manner, no stone was left unturned. I have am glad that I did it."
thanks alot for this lesson
"Just found this course which was recommended by my friend.Although I am late,I am sorry about that,but I will try my best to catch it.Nice to meet you all.Let's keep fighting!!"
"I am an engineering student, and really enjoy this class."
Just frustrated.
i also had the same score. i feel this person was not going through the essay.
"Similar story here, ended up with 88% because of the peer review scores... didn't really mind until I post in this forum from a guy who got 92% but could not even write a proper English sentence. He made 5 spelling/grammar errors in a 10-word sentence but somehow received scores of 13 or more on his essays? I hope that MOOC organisers will someday realize that peer assessment just doesn't work, and that quizzes/exams should be much harder instead."
Hello.
"I submitted my essay 3 and only saw scores for 3 out of the 5 areas assessed. I think this is in error given that the peer reviewers comment said \no edits\"". How can I rectify this?"""
that is why I did not resubmit. I figured i could not do better than waht I got.
"Dear kristin,"
"Same frustration here, reviewers (Peer reviewers) are not grading it properly and just giving the scores, that too low without giving any appropriate reasoning. One of them who gave proper reasoning and nice suggestions graded 13, while others gave 5 or 6 without even any reason. That's really not fair. Now max I can score due to there unreasonable behavior is 88%"
"There will be a mail, which will guide you through a link to download the certificate and the same link will be available at the dashboard section"
Totally agree to what you and Matt has said. I am so frustrated with the peer review scores
"Dear Rajhansa,"
Please see Prof. <redacted>'s answer here:
Does it change anything whether your certificate says with distinction or not?
"My question, too."
"It was wonderful but I registered late and actually missed the \distinction\"" grade because the system did not accept delayed homeworks. I suggest to rearrange it in next MOOCs so that those who have registered late have the same opportunity as others. Thanks again."""
She has posted that it will be after course closes on 22 Nov
My two cent:
You could wait for the next offer of this course and start early...
"Hello, good luck!"
See: https://www.coursera.org/course/statreasoning
"The other OpenEdX course I took had only one deadline for all the assignments - the last day of the course! This enabled the late registrants to catch up at their own pace. This was possible there because there were no mandatory peer reviews, which would require a set schedule."
"Any apriori knowledge required for this course, Michaela?"
"Click on \Courseware\"". All the lecture videos, homework, quizzes and assignment can be found there."""
"I my country we have a saying \They offered him a horse, and he was checking its teeth\"". I mean, this is a free course, it has its rules and terms.  Those who enrolled have --i guess all of us have-- programs, and schedules, and so on. Those committed completed the course on time. "
"I don't suppose it would be realistic to expect the course administrators to review all the scores close to Distinction. Obviously, there would be thousands. But it would be nice if that were possible."
thank you so much for the info:)
I'd wear that T-shirt! :)
"When I have accessed to my last assay after peer-grading, I could see the score of each reviewer, but any modification was done in none of the three revisions. In this way, it is quite difficult for me to improve my assay, which is the same I submitted as Assay 2 (and the response of the peer-reviewers was the same: only score and no comments). It was the same with other two persons following the course in my Centre. Since I try to do my best acting as a peer-review, **I totally disagree in considering the scoring of peer-reviewers without a real review work**. I would like to emphasize this point, because it is easy to read a text and check the boxes, but I think this is not the aim of the course and this point must be considered."
It will be e-mailed to you.
And I design radiation-hard integrated circuits :)
"I encountered some problems in writing assignment 3. I submitted it and, as I got a mark I considered unfair, I improved the text and resubmitted. I did 4 extra peer reviews, but nothing happens, I'm not being evaluated again. I really would like to solve it, since I only need a 1% more to get the mention..."
Could be a technical glitch again.
I tried to take the HTA course but found it too late! They would not let me join. :(
With me it worked the other way round. My Essay 3 got more points than the first attempt and I managed to get a distinction!
My experience with the third essay indicates the third essay offer should be dropped. I incorporated some of the suggested changes (now realize that was not a good idea) One reviewer did not even check all the boxes and I received a lower grade then on my earlier submissions. Also it being the end of the course; I probably did not devote as much effort to my reviewing as I should have.
Good points B¨¦atrice! :) -T
Maybe they can drop the least score in self-assessments too ! ( I mean the home works)
I have got distinction too.Congrats to all who participated to this course with me.
"Re: Python, I've been considering these:"
"But remember that, as the two best scores from your essays are the ones that count towards the final grade, it is impossible for your overall score to be made worse by essay three - you can only improve your grade."
Dear Kristin
"One more question, if I get distinction, can I claim I am a good writer from now one? At least how do I par with good writers? What else do I need to get better? I feel like I improved but I am not sure if I can boast about it? How many got 100%?"
"I had the same problem in the 3rd Assignment! Even if the changes are small, we have two attempts for each report!!"
I feel that distinction should me made for above 80% of score..
It's happened to me as well
That's quite unfair; so we have correct 4 extra reports and we are not having any review from our work! I though I had another chance to improve and get a better grade! I got 12/15 in my first attempt and a did a few changes after receiving the feedback to try to have a higher grade and get a pass with distinction- I got 89% now.
thanks a lot for the link
"You are not alone! I did exactly same thing as you did and got the same results, no new score for my new submission! I do not think my article was sent out to the peer grading pool. Can anyone solve this technique issue?"
"I agree with my fellow classmates as I just missed distinction by a % , left me feeling utterly dissapointed. Dr.Kristin it would great if you consider the idea. Looking forward and fingers crossed."
"It was never possible, agree."
I was about to wrap up my coursework by taking the survey when I couldn't help notice this blatant (and frequent) misuse of a modifier. Can you spot what's wrong with this sentence?
Probably best for you to have a look at the outline- it's available on the courses homepage Sudarshan.
But unless more than 5% of the report is different from the first attempt no further grading is performed
"you need to actually write more, real stuff and get it published, and then you will see how your reception is. "
well done :)
"87%... so close, yet so far..."
Thanks!
Hi
"Micahela is correct. If you have not changed the essay in a substantial way (a real revision), the essay will not be re-scored."
I don't think that there will be an appeal system for this type of course
I'd agree--it's best not to keep scientific readers in suspense! The reader wants to know what your study is about as quickly as possible.
"It's possible that some of the buttons reset to zero, as this has been a known technical glitch. Hopefully, the peer provided some helpful feedback in addition to the grade."
We will post some statistics after the course ends! It may take a week or two to compile.
You're welcome! Glad you enjoyed the course!
Thanks for the nice notes!
Thanks for the nice note!
"We round up, so 89.5% is treated as 90%."
Congratulations!
Thanks for the nice note and for acknowledging my fantastic support team!
I want to mention one technical problem related to the peer-review system that affects  my account. 
I personally feel that it is a waste of resources to regulate funding sources of scientific research. A better approach would be a system that rewards data sharing and reproducibility of results.
I agree too. Every single time i've done peer reviewing i've done it with all due honesty and specific feedback. It's very frustrating not to receive the same back.
It was posted that selection of the 'I'm unsure about this score' checkbox prevents the review from being counted. Are you using this?
But that could mean all <zipRedac>0000 women demanding the drug when it will only change the outcome of a few - 7.5 will still get cancer and <zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>3 won't but of these <zipRedac><zipRedac><zipRedac>85 were never going to suffer. Telling a woman that only <zipRedac>5 in <zipRedac>0000 will get breast cancer should be explained in a way that makes it clear that each individual's risk of disease is very low (and other risk factors determine whether preventative treatment is suitable)
"There is no verification scheme being run by Stanford and, to be honest, I'd think it unlikely that they would ever do so unless they could use an external service provider. Even where a verified certificate is available, similar riders apply to the certificates. The course content and assessments haven't changed. The only difference is that the student has paid for the privilege of verifying their identity."
Once generated you will find a link against the course on the Stanford OpenEdX dashboard.
"There were only two questions in the final which caused me issues and, even after reviewing the lectures and my notes I couldn't get any better than 50/50. Luckily enough that worked out fine--I got one right and one wrong giving me 100% for the exam."
I finally got some *excellent* feedback on my rewrite for the essay 3 submission!!! 
"Agree! And also dislike the \imploring-thing\"" about grades--So non-academic attitude!"
"\So close, so far\"", someone well-said the other day."
I agree completely!
When will we get the statement of accomplishment? The criteria for the statement of distinction has changed to above 85?
Thanks for the link! Very useful for my students!
I totally fought to get 91. there should not be cut off period.
"I need a reference manager software which is free, uses Vancouver format of referencing and is easy to use. Any suggestions? "
I too wish the same as Karenk
"same happened with me, revised version was graded as point 6 whereas the first one was graded as 12"
I would like to thank you too Kristin. This is my first MOOC and thought it was great! Learned a lot and would take it again. I hope to communicate with you again about this or other Science Writing courses. 
"Thank you Prof. <redacted>, and your team, for a wonderful course and a great MOOC experience."
where did you download your certificate? I see no link!
Very well said
Final Score -> 93% ! 
1 point is not enough for the Statement with distinction (( just 89 points(((. Is it still possible to improve the result somehow?
"Hello, "
"Hi everybody, I had the same problem. 1 reviewer gave me a 15/15 and another 0s for clarity and concision with lots of subjective comments that are surely not correct. Obviously there is a problem here, either on the reviewer side or the system side. I loved this course but this situation leaves me a sad feeling."
Yes I  remembrer it well it was 90% from the start but... when and how we will get the statement? by email or what?
You can try out read cube
very true.... its human nature!!
"Would you have asked the same of your formal examination system at school, college or university just because you are a couple of percent below the 'A' grade point? ... and if you did would they have taken any notice? I'm sure the answer would be 'no', because the grading structure was clearly defined at the outset so should remain the same."
That does not change the fact that you should edit a document before re-submitting it
"I know it is frustrating to narrowly miss a distinction, but everyone was a victim of unfair reviews."
Congrats!! :) -T
"related to this real feedback,"
Hi 
"Beatrice, thank you very much."
"I'm rather grateful to Prof. <redacted> and all the staff for this excellent enjoyable course, too"
"This is the difference between paying for education and getting it for free.  If you want a lecturer to mark your work, you need to enrol in a paid-for course.  There is no way you can expect getting graded by a lecturer in a MOOC."
"Dear Prof. <redacted>, dear staff!"
Class Central has a list of MOOCS at https://www.class-central.com
"I think that main problem is 50% for peers, because it's too much for this unpredictable scores. It will be great to cut off, dont know, may be to 30-40%. Very many persons here have trouble exactly with it. I have 89%,  of course, I will be happy, but Im not sure that is fair."
Thanks a lot for your reply.
"Taiko , thanks for your suggestions. I hope it will improve the peer review system as a whole."
yes :(
The criteria for the statement of distinction has changed to above 85?
"Romeo, "
Are they exactly the same? It could be that the server still has to update and you are just seeing your old results. In my case it also took a while before I saw my new gradings and comments.
Do only people with distinction get the statement of accomplishment?
hi
"No, everyone with 60% and above scores would get the statement of accomplishment"
"I know something is supposed to flash up when it goes to fetch a paper, and I think it might be, but too fast to see.  And I have completely lost count..."
Holy cow! I just found this...
No. I hope not.
No
"Unfortunately that's how it goes when grades are decided, some will be just under and others just over but that's no reason to change the grade values as enough complaints or requests to lower the value would mean you would end up with all participants getting distinctions"
Really great links. Thanks for sharing these links BeatriceM.
I missed for homework 1 and my final grade was affected :( I got great scores in everything otherwise. bummer! Still a great course!
No. Why should they? -T
"It's a technical glitch!!! I am sorry it happened to you :( email the class support, I noticed that while grading my papers, I graded the numbers, and then after commenting I looked back up and everything was zero! so I had to regrade everything."
"Hi everyone and staff,"
"First - if this course wasn't for free, I'd pay for it as did for another courses of interest. "
"Also one more thing to the staff, if you do take this suggestion, please send an email notifying, because that's part of why I missed the homework 1 extension! I never got a notification email and when I checked in the course again, the second deadline had already passed!"
You can erase these fields on Mendeley...so it doesn't appear in citation.
"Hi,"
"I did the same as you and got graded.  I have to say, I never noticed anything about needing a 5% change and doubt I did that; but then it is easy to miss things with this horrible forum implementation."
Happened to people with essay 2 also.  I guess they didn't fix it :(
"I think I learnt a lot by doing the course and am glad they offered it, purely from a gaining skill perspective.  I agree, a course like this would be much better \live\"", but I don't have the money for that.  This was the best option and never mind the marks (though I agree, real feedback - which I occasionally got - and a second pair of eyes on the early exercises would have been helpful)."""
I've had to grade every paper I reviewed for essay 3 twice.  At least I caught them.  I hope.
"Thanks, Susannah, for that note--small impressions like this are easier to share than in a real class room, so that maybe something MOOCs can capitalise on."
"This book -based on the work of William Strunk Jr- is available for free once you install  \Inkling\"" application. "
"One of my graders gave me 1 point for each section and it is clearly unjustified... And my other graders didn't give me fair grades either. This last essay was an improvement of my second one, yet I have a worse grade in this one. Can my last essay be reviewed by a member of staff? If not, please ensure this does not happen in the course's next session as it is extremely frustrating to receive an unjustified bad grade. Even more so when the peer-reviewed essays count for 50% of the final grade."
"Guys it is a pity that this forum is so overwhelming :( I hardly have time or energy to browse through all the threads. However I recognise something similar to my comment in what Diana said, and I am sure I have graded you 15! If it was me - it must have been technical glitch - there was one review where the system did not let me even finish writing my comment and already communicated it was done."
"You are very welcome! A few minutes here and there to help others takes little effort, but gives much satisfaction. You are the ones who have to do the real work in learning. :)"
Hi I also have the same problem. I decided to redo my assignment 1 although it will not make any large difference in my overall grade but I thought it would benefit me regardless. I just had a look at my peer reviews and was really angry to see one reviewer has given me 0 in all sections except one? Another reviewer has given me 0 in the first section and then another reviewer has given me full marks?I have gotten between 12/15 in the first round so I know it cant be that bad. Can someone please review this?As clearly there has to be a problem.
When?
85 is a B and B grade has never been a distinction !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That is so generous!  Thank you.
"I echo the same feedback and agree that this course was a great experience to me as well. I learned a lot listening to the course, doing the assignments/homework's, going through bunch of manuscripts to select for essay assignment and conducting peer reviews. I immensely enjoyed reading through all the essays during peer review process that were mostly on topics not related to my field at all. It was a great learning experience."
I also had this problem.
"Elfatih, Thank you! :)"
I know I was hoping for a distinction too :( 
"I too am a victim of this problem with the peer reviews. Hopefully the technology wizards will figure out a solution.  Other than that, the course was valuable.  I am happy with a certificate of completion."
Agree to. After all it is an academic course.
"The peer review system does need some tweeking. Discussion contributers have commented on many of the problems. A major issue I had was that the 0-3 grades were too restrictive. The contrasts between the various grade descriptors were too great thus not allowing shades of grey.  Either broaden the grade scale, say 0 - 5 or allow reveiwers to put in a number that best describes the general feel e.g 1.5 if you felt that it was better than 1 but not as good as a 2."
"Hello Kristin,"
Great technical output and dedication.
"Hello, "
"It sounds as if you're saying that the \5\"" score was not valid or not competently graded. If so, then the same can be said about your \""15\"" grade and judging by the grammar in your posts, that sounds like someone was just handing out threes as opposed to thoughtfully grading your paper. "
"I'd like to thank professor <redacted> <redacted> too! I loved the course, and now I feel how the process of writing is much easier and more enjoyable for me! Thank you"
"Sigh, I still blame peer reviews for that one.  I wonder what they would find if they considered how many points people lost from peer reviews."
This!  This!  So much this.
I would say lower the value of the peer reviewed essays.  We've all seen how badly the system was handled.
"I am in the same boat, 88%"
"Same here. Two of the three reviewers gave 1 point in all sections and the last reviewer gave 2 points in all sections. No one provided even one comment inside the text. This just indicates to me that they either didn't even try to understand the text or didn't read it all. In the original assignment, for the earlier version I got 14 out of 15 points, and all three previous reviewers gave constructive comments/corrections inside the text."
Had the same problem. Got a very low grade as compared to the previous essay. Reviewer comment was illogical. Very unfair indeed!
Exactly my point. Peer review grading should have been lowered.
Would have been great if the peer review score lowered to 30% whereas Final scores increased by 20% and the final questions made more challenging.
Look through the discussions the answer has been posted many times
It has been extensively posted that changes to grades are occurring without the reviewer's knowledge. This is far more likely than any malicious act. You must also have read than only the median result is used so a single low result has no effect on the final grade.
"Peer grading is unfair.  I got 88,7 % and the peers did no honest peer grading. Change something!"
I also found that the peer grading is not done fairly. I have been graded 11/15 and 10/15 for the writing assignment2. I think peers are not using the learning to grade system properly.
I do hope you gave a link to the free full text version if you expected your reviewer to read the entire original work.
You can always repeat the course next time it's on.
Congratulations
Thanks a lot BeatriceM

"Who is \Prof. Sunni\""?"
Congrats!! :) -T
...ESPECIALLY with the 50% score relying on the easily-manipulated grading system.
"Dear Dr Kristin, thank you so much for providing us with an opportunity so valuable. I appreciate the help and effort you and the team at the Stanford university put it."
It's been not only on Your Essays. This happened to me too. 
...is lots of good reading. :-)
You mean those who did really well in getting 88 or 89% but just 'want' a distinction? This course isn't about academic achievement its about learning by participation - yes there have been problems but we've all gone though EXACTLY the same system where a distinction was defined as 90% and above from the outset. We aren't hearing those in the high 50s pleading for the bar of 60% to be lowered so they can have a certificate
"Hello,"
"Agashi,"
"OK, so I have a similar probelem. My scores for Essay 3 are:"
"Hi,"
"I believe grades, in the end, does not matter. If we learn what we meant to throught this course, I believe, we all have secured the distinction. Peer review system, however, should see some changes. All the best everyone. :)"
"I submitted a revised essay for the 3rd writing assignment, taking in all the advice I was given in the first submission from my peers. The result was that I scored even lower than the first time."
I had a similar thing had to me. I submitted a revised summary of a research paper and someone commented on how I hadn't 'worded the summary like a full length research/journal paper using all the technique we were supposed to use for research/journal papers in class.'
"Hello,"
"For my Writing Assignment 3, Grader 1 marked 2+2+2+3+3= 12/15; Grader 3 marked 3+3+3+3+3= 15/15. But the grader 2 has marked 0. How is this justified? If someone doesn't want to review, (s)he shouldn't give 0 marks. So unfair!!"
I completed my course work and received 88% although my final mark is rounded off to 85%. Shouldn't it be rounded off to 90%? Is everything below 90% rounded down to 85%?
"Many of us were frustrated with the randomly assigned peer reviews we received. But, let's not let chance control our destiny!"
Thank you!!
"I think the same, please!! Was a great course :D"
agree with you~
"It's unfortunate that your score didn't go up, but I hope you learned a lot in revising the essay. Fortunately, the lower grade will not be counted."
Is there any way I can still take part in the grading process? Kept on re-writing and missed the deadline!
"I think it would be unfair. The score was set from the very beginnig. There will always be somebody who misses it by a %. If you lowered it to 85%, than those who got 84% would be dissapointed. There is alway a boarder. I know it is dissapointing to be right behind it. Like the fourth place at the Olympics."
"I downloaded the videos, so that I can refer them when necessary."
"I only saw a checkbox of: \Click here if you are sure about this score\"". I didn't see the other. I always clicked in it."""
Ask yourself! Does your question in any way understand what I pointed out previously?
"If you make it top 20% and a person with 79% comes up, what have you gotto say?"
"That's the one, it stops your review from being counted and shouldn't be used"
"I made the same mistake when my browser messed up at least two of my final's answers. I have an 88% overall grade, but I feel like I deserve the distinction. Anyway to improve our grades after all it's set and done, like extra credit questions?"
"Whatever the technical issues be, I think we should accept 90% as the cut off. All those who scored above 90% also went through the same peer review system; as simple as that."
"Hi Sudarshan, Great that you're trying to give advice on how to avoid the peer review glitch, and that it worked out for you so well."
The same story here. I re-submitted my 1st assessment with a couple of sentences improved (i.e. with some clutter cut) but received only 80% instead of the initial 87% - and without any actual explanations and/or corrections (while the 1st time around there were some).
I did a fantastic course about Spanish pronunciation via https://www.canvas.net/
The peer grading was just unfair though. Someone recieved free points and someone does not recieve any feedback.

"Dear <redacted> <redacted> and all the people who made this course possible,"
"Do you think that 3 for each paragraph is not enough? If the number of the passage for more peers is higher, say 7, then we can have more a fairer mark and a higher chance to get some constructive peer feedbacks. In fact, in the last year Coursera platform, I also proposed that 3 for each peer assignment is not enough, 7 is more appropriate choice and for each peer, we have to give 5 feedbacks."
"I liked the course as well. It was a great learning experience. Thanks to all  - Prof. <redacted>, Stanford U staff and members and all the students who made this course a worthwhile experience."
"Hi Tech Support,"

missed distinction by 1% !!. punctuation mistakes in quiz-sad
"my overall final is 89.3.. I feel i was unfairly graded by peer system, i made all d corrections told to me but still  i was utterly dissapointed by peer attitude towards fair grading."
i got 89.3 %
i finally got 89.3%.. now any chance of distinction certificate.??

This course had so much flexibility few other MOOCs (of reputed universities) offer: 
What were all the review scores?
"I got 88% also, and I missed other grades because I submit 2nd homework late as I was confused about the deadtime"
"You were lucky <redacted> :) and may be you got through reviewer like us, who even after giving suggestions to improve the essay gave a score between 13-15 depending upon the scope of improvement. But in turn got reviewers who did not bother to read essay, gave a score of 10 without even reading or providing any inputs to improve the essay. Assignment 3 saw worse reviewers who just gave 5 or 6 to essays without providing any comments. This was really unfair at their part."
"some minutes ago I was to review the text of the 3 Assignment - alas,"
many thanks for useful tips
I feel my lunch breaks disappearing more or less permanently ;)
But we all went through exactly the same system (admittedly not the same reviewers) but those who were really affected by the 'glitches' will be much closer to 50% (low scores on all essays) and may not even get a Certificate of Accomplishment - I don't see lots of complaints from them. Everyone who is close to 90% should remember that they have done really well regardless of whether they think their scores were fair or not.
but you did really well to get 89.3% Zebabaqtiyar - if you were saying I got 59.3% and I won't get a certificate of accomplishment because all my essay scores were low I might be more inclined to agree (by the way I haven't seen a single complaint about this) but you must have achieved around 40% in the essays which means that neither score was really badly affected and probably reflects a realistic grade (even if you consider your work better)
"Hi, <redacted>."
hmmm...Deadlines were already extended once...so why is it unfair now and not unfair then?
"I'm, too"
"I too overlooked Nov 19th essay 3 deadline thinking it was Nov 22nd.  Really sad because I wound up with 89.3%...think I could've gotten 0.7 point increase in essay grade with revision.  Maybe my 21 pts on final can all be counted?  8-(  Regardless, enlightening course, wonderful learned staff and thoroughly enjoyable experience."
The other Stanford MOOC platform (novoed) has a nice implementation. It shows how many days/hours are left for the deadline. This would be same for all participants anywhere in the world!
"Well, it's no longer offered."
For how long??
"but the peer reviewers were different - some kind of lottery - would you meet the \multidisciplinary reviewer\"" or not. Such reviewing system  act  as  \""Russian roulette\"" (in some sense)."""
"While I don't disagree this would mean we had to do more reviews too - with the current 3 reviews per paper we have to do 4 for each submission, would you be willing/able to do 8 or 10, and to do them all properly? I guess a balance between what is necessary and what is reasonable has to be reached. "
Everyone who is in the high 80's must have got almost 40% on their essay component - how have they been affected by unfair reviews? I suspect they just think their work is better than the reviewers did.
"Dear Taiko, and All,"
Same experience here. Peers are simply giving 0 for no reason and without any feedback where in the same section I have received 3s and 2s from other peers. Completely unfair.
Precisely!
"I was equally impressed by this course. I enjoyed every topic and learned a lot. Thank you very much, you improved my writing skills. I look forward to other future courses. I also appreciate my peers for reviewing my submissions, thank you."
meaning that if you get 88/89% you must have close to 40% from that component of the course!
You'll never change everyone's attitude. No use thinking about it extensively -- it's his/her life.
I just missed the due date.Because I am busy with some academic matters. Any option for re submission of essay in any way.I am very sad.Because I got bad mark for essay 3.Please help me to re submission of essay 3. If it is not allowed it will affect my grade.
"Hello everybody,"
I've got also 89%! Only 1% to distinction!
"Same here Mey,"
This is great! Downloading is certainly an option but I like to view these from devices other than my school laptop. Knowing that these will here for a long time certainly helps a lot.
"I have also really appreciated everything in this course. I feel that I have learned a lot, even without having the time to do the essays."
"I would like to add my thanks to Dr. Sainini, Raj, and all the people working behind the scenes for a great course. I truly enjoyed it and learned a lot. "
you can always retake the course...
"Many thanks, that's helpful."
Same here!

Dear Stanford staff!
Thanks Micahel. That was very helpful info.
"How does one get a review for an answer that was marked wrong only to change it and have it appear as the correct answer? This just happened to me with Quiz #8. There were two questions. I got my first attempt at #1 incorrect, waited a few days then returned tonight and changed it to another; also was given a red x. Lo and behold when I checked the answer it was the first answer that I'd given. Kristin, please help! I really feel badly about this."
Thanks BeatriceM for posting the message here. I would have missed checking my email... that tells how glued was i to the course rather than my mailbox :p)
"Hello,"
Same for me : )
Does anyone know if they mail the certificates or if they're only available to download?
Hi Kristin. What happens when a correct answer is marked incorrect? This happened to me in Module 8. Can this be adjusted? Would be grateful for your feedback.
Reposting:
"89.5 will be rounded up to 90, so you got a distinction!"
Thank you Dr. Kristin and team members for the wonderful course. I learnt a lot form this course.
I just checked back on my assignment 2 as there was an exclamation mark by the 'assessment pannel'.
The course staff sent an e-mail and they said that the certificates will be available to download from the dashboard page on december 2nd. Cheers!

did you grade other people's essays yourself? 
I don't understand why you are so concerned - the progress tab shows 90% so that is your score

"Hello,"
Since i pass the deadline for grading for assignment #2 I could not see my grading/editing for assignment #2. Would that be a possibility to grade more work from 4 colleagues and try to get my grading from assignment #2? 
I have the submitted the essay 3 and I have not received yet the grading ???
You might be okay anyway- have a look at the progress tab and see what your final score is.
I would like to thank Prof. <redacted> and all the Stanford staff who made this course possible. A really nice opportunity to upgrade my writing skills indeed. And very friendly to those who are not native English speakers and/or medical students. Thank you very much once again.
The score that matters is the rounded score that is shown on the Progress tab. If you get 89.5% this rounds to 90% and qualifies you for the 'distinction' grading as Kristin has already confirmed in a number of posts.
Dear Kirstin
I agree too and need the solution to this it affects the overall score in a very bad manner.
"The certificates aren't bad looking. They are obviously based on the edX design (if you have taken any courses there) and although they have \Stanford Online\"" at the top, the instructor is identified as being a Professor at Stanford University."
I second your thought!! I hope the course moderators are hearing us. There was a huge chunk of the class that was aggrieved due to the time issues and the confusion with respect to the first few homeworks. I would hope that they take this into consideration!

Imagine how many junior researches will benefit from this course to move science forward!! I am sure I have thousands of classmates who share me the same opinion. I am glad I passed with distinction (97%), but I do believe that the valuable knowledge I gained throughout this course is much worth than just a score. For those who are frustrated with the peer review (I do agree it¡¯s sometimes unfair and unprofessional), try looking at the big picture! This course reshaped my way of thinking and breached the fear I had towards scientific writing. I feel more confident now reading and criticizing a paper."

I bought it in the beginning of the course
<redacted>:D LOL
Kindly help. Its 3rd Dec and I can't see any certificates in our account. Waiting for a response regarding the same from the course staff.
"I'm from Russia, physicist"
We got an additional email stating to ignore this message as it was intended for the on-campus class.
Do you have any idea about the certificate? I need it urgently.
We certainly have learnt a lot from this course. Keeping in touch and continuing to share ideas would be great. Count me in.
"I didn't get that email, thanks a lot for the info :)"
"Dear Kristin,"
I was aware of an error about my score from the Progress panel. I tried to email the instructor about this error. But my email was rejected back. So I posted on the discussion board. I hope Kristin or the TAs can read my post before they generate my certificate.
How could we get the statement of Accomplishment?

"Another email informed us about an error generating the certificates, so it will be delayed until further notice. The course team is working on fixing the error and will notify us when the certificates are ready."

"Thank you very much, Oblivion2k13..my statement isn't available yet, but I hope I'll get it soon! :)"
I've got it too!
you can down load your certificate now :)
Today you can download you certificate !!!!!!
"If I may add a further comment at this late stage. Kristin has provided figures showing that around a quarter of those who passed the course achieved a 'Distinction' mark. This is surely a reasonable proportion and justifies the figure chosen. As a number of posters have observed, whatever the issues with the peer assessment system, there seem to be no complaints from those who failed even to reach the 'Pass' mark."
"Click on your forum name in the top right corner to go to your home page/ dashboard, the link is in the section relating to this course"

I dont have it!!!
yet

"We've given weekly homework deadlines to mimic a typical off-line class, for students who want to take the course in sync with others. Having weekly homework deadlines motivates students to keep up with the class. However, you don't have to take the course this way. Last year, many students took the course as a self-paced study using the course archives (which will remain available indefinitely). This is also a great way to learn, though you don't get the benefit of working in sync with a group. You can also work ahead of the deadlines if you anticipate having bottlenecks in your schedule."

If we increased our risk by 200%, the risk would be 1%+1%*2.0=3%. Or think in terms of money: If something costs 10 dollars and the price increases to 20 dollars, we have increased by 100% of the original price, not 200%."

First i would ike to thank you for this excellent course
Replace comma with period maybe?
"Yes, in the U.S., we use periods to indicate a decimal point. I think that is likely the error."
"Thank for your help, yes one of the decimal marks was a comma and i didnt notice"

Are there no transcripts available for download (there obviously are transcripts since they are shown to the right) or are the links just missing?
I recommend this BBC article on statistics understanding (or rather lack of it). Very relevant to this course.

that's a good explanation!!
thanks for clearing tht up.I couldnt make much sense of it on the slides
I found this too..I think it was a mistake by the author..it is calculated using 2698 n 2699 which is the actual number in the journal.
Sorry for not looking thoroughly first. I see that an answer to my suggestion was already provided. Thanks.
Waiting for an answer. Thank you !
"Thanks, just wanted to know about rounding off without giving too much :)"
Biggest silly error I made as well! I got the numbers right for unit 2 homework Q10 for the unadjusted risk ratio (91%/29%) but then copied the wrong answer from my notes & missed the 100% for the HW (92%)....lesson learnt....check before you click aka look before you leap!!!!

"Being a runner myself, I'm also interested in this headline! Have you noticed also the many over-sold headlines lately about running too much being bad for the heart? I will take a look at this study later today and get back to you with my thoughts! My suspicion is that running 5 minutes a day is probably not enough to do much, but it's likely that most runners are actually running much more than this! More later..."
"I had similar experience here. I found it helpful to keep going back to the lectures and it appeared that with each repeat, i realize that i had missed one or two useful points at the first viewing. It pays to keep practicing examples on your own as Dr Sainini is working through them and to go through the videos more than once if time permits."

"Basically, the authors found a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality and 45% reduction in heart disease mortality in runners vs. non-runners. This is not surprising. But then they broke runners into quintiles by different running characteristics (such as total time run, speed, and distance run). The Hazard Ratios appeared similar across the different quintiles of running activity. So, they concluded that running a little is just as good as running a lot. The headlines come from the fact that the lowest quintiles included people running <51 min per week (7 minutes per day), <6 miles , and 1 to 2 times per week. There are of course a lot of caveats! (1) When we break data into quintiles, the sample sizes in each quintile are much smaller than the sample size in the overall study. So chance may play a role. (2) People who run 51 minutes per week are probably not running 5-10 minutes per day; they are probably running 1-2 longer runs of several miles. If you are able to run several miles at once, you are probably reasonably fit and may have been running more than this at other times in your life. (3) People who run a small amount may be participating in many other physical activities; though the authors adjusted for this, it was a very crude adjustment. So residual confounding is likely. "

"I'm coming into this class a bit late but will take a stab at answering your question relative to R. If you know, for example, that the distribution of the data is normal and you know the mean and sd then it's easy to generate an associated population. In R, the following will generate <zipRedac>0000 values from a normal distribution with a mean of <zipRedac>0 and sd of 2."

"Yeah, Josh, the same dumb mistake was made by me interpreting the wrong due time for the first hw, and in addition did not see the \quizzes\"" tab on top of the screen until after the first week was over and that is when I noticed a bunch of quizzes due by Sept 1. As a result, got frustrated and gave up as my work responsibilities prevented me from spending xtra time correcting my mistakes. Bottom line here - might be good to focus first session on clarifying procedural matters such as these, otherwise you get a percent drop out as a result - or maybe that is the intention? Anyway, when is the next \""official\"" start of the course - now that I have figured out the technnical/procedures from my mistakes, it would be good to actually do the course?"""

Great question! Thanks for sharing on the forum.

"Although I have great deal of sympathy with the idea of mixed ability teaching, I do feel that before any such system can be introduced, the onerous formal planning, assessment, record-keeping and administrative burdens that most teachers in the UK labour under needs to be reduced first.

Just a suggestion to make the peer feedback process a little more clear: After the peer feedback has been completed, and a student goes to read the feedback submitted by their peers, there is a \respond to feedback\"" option.

Or is the response just going into the system to verify that the process is working? If the response comments are meant for the persons giving the feedback, then they need to know how to access them.

What she did was say that it takes 1 hour to paint 8/15ths of a house or 1hour=8/15House.  But what we want to know is how long does it take to paint the whole house? So you take the equation 1= 8/15H and you isolate H (the whole house) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15/8.  That turns the equation into 15/8  x 1 = 1 x H(the whole house) or 15/8 =H

"I see this shape growing by adding one block up on each column plus adding one column on each side. The difference in cubes grows by odd numbers (5,7,9,11,13...). That means, in case 2 there are 9 cubes and in case 1 there are 4 cubes, so 9-4=5. Case 3 has 16 cubes and case 2 has 9, so 16-9=7. We take the number of cubes on case 3 (16), add the next odd number in the pattern (16+9) and it should give us the number of cubes for case 4 (16+9=25). According to my own thinking, case 100 = case 99 + 105. And I am stuck here!"

I started out so optimistic about this new way of teaching math and have recommended it to every teacher I know, but I'm just frustrated now that my mind is so BLANK when it comes to picturing a formula or extrapolating a concept.  What I want to know is if there is hope for students like me."

"I would agree.  I have been in many a teacher conference where the instructor actually states that some students just have trouble with math overall, and probably should be emphasizing some other interest area!  Kids who do well in math hear that kind of mindset and often wonder why they should \work at all\"" at math if everyone will just give them the easy pass, that's o.k., math is hard for most people.  I try to give many examples of how math is part of every thing they do every day - how it fits into design, into TV programming, into bike route finding, into app development -- anything to spark their interest and perhaps persistence to buck the trend to stay away from math, and gasp! even worse, don't excel at it ~ why bother?! sigh."""
I was wondering where we can find the survey. I'm interested in taking it.
I am submitting after each video as well but I am not sure where the answers are going it is frustrating is there anyone that can assist me ?
"I am curious as how PBL feeds back to students and parents to show that progress is being made. Would it be in levels, grades (which is the common currency outside of the classroom)? What is the monitoring of students, teachers, departments and schools? OFSTED (UK Government tool to monitor and grade schools)??"
I think someone just clicked the wrong radio button?
I was getting concerned as well.  That ETA of 3 days has been there forever.  It should say that we have completed if we submitted and assessed at least our 3.  Has there been a response yet?
My sections are gone as well!  It only shows sections 1-4 which is disappointing. :(
"I find that grouping in math is based on who needs help with a particular concept we are working on.  I can pull a group of students that is in need of a little extra help on that concept. When we have made progress and understand that concept, the group is dissolved. It isn't a fixed group.  The next group will be students who need help with a different concept.  There are a couple of students who struggle who end up in almost every concept group.  They aren't always with the same kids so I don't feel like it is so negative and labeling them as the low group."
my problem too! same problem with 6.4
"Hi Sef,"
"Based on my own experience with mathematics, I am not surprised by these comments. I fear that things have not shifted that much! Recently my 10 year old nephew asked me who the smartest child in my class was. I asked him to define smart. He said you know the kids with photographic memories, the ones that always get the math answers right away, the ones that get to show their work on the SMART board."
"While I understand the drawbacks to grouping,  I am struggling to see an alternative.  In the third grade classes that I support, there is the full gamut of abilities.  The \high\"" students will get bored as the teacher teaches to the middle and low students.  If the teacher did not group, then I don't see how she would have the time to give each student the attention and instruction that they needed. At our school we have committed to a math curriculum and our administration expects the teachers to use it with fidelity.  I am not sure how much leeway the teachers have to modify the lessons to incorporate a more open-ended approach."""

"Hi My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>.  I am moving to 7th and 8th grade resource Math from science and social studies.

"I was a victim of hearing I wasn't good at any kind of math. As a teacher in 4th and 6th grade over the years I have seen many students that struggled with algebra but understood geometry, at the time I believed it was true."
"I had a question early on in the course, which I would still be interested to hear your answer to. I completely agree about the importance of cultivating a growth mindset, and that a fixed mindset can be very damaging and stifle attempts at learning. The question that arises for me is around whether there are any limits to brain plasticity and learning, as it applies to maths? Have there been any attempts to identify a genetic component through, for example, twin studies? Is there any such thing as innate ability in this area, and how large a role does this play? Maybe it doesn't matter, in the sense that what we are trying to do as teachers, is to help everyone to reach their full mathematical potential, whatever that may be...?"
"The stereotyping damage is done early on before students get to secondary school. By the time students get to secondary school, they already have this image. Both course content and sitting exams becomes important, but both can still be done through real-life contexts."
I chose those two as well.  I believe that the lack of foundation stems from the teaching methods that expect each student to learn in exactly the same way.
Great points!
I posted comments on the video and there not online ?
"When I went to my progress section, I noticed that even though I think I have completed all the required tasks in each session, I did not getting 100% on sessions 1 and 3.  Does anyone know why this is happening?  I am thinking maybe because these two sessions involved peer feedback which is still in progress?"
"I think this method helps children see that they can learn from mistakes, that they can think of different ideas together and that numbers can be thought of and grouped in different ways.  This is very engaging.  I also love the opportunity to make it a fun group lesson, by discussing and coming up with a solution together."
I think it's interesting to see there are so many ways of solving one problem. 
"At first, the survey didn't seem to load, so I left it and came back to it a few days later.  I managed to load it and complete it almost 24 hours ago, but my progress report still says I haven't.  Was also wondering about the peer reviews.  I've completed those assignments and completed reviewing other people's work, but haven't gotten any peer reviews for my own.  It's been nearly a week now.  Have I done something wrong in submitting these assignments?"
"I find it difficult to be confined to either type of grouping.  I feel like sometimes it is nice to have a group that is all about at the same place, but then it is a large group and when there is need, it is hard to meet all their needs at the same time.  Our district is pushing students to take more advanced level classes, and instead of having them grouped according to their grades, etc, students have the choice of a regular class or an advanced class.  This sometimes becomes frustrating for me because I feel like I am teaching the same things in both classes, and having to try to reach all spectrum in both classes because there are many students that aren't truly ready for advanced work yet.  I do believe that grouping them together often boosts their confidence, and students that are often behavior problems and struggling in a regular math class, often become great achievers in an advanced class because they are pushed.  I find it hard to really say what is right or wrong and am not sure how I can really make any changes."
"So, I teach many levels of math at the Community College and students aren't really grouped according to their ability (as in, anyone who places or works to get to College Algebra will take, essentially the same College Algebra course). However, I remember about a year ago I went to a \teaching in honors\"" workshop (knowing I'll probably never be \""chosen\"" to be an honors professor), where we discussed for several hours what it means to teach an honors course. It was drilled to us that honors doesn't mean \""give students more work\"", rather, we should be using a different approach with them to get them to a higher level of understanding. After leaving that workshop, I was angry. Why are the honors students given a budget for field trips, small class sizes, and the best professors who are actively encouraged to find ways to try new innovative methods that entice students to reach the higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy (or whatever learning hierarchy you subscribe to)? I feel like we've given up on all but the highest level students, never giving the \""bottom\"" 95% of students a chance to achieve that highest level."
I have completed tasks 2&3 but they do not show as being 100% complete.
"Yes, the (multiple) errors in this video's CC were pretty egregious."
I answered two questions in Session 7. Progress section but did not see anything. I mean the graphics. Does anyone know why? In other sessions not happened.
Where can we download the one page document that Jo says she wrote for us in this video? I think the link was missing.
I have the same problem with the survey - I'm trying not to let it worry me.        I still have 0/1 for random assessments and I can't see why as they're all completed. Oh well!
"I fully understand the problems of 'limiting' learning in ability groups.  I even get that differentiating instruction promotes learning to all levels.....however, what I don't get is how to have different levels in a peer grouping situation to discuss and problem solve math."
"You said session 8 would be posted today, so I pulled myself out of the wilds to get it completed at an internet cafe, but it is not here!  Now I won't be finished before the beginning of school.  Big Sigh"
Still no feedback from peer review on 2 of 3 submissions.  Is this working?
We seem to have made a mess of math education. Presumably the old curriculum was designed by experts at great expense. How did we get it so wrong? How confident can we be that 'this time' we are getting it right?
"Hello: I was wondering if participating in the Discussion sections beneath each video are mandatory as part of the course tasks, or if by just clicking on the arrow after each video and answering the questions posed it is sufficient for task completion.  Thanks!"
Where is the survey? Thanks
I cannot write my reply in the dialog box I need your help
Wow! I was just beginning to write when I decided to read the other responses first! There are some serious amazing people on this board and I am in awe that so many-from so many different backgrounds can come together and share amazingly similar viewpoints! 
I loved how they described math as a place where you are free. Conventional math instruction is often horribly rigid.  I'd love to help my students get that sense of freedom.
"Both have challenges.  No matter what grouping structure there is in place there will be students who feel less capable than their peers. Sometimes it's worse for students to feel like the least capable student in a high functioning setting.  Totally mixed grouping is fraught with the same issues.  I'm fortunate, next year our district is doing away with ability grouping in 8th grade math.  I'm nervous, I must admit.  However, I'm staying open and know that I can make it work.  It will take effort.  It will take a different set of teaching strategies.  Using a variety of student grouping structures within the class will help.  I know that to make a successful transition, students aren't the only people who'll need to have a growth mind set.  We want our students to feel positive about themselves and their efforts, but if teachers don't believe in our hearts that we can grow and learn with effort and mistakes then the messages we send tell our students are hollow."
You hit the nail on the head... good job.
"I think that these problems are difficult because when we are faced with so many words our brain shut down and we lose our common sense.  With the house problem, in a real world situation, wouldn't you just round to 2 hours?  That's what I did."
"I watched as the answers unfolded, and I saw a couple of things: the turkey problem was a no-brainer for me. I solved it the way the first child did- but I loved the way the second child thought about the problem. The simplicity of the image took my breath away. I want to remember to do it that way, as well as the first way."
Which article were you thinking of using?
"Using dots gives another dimension to numbers, the spatial dimension. I have students who do not do well with numbers but they are fascinating when they are given a geometry problem to do. The special component adds one more dimension to thinking about numbers and seeing the same number in a variety of ways or shapes."
My session 2 work is now showing 100% completed (thank you) but I'm still not complete for session 1. It may be related to the Peer Feedback questions waiting to be scored.
Look at the classroom itself - are there historical posters of female mathemticians and are there careers posters of females using mathematics?
What I loved about it was there were many strategies shared and and then talked about.  When I am thinking of my 3rd graders this is great because many of them solve their problem a different way and then it validates to them that the way they did it is correct and we all don't solve problems the same way.  I also liked how talked about similarities between problems.  Great number talk
how does differentiation fit into this picture then?
I am using Firefox.   When I open a link to an article the article prints in two fonts; one on top of the other making it very difficult to read. Is there anything I can do to get it clear?  It has happened on several articles.

When I get things wrong in math I got so frustrated!
Anyone know where Session 8 is? It's Tuesday.
"I have submitted question 1.3B over 10 days ago and it's still waiting to be graded, I also submitted questions 1.6, 3.2 and 4.5 quite a while ago and they are still waiting to be graded. However, the last one I submitted, was question 4.9 and it is already graded and finished. Can someone advise what could be the problem, or is there something that i might have done wrong? Appreciate your feedback"
"Hi from Redlands,California."
"Yes - I like that idea. It's not the answer that's so important, but how you saw it. Maybe with your children you can see who can think of the most ways of getting the answer. We will all strengthen our knowledge of numbers by working in this way."
I had the same issue. Am I bad at finding the check button and bad at math???
"Hi, "
I can't click into the response box. Can anybody advise please? Thanks in advance!
I'm not a teacher so don't understand all the difficulties of teaching. Perhaps students excel more when they have the chance to collaborate or work on projects together on problems that are bigger. Can the focus in classrooms move to a project basis?
It was really nice to hear those boys talk enthusiastic of math. It seems to be a rare mood in Denmark.
"too many students are passed by when they don't understand a concept and the rest of the class must continue to the next lesson.  This causes a lack of foundational knowledge, but is caused by teaching methods - A"
I love to hear more about research with twins.  We have so many now.  Should they be together or not?  Some parents pressure for the same teacher so they have the same homework.  Others want the twins in separate classes.  Very interesting subject.
"So earlier in the course, the PBL class never took \tests\"" but performed better.  And now students are being assessed often and performing better.  Is there a difference between tests and assessments?"""
I like this!
"As a trainee teacher I still have an open mind on this.  I read about how mixed ability teaching is better, but when I go in to secondary schools, teachers tell me that they have pupils who can't tell the time alongside pupils who can do long division.  So they set for maths.  Maybe some intervention would be better than setting.  One big problem with setting is that it is rarely reviewed and becomes hard to move pupils between classes.  My own daughter says she enjoys being in the second maths set because the pace of work suits her.  She can do the work but needs more time.  Setting in primary schools is hard to justify but does happen in the UK - possibly because schools are assessed based on exam results, and this seems a chance to boost results???"
Quite a few of my submissions aren't showing up. Am I doing something wrong?
Or the teacher who thinks if they just repeat the same thing over again but slowly while enunciating that this will help.  Implies the student is slow to understand.
It is helpful to see the other ways that people look at the same problems. Something as simple as counting ten dots can be viewed in so many ways and this teaches us to keep an open mind and always look for other ways to solve problems.
"I see the pattern as \plus 3\"" as each new shape has three additional cubes.  I couldn't see the pattern at first and had to make and look at a chart for quite a while then discovered 3x-2.  So, 100 would be 298 - I hope!"""
"At my school last year we had mixed group classes with one \accelerated\"" class.  The idea was that there would be no lower level class, so no one would feel like they were bad at math, but the problem was that 75% of the students thought of themselves as \""not smart.\""  (Not really, but it seemed like that some days, despite my attempts to discuss the idea of growth mindset, and the fact that there were 4 or 5 students who got accelerated on the MCAS for math in each of the 3 non-accelerated classes.)"
"Many students hear from family members that they were never good at Math, Math is hard, etc. so students feel it's acceptable not to worry about Math in school."
"Hope ,with the nice intro,everything will go on smoothly and easily in learning the \beauty\"" of math."""
finished the course but never did get recognized for doing the 5.5 submission - lost in cyberspace since not listed as needing peer review either  :(
"My students ask all the time when they are going to use algebra in real life, especially since now there are GPS devices and calculators and computers that \can do it for them.\"""""
"yes, I agree.  Students need to look at math with new eyes."
"I would get super excited about mistakes in class.  Give students high fives and praise, ask how they came up with the answer, get some dialog going.  I have done this over the past few years and it works great."
I think often times students won't even start a conversation about a math problem if they think initially that they don't know how to get the right answer.
"I loved how many times they said that they loved math class because they felt \free.\"" And it was great to hear how whole-heartedly they accept mistakes as tools for learning!"""
I don't see your poster <redacted>
"What I mean is that in all cases we're really talking about sums and products. A dot card represents an answer and the method for getting there is represented in the methods. Some of the answers were the sum of products, some were sums, and one was even a product. It's great because it also involved spacial senses, there was so many possibilities based on different learning styles. This is AWESOME. I actually started to tear up as I watched and listed, because I recognized the possibilities and the freedom of these methods. BRAVO!"
Hi I'm wondering if anyone else feels they will have difficulty completing the course by September 27th.  If seems as if the Sessions are getting longer.  I've just finished Section 4.  I'm a teacher and school is starting soon and I know I will have a lot less time. 
I am having the same problem. It will be great if someone can help out with this technical difficulty.
"From parents and from other teachers.  A good friend of mine who is an English teacher persists in loudly declaring \I'm too pretty to do maths\"".  I've spoken to her about this and how irresponsible it is and how it's undermining students and her colleagues, but she keeps on doing it.  My own mother still says \""I was never any good at maths\"", and I've heard similar things from lots of parents of my students."""
"I was amazed that they thought of math as \free\"" and that \""you can do whatever you want.\""  I think that many people think of math as the exact opposite of that.  I was also struck by their casual use of the term \""decomposing,\"" a term they seemed as comfortable with as \""addition.\""  I think it's wonderful that they feel comfortable with making mistakes, even in front of the whole class."""
I did all of 5 this morning but there were issues....esp. when I got into 6. It appeared that they did not have things organized correctly. I will be  a bit upset if all I did in 5 is gone!
"I've gotten that error. What I did was everything from clicking on the session, left hand side, to re-launch it to logging out and logging back in. Both have worked so I just keep trying to re-launch the page or the session."
"Generally I hated it because I wanted to do more than 1 problem. It took so long for them to go over solutions, and it could have been done more quickly."
"Interestingly, it's been proven that being bilingual also makes you smarter (more synapses!) sort of like working with multiple representations in math, you see things from different perspectives. The state of Utah (where there happen to live a lot of Mormons, who all spend a couple of years as missionaries in other countries, and thus have to learn another language) has been really concentrating on developing bilingual classes in a large variety of languages, and the results in all subjects has been impressive. (I just did a google search on \bilingual education utah\"" which came up with so many interesting sources, I figured it wouldn't be worthwhile just listing one."""
"Keep it up.  I like the Simile 'peeling away the layers'.  Building trust, opens opportunity to build confidence with personal success."
"I've done session 1 and done all my peer reviews, too, and the progress bar shows I've done 0%.  :("
They were enthusiastic and liked the lesson - I wonder how others in the group felt?  They like a new approache
"I have Wolfram on my ipad and cannot find the graphics that you had on your smart board, can you tell me where it is in Wolfram?"
"I wonder what they say about making mistakes when it is just them.  The question seemed a little leading (I am guilty of this too!  My inflection is my biggest downfall :)) so I wonder if it feels as positive as they are saying.  I could tell Nick has probably done a lot to help the students to be okay with mistakes, but there are still so many parts of students days that are about why mistakes are bad, so I wonder how students negotiate that in their minds."
"This would be the message I'd present with a discussion of how brain synapses are created when we make mistakes, when we challenge ourselves and when we ask questions that we don't know the answer to, and that these brain connections that we are creating  will lead onto bigger and better ideas."
"I liked the concepts that the students felt they were free to do what they wanted, they said it was really cool and I hadn't thought about the label \friendly numbers\"" before"""
I do have the same problem:(
"I have tried to access it using Chrome and Firefox, and neither seem to work.  Can someone do a screen shot or something so I can see what it is?  Thanks."
I have had the same problem. I sent a report to tech support.
"I have done all of the work, with the exception of one question in the first session.  Can you tell me why the Peer Review question has not been graded yet?  This is holding me below 85%.  Also, I don't think the one question I have chosen not to answer should keep me below 85%.  Is that true?"
Do many school/state boards in fact tie teacher financial incentive to test scores? I am not aware of this in Ontario.
"I had problems posting mine, too!  I tried several times and it said that I could only do it once, but I couldn't see my response at all!"
This has happened to me as well.  There doesn't seem to be any way to go back in peer review.
I wonder if this statement could be improved by including what the numerator and denominator represent? I'm not sure. This is all fairly new to me.
"If you don't mind, can you share what is making you re-examine your beliefs. I am a department head and a few of my co-workers have a very fixed mindset. I am trying to think of some activities we can do that help them to re-examine their beliefs. They won't do this course. Any suggestions?"
"Maybe I have a poor memory, but I thought that yesterday under the heading of peer evaluation one could evaluate another or look for their evaluations (seeing what others have said). I don't know where that has gone to. How do I find out what others have said about my peer review problems I have submitted?"
"The maths lessons in which I haven't grouped my children are the ones that are the most exciting with the most obvious learning, enjoyment and development of true understanding.  However, while I know all the evidence makes ability grouping wrong and damaging, I still find it hard let go of my worry about the engagement and learning of my least successful children, the two or three who find it very hard to collaborate and sustain concentration.  Do you engineer who they work with?  How do you support them?"
I don't see the link. Where it is?
"I completed the self assessment and session one, but it is showing that I have not done anything on the \progress\"" section.  It also deleted all that I submitted."""
I've been getting an error on the peer reading page for a week now - would love to help look at others.  Mine have been reviewed now except when the error (freezing) occurred after doing 5.5.  So that glitch has stopped me from going back and helping do more than 3.
"One idea that I tried to show students what persistence looked like was to take a problem and work through it myself using a document camera at the front of the room.  My goal was not to solve the problem, but to show the kids how I approached the problem, what I was thinking as I solved the problem, everything that I said to myself as I solved it, trying different ways to solve it, and going back to check my thinking.  After I shared this, I gave them a problem, and asked them to listen to each other (in their groups)for these things.  We then did a \Think, Pair, Share\"" activity to discuss what each group did and said.  I'd like to think this was helpful, but at the time, I tried it to get the students used to working in groups, listening to each member of the group, and to follow the norms of working in a group.  Any suggestions?"""
Just finished section 3 and questions 3.8 are not showing up.  It says I have not completed them.  I submitted both and did my own review.  Boxes are empty.  I spent significant time answering these two questions.  I hope they have not just disappeared.
"They gain insights into different ways of grouping and organizing sets of objects VISUALLY, which they then (mentally) translate into numbers. I think this is important, and an effective way of teaching, because (perhaps because of the way we evolved as humans) we interpret and respond to the world visually."
I would love to show my students clips from these videos - or give them pieces of some of the NY Times articles she referenced to read.  Perhaps even get the english teachers in on discussing it too.
We do online school.  How can we offer the group collaboration suggested?
"I use video clips to allow students to move on, how do you provide a fast track?"
I like this and may use it--ok?
"Sorry guys, I only just realized I need to grade some first, which I have done now (this is my first time teaching online!)"
Or possibly change to amount of time to paint a room instead of the whole house.
"It took me awhile to realize that until the peer-grading ones are graded, it shows as a 0/1.  "
I'm a parent for kindergarten kid. Could you provide resources to formative assessment for kindergarten.
"I was interested in the app that the class was using - I downloaded Doodle Class Pro, but it doesn't seem to be the one in the video. (The one I've downloaded is a game where the children can throw board rubbers! ) I would appreciate any help in finding the correct app. Thanks"
You're right.  I didn't understand the first question to \use the diagram to show [equation given] until I realized I needed to apply or deduce geometric princples to arrive at an equation which then must be transformed into the equation given.  This exercise was like a hard SAT question and SAT is not about growth mindset.
the concept is not enough scientific rationality and irrationality of transcendence.
"When I go to my peer submissions it shows my 5.5 has been finished for peer grading.  When I click on it to read peer feedback, there is nothing there.  I also do not have credit for it in the Progress section."
"Agreed...I teach 4th grade and once again we are under pressure to get through specific topics \By the end of 4th grade...\"" Is there a resource that anyone has used in the middle elementary grades that provides more ideas or support for crating greater number sense?"""
"Hi,"
I wonder if Jo has any research supporting or disproving this mindset for this subgroup.
I completed all the assessments in Session 1 but it is not reflecting on my dashboard/records. Kindly assist.
Can you please send the link to this TED talk - I couldn't find it on their site?
WHY?
"I am also having this issue.  Task 1 is marked as \done\"" but does not show up in the Progress tab.  Tasks 2 and 3, however, do."""
"Dear professor Jo,"
"I had the same problem. I just realized that the midnight deadline was UTC time which is a world time zone. It is 6 hours ahead of me in Colorado, so mine stopped working right around 6pm. Would be nice if they could do an extension because of the time zone confusion. I finished at 79 percent, but I actually finished all the sessions last night, but it didn't take any of them except for the final surveys."
"I accidentally clicked submit twice when submitting one peer review, and so the system gave two people the same feedback.  Is there any way to fix that?"
I have exactly the same problem as <redacted>. Advice gratefully received!
I have noticed that I have several tasks that still have a 0/1 score.  Is it just because the peer grading is taking so long.  Is there anywhere to get feedback for the items that receive a score of 0?  Just curious if anyone else is having issues with the scoring of their tasks. . . . thanks!
"I just completed session 3 (at least I think I did, not sure where I'm supposed to post the first day messages response) and the progress is showing as 85% but my progress for sessions 1 & 2 is still inaccurate - I completed all of the tasks AND I see them as \submitted\"" but they're not showing up in progress.  I guess the system is growing lots of new synapses?  It looks like I'm in great company and I'm grateful for the information in the course, these technical \""glitches\"" reinforce for me (and I admit, I'm probably one of the older students - I graduated from college in 1980!) why I so prefer classes where I'm face to face with other students and can actually ask and listen to questions and responses using my mouth and ears and not just my eyes and keyboard.  Cheers!"""
Where did the assessment panel go?  Tried all day to get in and it doesn't show anything but general information.
"I am concerned that although I have reviewed quite a few assessments, mine are still waiting for review.  These are from Session 1.  I have continued on and completed Session 2, but still no peer review in session 1.  Should I be concerned?  Thank you!"
"When I tried to grade assessments, I got the error that there were not enough calibration essays. This makes me think that the admins haven't graded enough essays to \teach\"" us how to do the peer assessments yet."""
"I see the puzzles now, but I still don't see the one-page document?"
Hi Sef
"I am having the same problem as well.  It says I've used 1 of 1 submissions, but isn't showing as completed on the progress page."
"I have a challenge understanding intuition in math. How do I \understand something immediately without the need of conscious reasoning\""?"
"I noticed that the feedback on \practice\"" grading usually has very short and sweet input, so as long as it's a \""practice\"" grading, I'm keeping it short.  If it's not real, then..."""
This is definitely a challenging situation. Do your students work online with you? Could you set up something resembling a blog for them to answer these questions over the internet? rm
I missed why Jo is using the word MATHS? Please advise.
"This won't be any comfort to you, but my peer assessments seem to be up-to-date. Only 6.6 missing and that's very recent. Are you sure those numbers are waiting to be graded? I thought they might just be number submitted. Either way, it doesn't help with your problem. Hopefully, technical support will read this."
Same concern! Please clarify. Thank you!
I could not find a formula either
Me too. Have downloaded Google Chrome and completed the survey 4x and it shows blank.  Progress bar says I haven't done it.  Frustrating!
Life is hard--especially when you don't have enough money to pay your bills--so it is better to learn now than later
I would like some advice about how to deal with the different paces of students. Thanks!
I agree. what is something in your class that you have done or will do to promote this?
Do the students still work if they are not in the same level?..or do the strong students take over?
"I figured out 1/4 of the 3 slices, not 1/4 lb. = how many slices. Yikes...."
"I completely relate to the, \But you're Asian, you must be good at math!\"" stereotype.  I was an anomaly to the trend, and while the elementary school years were a breeze and geometry and trigonometry, strangely, were manageable with concerted effort, algebra was beyond me.  My poor math ability really aggravated and confounded my parents."""
"It seems obvious to me that this information about grouping likely applies to subjects outside of math.  As a world language teacher, I feel that fixed mindsets are very prevalent in this subject.  Does anyone know of cross-curricular studies that show the same evidence?"
how do we print the completion certificate?
think of something you love to do - could you do it better if you did well in math?
"Hi,"
What exactly is your district doing that is moving you in the right direction?
I agree.  I'm in the same boat.  Mine have been waiting for review for over a week.  What will be the outcome if the peer does not finish the course and review our work?
Neat ideas.  Is this where we're supposed to find others' poster ideas?
"Jo, another TEACHING STRATEGIES/CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT question:"
I show that I still have pending peer review but it give me an error when I go into it in 4.
I made the same mistake.  Just wasn't thinking.  Also didn't do Jo's 'does your answer make sense?' step.
"I would have hated this as a college student because honestly I just saw a holistic 10. I suppose this a good stepping stone for seeing different methods and parts of wholes, but I was not a big fan of this."
When you spend  your time on the  'basic' facts in lower elementary you get out of practice!  I feel like my students must feel...afraid to step out....
"I am a Teaching Intern. I will graduate with my Masters in Curriculum next year. I am looking forward to being in my own classroom, but I am concerned. I am concerned that I will not be able to teach the way I have been learning to teach. "
"I think what also happens is that by default, Joe can be relied on to answer questions in class, so others start feeling they don't have to or won't be asked to do so.  I know in many classes, there were always those few people who would contribute a lot, whatever the reason, so I definitely felt like I was off the hook."
"a bunch of us are having problems submitting 5.5 - it's not showing up on our list of assignments for peer assessment. Second, we aren't able to get into the peer evaluation. Says there's a technical problem. it's been like that since Monday afternoon. We've posted in the tech support forum, and I've written them directly twice on Tuesday and Wednesday - NOTHING BACK. Can you check into this, please?"
"When I try to review my peer assessments, despite multiple submissions, I am prompted that their are not enough for a rubric?"
"My favorite part of the discussion is when they explained how math is \free\"" instead of being a prisoner of rules.  They totally understood the idea of decomposing numbers and using \""friendly\"" numbers. They really seem to enjoy the class and appreciate what they are learning.  Also, the class clearly has a mistake-friendly culture."""
"I show where the error occured, ask for a correction if they understand what's wrong, & show them the correction (with explanation) otherwise, and get them to finish solving the problem from there."
"I agree! It's not just T-Shirts for girls, though. I hate the gender neutral ones that say things like, \I stopped listening a long time ago!\"" Why parents buy T-Shirts for their children that underscore a negative message is a mystery to me. One time I made a fake T-Shirt slogan and wore it as I greeted my class. I tried to behave as normal, but the message on the shirt was insulting to every reader. The students had quite a reaction to that T-shirt! I followed that experience up by talking about the power of the messages we wear and had the students design their own T-Shirt with a positive message that would build our community up rather than tearing it down. The problem is that the parents did not like me criticizing their choice in clothing their child. So I never did it again, but believe me, I think it's a huge issue!"""
"In working with students who have a history of failure and little confidence in their ability to be successful in math, I would add the word \yet\"" to their comments saying, \""I can't do this\"" or \""I just don't get this.\"""""
I am not sure if I agree with tracking or not.  I like teaching children at all levels.  It seems that If you teach kids at the same level then it becomes the Sam ethnic over and over.  I know if the teacher is getting hired then the kids are too.  In a normal class setting the lower level learners can learn from the higher learners and vice versa.  Although I do find it VERY HARD to find a middle ground.   There has to be an easier way.
"I have some advanced math kids in 8th grade who got a lot out of number talks of multiplication problems.  It is surprising that these kids were too used to the algorithms and didn't know where they came from.  Granted dot cards may seem a little elementary, but they may not realize the connection of associative property without something like this.  Maybe more of a focus on the area diagrams in the last video will really make sense of binomials."
"Using dot cards helps students to see other perspectives for making sense of numbers, how they can be grouped.  The dot cards remind me of the Grapes of Math books which seem to help with visualizing and grouping."
"I think the teaching methods can contribute to a lack of foundational knowledge. If teachers aren't making the math interesting, relevant and engaging for students they will struggle to gain the basic concepts early on and then later this will compound into difficulty with more complex problems."
"Parents seem to reinforce the idea that math is hard and that they never \got it.\"" Comic strips and t.v. shows always portray math as something that only geeks and nerds can do."""
I would focus on explaining to students the importance of making mistakes...what happens in the brain when mistakes are made and how learning from those mistakes affects the brain.  I want to make making mistakes less negative and praise students for their attempts and perseverance.
"As someone with Asperger's, I like to think of there as being multiple types of it.   For example, I think entirely in words, not in pictures - my entire existence is constructed around words.   I can read complex, abstract things, and be able to make sense out of the words.  By contrast, another friend of mine who's autistic thinks mostly in pictures - he can take a computer program with a million lines of code and visualize it.   Each of these different ways of thinking pose their own challenges for math learning - and are things to take into account - but I wouldn't say we're \better\"" at math just for being autistic."""
"I'm sorry, I didn't understand we were supposed to click forward to answer the question! I thought we were supposed to answer in the discussion -- confused!"
Maths messages- who give the negative vibes!
"I see the trauma all the time with the students I teach, the older the student is the more time a students takes to trust the learning environment within my classroom.  I feel like I am peeling away the layers of pain, fear and \I can'ts\"" so I can move these great math learners forward with \""I CAN\"""""
survey link below vvvv
"Explaining what you just heard someone say is invaluable - for building a positive classroom climate to making all learners accountable. I teach fifth grade and it takes a long time for some of my students to learn to reflect on another classmate's response - they always want to jump in and share how they solved something. I do think if you practice this on a regular basis, everyone will benefit."
"I'd like to focus on the last interview - I really like what he said about mathematics being intuitive and his inference to traditional mathematics s being fixed rules and how he would persevere through understanding equations until he understood how it worked - how then the equation/rule/formula became an emotional/intuitive part of him. This, I believe, we as educators can help our students with - So, I can see right now in my class of 6th grade student students as we are constructing area models as we are learning about factors and products and multiples - having the students experience the formula for area (whether it be length x width = area or base x height = area) and how that relates to an area model... how does it work... how does the length and width - these lengths turn into squares, what does that mean, how does that relate to anything ... what does it mean... Can my students explain how two lengths turn into squares and what is the intrinsic value to that."
"This really helps students see many methods for solving one problem, brings in visualizing, and solidifies student thinking by having them talk about what they did"
"I'm going to look for a student (grade 9-11) accessible paper on the brain research and what happens when you make mistakes. I really want my students to see that this is not hokey, but backed with research. Any leads would be greatly appreciated.  I will also have a poster in my class about making mistakes and how important they are.  Lastly, I like the idea about giving examples of people who are viewed as geniuses who made many mistakes, but I'd like this to be relevant to my students' culture and background."
"I am not sure that I was surprised, I believe I was a relieved to see that presenting this method of breaking problems down increased understanding and enjoyment in the subject."
I didn't see or remember a lesson from Japan... how did I miss that????
Felt embarrassed and found it hard to ask for help because it seemed that I too should know how to get the right answer
"I wonder if ignoring those remarks is helpful to eliminating the barriers.  I am feeling like I am somewhat responsible for addressing those remarks to try to reverse the stereotypes.  Having said that, I know that we need to pick and chose our battles and can't address every comment."
That last question stumped me and angered me. It brought back a lot of negative memories trying to solve these kind of puzzles which really aren't that hard when you lay it out the way you did...logically and sensibly. Thank you!
I wonder how I can show kids my own growth mindset more...
"I do believe that in younger age to put kids in ability group will set kids to failure. We need to challenge kids, but in high school, what we can do? If kids have poor basic math skill, how can we help them?"
"Is anyone else feeling a little overwhelmed by the lengths of the sessions?  While I'm learning lots and it's very interesting, it's taking WAY longer than I expected to get through the information."
"I'm not sure your solution has helped. How can I follow a discussion? It seems everyone just does a \new post.\"" That really discourages discussion. Is there some way to encourage people to actually READ what others have written, and then comment on it and add our own input? Stating one's views is helpful for the writer to clarify his/her own thoughts, but that is very different from having a discussion. I think it is possible within the confines of a MOOC, as long as the discussion forum is set up in a suitable way. Ideas? Suggestions? Perhaps I am just missing something."""
"I agree with your reasons of why tracking is bad 100% in theory.  The reality, as a high school teacher, is that students are very jaded when I get them in my classroom.  They are pretty set in their ways.  How do I turn that around?  They've been tracked for at least 3 and possibly more years before I get them.  The other problem is that teenagers are a different breed; they are not necessarily motivated to succeed.  There is so much going on in their lives; school work is very low on their priority list, except for those \Honors\"" kids.   "
"I think it is really hard to give each child differentiated instruction with in a class with out some groupings.  Teachers just don't have the time or resources to do that in most schools.  In an ideal world, not grouping would be wonderful.  I think most teachers work very hard at not labeling kids and giving the many leveled students time to work and socialize together.  From a practical standpoint, it is near impossible not to sometimes group students.  The best I can offer is to constantly revisit each grouping and reevaluate each student, work hard at keeping each and every child challenged and encourage all children."
Several of us have this problem. It matters to me because I'm only showing 50% for Session 2 (and 0% for Session 1 - no idea what I did wrong there.)
"Could you, please, elaborate on \Case n - 2n+1 added - n+1 squared total\""?"""
"Could you describe \i-ready\""? It sounds interesting."""
"I like how she said \Let me rewind for a second.\"" I honestly couldn't tell if she didn't follow the thinking or if she wanted the student to become clearer. There was no judgement, just the need for clarity."""
It is hard for me to make the connection too.
"Will the rubric on risk taking be evaluative or instructive? If it is evaluative (you check what box they in, for example) I can imagine it becoming another point of stress. That could be avoided by really discussing the feedback. An instructive rubric that students use for self evaluation and reflection and perhaps discuss with a peer could be helpful. Thanks for sharing your idea."
I am currently not teaching and am home with my young children.  When I go back into teaching I fear the school I work at will still be doing ability grouping.  This class and especially this session have really opened my eyes to the negative and long lasting effects ability groupings can have.  How do I respectfully offer my opinion on the matter when I am not tenured and have no seniority in the district?  How do you go about teaching in a fashion that you know is doing more harm than good?
"Hi <redacted> <redacted>, I am also from <redacted: [Texas town]>. What grade level are you teaching Geometry in?"
Not an answer but a related question:-
"I've seen STEM on Tpt and pintrest, but I don't know what it is... a little back ground anyone?  "
"How do you have problems where students have to show all their work (like Free Response Questions on the AP test or proofs in geometry)?  I don't have computers for each student in my classroom. Do the students take the tests at home?  If so, what about students who don't have computers at home?  How do you stop cheating?"
By the time students reach my high school class they are quite set in their mindset!  How do we best combat this when it has been so ingrained in them?
Our school is guilty of grouping.
"I have completed all 4 sessions now too, and there seems to be issues still about Progress recording it all correctly.  Hopefully that will be fixed by the time the next set of sessions is released."
"I am unfamiliar with the teminology \fixed or growth mindset\"" - but if I understand it plays in to work ethics.  Too many students think if something is hard, they aren't expected to do it.  As a Math Teacher, I expect if something is hard, you will engage with it.  Students check out, expecting math to be a series of sequences I tell them how to solve, not a process of thinking."
"The students saw the value in the way Nick was teaching them math.  They talked about being able to do better in grade four and how they weren't taught Math this way in grade two.  They saw math as open and friendly.  What is their grade four teacher going to be like?  If this pedagogy is not an expectation at this school, what happen to them as math learners moving forward?"
I'm still waiting for peer reviews on assigments from session one - I'm now on session 4. Is that right?
Perhaps I did not read carefully or hear properly please advise on what to do to get CEUS after finishing the course? I apologize if this question has been answered already.
"I teach in a small school comprised of all split grades.  The teachers struggle to meet the needs of students with a wide range of ability levels in each class.  In my experience, when groups are formed with mixed levels the kids who struggle tend to sit back and rely on the \clever\"" kids to do the work.  When they don't understand and can't keep up they check out.  How do you ensure all students within the group are engaged?"""
"I'm curious what grade level you work with. How will you foster conversation about Mindsets? I'm going to have students write about it, then share their thinking with conversation. I'm hoping for quality interaction. What is your quote? Please share!"
"I want to know how do you reach students who **hate** math?  How do you reach the students who lack the foundational skills and have been moved on to high school and handed a calculator?  These students cannot see the patterns and relationships needed to work on \how the pattern grows\"" or want to participate in those lessons?"""
My posts are not being recorded.  I just want to acknowledge that I am trying to post.
"<redacted>. Hi, could you tell me in which video and at what time you saw this? I'm curious myself. Many thanks."
can you direct me to the survey?
"My question would start from your most important goal: What data support doing something different? Getting intimate with the data requires that you look at the low, middle, and high groups, as well as possibly other factors. Quite simply, if you  currently have a high average with few students with poor math skills, you have to think about elevating student achievement from a model that apparently already works. If student achievement is poor or not so good, then there is much evidence that practices need to be analyzed and reformed."
"Our school district chose 10 schools to be part of a large grant to become demonstration schools around the CCSS.  I teach first grade at one of the schools.  I also feel it is important to have students build a solid understanding of number sense and operations.  I am looking for ways to differentiate, while still working towards the same goals."
"When I went back into the course for the section with peer comments, I was able to see one comment only.  There was a link at the bottom after where my answers were."
I had the same question - I suspect that they got something wrong on that chart....
"Even as an adult education instructor you can see the differing abilities among the students.  We don't ability group per se, but we do have math classes where we only teach Algebra, only Geometry, classes that teach whole numbers, and classes that teach decimals, percents, and fractions.  Students must test high enough in the computation classes in order to be placed into the Algebra or Fast Track classes.  Students are scheduled to classes based on the TABE scores.  Sometimes students may be placed into my algebra class that does not have a basic understanding of multiplication.  This just shows how inaccurate testing can be at times.  It is frustrating as an instructor when I have a room full of students and some are taking off with the assignment and others are struggling to keep up.  Its a fine line that all teachers face and you just have to know your students and do what is best for them to learn."
"I am pretty surprised about the grouping by ability will hinder the students. However, I am curious as long as the problem is challenging to the group will that still prevent the group from growing? I tend to group in a variety of ways; sometimes by gender, intelligence level and random seating. I never heard that it would send messages to the students. Sometimes it helps a particular student in that group to be heard; perhaps in  a mixed level group he gets lost. In a group based on his level, he perhaps can take charge. Would this hurt him more or less? I want to know if there has been any research done that favored that it was okay for grouping by ability?"
"How is a right-wrong test going to change their mindset, though?"
"I have not been able to navigate back to my answers in Session 1 and see that they have been saved.  How do I do this?  Can you see that my answers have been saved?  When I was doing Session 1 and clicked \Submit\"", I did not get the second part that was in the other sections which asked me to give my answer a 0 or 1 rating.  Does that indicate they weren't saved?"""
"I am preparing to implement a \flipped classroom\"" model this year.  I know it will support different readiness levels and learning styles within my classes.  I am concerned, though, that it will be difficult to merge this approach with inquiry-based discovery activities, that it will lead to more direct instruction instead, and perhaps reinforcing misperceptions of what math is.  Does anyone have experience and insights to offer me?"""
"I enjoy a problem like 4x-3=13. I don't know if I would call it math any more than I would call Sudoku or KenKen math, but I enjoy it. They're like little number games: use the rules to figure it out. And they're very simple to generate, slightly more difficult to generate one with an integer answer, but you can literally make up 100's in a few minutes."
"I was one of the few people who answered 5.5 last Wednesday when this session was posted for a few hours.  When I go back to 5.5, my answer is there and it says waiting to be graded. When I was doing peer reviews waiting for this session to return, I saw that all of the 5.5 answers from last week were graded.  Since I was one of those responses, I expected to get credit for having done 5.5.  Not only did I not get credit, when I look at my peer submissions, it does not show that it is waiting to be graded.  Has anyone received credit for answering 5.5 last week?"
"I often can't hear the video very well when my computer and your volume bars are both cranked all the way up, especially when Jo is interviewing people - she is then inaudible. Can you up the volume setting on your videos?"
I would also like to know how to receive the certificate for the course.  Thanks!
"Yes, I'm also having trouble with the audio level in the videos today.  They are very quiet."
"I work with a few colleagues who would really like to ability group in our middle school mathematics department. A few years ago our school did away with ability grouping at the same time we transitioned to Common Core. The decisions were made independently of each other, but happened at the same time. I am all for not tracking middle school students, but at our school the problem comes when a large number of our students receive additional math lessons outside of our school. This isn't just tutoring to keep up; these are lessons to push them ahead so they are prepared for national exams when they go home. "
"I work with students who disrupt others in the classes.  They are of all abilities and often those students who would otherwise than their behaviour would be called 'high ability'.  They are often and obviously under-stimulated in the classes so their behaviour for learning and their academic learning needs are not being met.  Given the situation they are, not surprisingly eventually, in the 'at risk of exclusion' group, which is my group."
I am right there with you.  I'm not sure what else to do.
I too am having problems with my posting to Q.1.3A... I cannot complete my reply. Solution? Suggestions?
Jo said Session 8 would be released today (Tuesday 8/13).   I specifically set aside time this morning to work on it.  It is now afternoon.  My teacher meetings start Thursday. Please post session 8.
"5.5 Peer assessment is a problem for me right now. Can't access it, just says error occurred. Are people still having trouble with this b/c I noticed that most of these posts are old?"
"My school has a high percentage of lunch program students.  Many students have a low perception of their math skill that has developed over years.  I take a positive approach and discuss with my students concepts of growth and where they want to be in high school.  However many students have \learned helplessness\"". They are better at being helpless than making any attempt.  I have found success with the scaffolding and the growth model in MARS and resources available through this course.  However, I can't get away from grading, state and district assessments, (over 6 big assessments in math in 8th grade, and \""lower\"" scoring students seem to get more assessments.  We do celebrate growth on state tests, and many students show \""high growth\""- Over 60 percentile growth.  My question is how can we promote growth and growth mindset within big tests, grading etc?"""
"I just got a cheery little email from Jo.  It is a bit frustrating, because there is no information in it.  Why didn't she give us an update on the problems with grading?  There is a huge grading backlog in session 1, submissions say there are finished but there is no feedback or grade, and people are having trouble submitting responses.  When will sessions 7 and 8 be posted, because \soon\"" is too vague."""
"Boy, that sums up my own experience as a student of mathematics in middle & high school and college. Good thing I had an excellent memory....How do we ensure that the von Neumann's quote becomes obsolete for the students that are in our classrooms right now, grades K-14?"
"In class, if some one calls 75 3/4 like Julio?"
"Is it correct to say that growth mindset can be perceived as one of integral components of general intelligence (innate ability) that regulates the function and development (speed, memory and meta-cognition) of different domains of intelligence?"
"Is there any \tested\"" way to sit/arrange students so they are in a mixed ability group within their class? It does seem that students who are labeled in a certain way don't attempt to go beyond that misconception."
"Having new students every 5 or 8 weeks gives me a real chance to try something new.  I have been integrating some of these  ideas into the middles of class even.  It's hard because I do have the cram-lots-in-in-a-short-time syndrome.  In many of my online, developmental math classes in for-profit colleges, there is a requirement to comment and \fix\"" other students postings.  Students hate it!  They will refuse to do it and take the point loss rather than do it.  I have tried emphasizing the requirement of doing it, even allowing them to post a similar problem that they do.  Doesn't help.  Maybe I should get them to post something with an error in it for others to fix--maybe an error they KNOW is there?  What do you think?"""
----------
"Hi, I completed this course a number of weeks ago.  I still have assignments in both Sessions 5 and 6 that have not been 'corrected'.  Will this be done so I can get credit for them before Sept. 27??  These have been posted for almost a month."
Just testing to see if UW MERG people can collaborate here.
It helps to see numbers as concrete so that it is easier to move them around.  Like that lady who thought moving numbers was cheating.  I feel sorry for her. Isn't this called subitizing?
How do we create 'spaces to learn'? That is our challenge.
"I have been able to grade, but none of the work I've submitted is being graded, though I did it days ago. There is a message saying that the ETA is 3 days. That message has been there for at least 2 days."
"We do tracking, but only for one course.  After that course, students can choose to take an AP Calc class or move to a Pre-Calc class.  (We allow students to jump from Alg2/trig  to AP Calc, since our Alg2/Trig course covers everything needed for AP Calc)."
Is it too late? Can you think of any ways you might be able to disrupt the perception of fixed ability?
"Hi everyone, I am just wondering if this course will be running next year? I joined very late as I am wrapping up another degree and teaching full time. My twitter handle is <redacted> and I do a lot of enrichment projects with primary students in Australia. If someone knows can you please let me know :)"
I would like to make my room a growth mindset haven but worry about keeping myself on track and working on the growth mindset with parents as well as the students.  The kids can be reinforced daily.  Are there short information filled writings available to share with parents?
"I still have no grading to my session 1 and 2 responses.  I am not sure if this is because I started the course later than most, but would love to see the score reflect my true progress of 100% completed.  Please help."
I completed all of session 3 five days ago and it still shows I haven't completed one question to be entered the forum.  Please fix. Thanks!
Survey? I had the same problem. I can't find it anywhere.
"That student on the left had some different ideas, but they were never shared. Why?"
**What do you think people can gain from doing a dot card number talk?**
Where can I find the one-page sheet she references in Session 8?
How do you Check?
"his question is sort of weighing on my mind, so I'll pop it in here and hope for some answers, even if it's not directly related to stereotypes."
Has anyone gotten 5 & 6 to reappear?
"I am not seeing my posts in Discussion from Session 1. My progress also doesn't show that I have completed any of the session. I am able to give feedback to peers, but I would value the feedback from peers on my own posts. Could you please look into this."
"Research has shown that timed tests inhibit performance.  So how would one give a test with no time restriction, yet still keep the integrity of the test?  Meaning, let's say my 8th grade Algebra I class was taking a test during a 50-minute class period.  4 students wants more time, but they cannot just keep working on the test as they have another class right after.  So when do they take the test?  An, there is really no ay to ensure they do not discuss their test with someone else or do additional studying in the interim."
I would also like to hear the answer to this.
They call h<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> Nick?
Question 4.2. - I am unable to view the following link:
I also like the idea of how numbers are made up of different numbers and the reminder that 10 can be decomposed in several different ways.
"I agree.  What did you think about the discussion at the end, when they were asked if any of the patterns had similarities?"
"Jo,"
"I logged in today, and found session 5 posted, I then watched the video and responded to the first question, but was unable to submit the answer, so I tried reloading the page but since doing so I've been unable to even find session 5.  Has anyone else accessed the session and then had it disappear?"
"I teach special education high school math but also have had the opportunity to teach co-taught classes as well. Once a student is placed in a math class in high school it is nearly impossible to move beyond the expectation, even with summer school. We have started implementing a freshman Humanities and Biology class without grouping but with the choice of earning honors credit by doing more work. The jury is still out. Could this work with freshman math classes as well?"
"My kids have gone to schools where there is no tracking, including even mixed-grade classes. Still, I've repeatedly seen a lack of challenging material; and instead of differentiation, the content is still at a very middle of the road level for all the students.  Disappointing.  Simply not tracking is not the answer.  Differentiation is hard work for teachers.  Teacher expectation bleeds out in so many ways and so often low expectations for all just lowers achievement for all.  How can we prevent just aiming at the \middle\""?"""
"At my school, a high school we have math classes for Honors, A.P. and \Regular\"" students.  I am curious how to offer higher level courses such as honors and A.P. but not \""track\"" students."""
"I have completed the task on session 1, however upon checking the progress tab it still shows 0%.  Do I need to complete the assignment again? "
"On one side of the coin I am a parent and want my daughter to get the best education possible.  I know that the \best\"" students get the best opportunities.  That means the onus is on me to make sure my daughter gets to the higher reading group in Kindergarten, the GT classes beginning in second grad, and avoids summer loss."
"But isn't having both an honors Algebra 2 and regular Algebra 2 class still ability grouping?  Even if the teachers are not in the loop, the students surely are thinking \I'm not good enough for honors Algebra 2.\""  As a student teacher, I taught Precalc under similar circumstances and could definitely see the difference between honors and non-honors students. In my case though, the honors students were more disengaged - they didn't need to pay attention - and some of the non-honors students were confident enough to ask questions, but probably more of them needed to ask questions.  In terms of changing students from fixed to growth mindsets, though, I'm not sure having a regular Precalc class would help."""
I have submitted 5.5 some weeks ago and peer graded some weeks ago yet still no grade for it... ?
What resources would you suggest for further information/guidance in incorporating Number Talks at the middle level?
How will you know they understand this?
Reading so many of these posts. 
I found I had to be in chrome Internet explore did not work.
can see this video but not the videos/interviews/discussions it refers to.
"Same thing happened to me, but hopefully, the tech support will recover this information.  I am waiting a little while, because I too feel that it will be hard to recreate this information!"
How do we ignite this same creativity and level of comfort with older students who haven't had positive math experiences?
"I have same problems, plus problems with progress of 2 'IN' - instructor? - marked assignments."
"Same for me.I did 5 two days ago. Then it disappeared. This morning I peer reviewed 3 responses for 5.5 ( I think that was the section), but lesson 5 isn't shown in the courseware section."
"I have the same question. I would like strategies to start implementing in my classroom, right away. She mentions that her book has more examples, so I will be purchasing it."
"I'm assuming the answer was 10,201.  That is what was on the paper with the equations.  Not the answer I got but Oh well.  :("
I have not been able to see the comments other students have made on my submissions. How can I do that? Thanks!
Two procedural questions: 
I'm the same.  I did the question exactly the way Jo showed it on the video.  But that last step of multiplying 8/15 by 15/8 was a procedure I knew - I couldn't see past it to think about the sense of it so I just did that.  I was watching the video hoping for some illumination on that part but Jo did that too.  I guess that means I need to do some more thinking on that!
"I have had some graded, but I did receive a 0/1 on the introduction. I am hoping this was the glitch folks are talking about."
"Hi Sef, I have a slightly different problem. In Sessions 5 and 6 I cannot type in the response to some of the questions. This has been happening for a few days now. I have tried to log out and go back to the unanswered questions after some days, but still couldn't type in my answers. If this happens, I will not achieve 85% that is expected to pass the course. Pls. let me know if that is something I am not doing right."
"I would like more information about growth mindset built in to the course. I am not clear about what the research is really saying. Who was interviewed, when, by whom? What interventions were done? When, how?"
"I also finished all of session 5 yesterday, but was unable to finish session 6 because half of the videos would not play.  I came back today to see if I could get the videos and both were gone!"
"I'll start at the point that we know...together they paint 8/15 of the house in 1 hour.  How much of the house do they paint in half an hour (4/15) and how much do they paint in a quarter of an hour (2/15), then we can say that they paint 1/15 of the house in 7.5 minutes.  Since what is remaining is the 7/15 of the house after a full hour of painting, you can add the time it takes to paint 7/15 of the house using 4/15 = 30 minutes + 2/15 =15 minutes plus 1/15= 7.5 minutes all together which equals 52.5 minutes.  Therefore together they paint the house in 1 hour and 52.5 minutes which is the same as 1 and 7/8 of an hour."
Do the common core statements state I can?
"Hi Anyone,"
"I'm in the same boat.  Three of us (out of 4 in my department) are taking this class, however, our department chair is not.  So how do we change without our leader being on board?"
Same concern - I submitted something a couple of weeks ago. . . I still have a zero (I think it might be because it has not yet been reviewed).  Don't want to mess up because it was not peer-reviewed
"I would agree that this is my experience, and now as a woman in her 50's needing to teach her young son, my dyscalculia or should I say \dysteachia\"" is causing me great angst as I need to acquire the basic skills and number sense before I can effectively teach my son."""
What is ChrsCSD?
Screencasts are not loading for me (using Google Chrome).  All I see is a blank white screen.
When will the next sessions be posted? I have been checking every day to see if they are here and they are still not.
I still have questions too.  I have completed all 4 sessions but it is not showing that.  Before Session 2 showed 100% and now it does not.  I do not understand and would like to know what is happening or what I need to do.
I'm having trouble watching the video for Session 6 part 1
I'm curious to know - what didn't you think of as effective in that math talk?
"12x15; 12x10=120; 12x5=60 (former method 5x2=10, write 0 in mind and carry 1); 120+60=180. I need this algorithm, every student used their own method or algorithm."
I share your view.  At what point do we encourage students to tackle calculus?  Is it for every student?  Calculus is not necessarily the bee's knees in math; Probability and Statistics has many future applications as well.  Neither is an absolute necessity for entrance to university.  At what point do we differentiate?
"Sorry, but I am not seeing the link to the Nottingham U and the Mars Project so I can look at the lessons.  I'll keep trying, though."
"I enjoyed trying these 3 problems; loved the process but didn't get to the answers, especially in the ratio problem.  I didn't understand how Jo got '2' from her drawing.  Anyone willing to take that part further?"
"That doesn't make sense. Because if you think about it, if you have two people doing the same thing, as painting a house, in this case. One person takes 5 hours and 1 person takes 3 hours, the person who takes 3 hours normally is going to have to take up the 'slack' of the person who takes 5 hours. I'm confused on this one. I've never had a problem like this one."
I don't understand the analysis of the histogram. It looks to me like females underperform if the test does NOT ask for gender...??
"I saw that error as well.  I was hoping that she had caught it and wrote about it in her commentary on this video, but it wasn't in there.   Errors are bound to happen with the number of moves a teacher has to make in the course of a lesson.  She is fun to watch, though!"
Are there 'Honors' classes at you high school?  That would be my question.
"I went to answer a question in section 6 and my computer died.   When I went back in a few hours later, it shows that the questions was answered although there was nothing there.  How do I fix this?"
"This upcoming year, my principal has decided to assign me to teach an \intervention\"" math class. He will pick approx 10 incoming freshmen based mostly on test scores (I'm not sure what other factors he will choose) and place them in this class. He hasn't provided any guidelines for what should be taught in the class or the structure."
"On several assignments for which I have been trying to provide peer feedback, I get the response \error occurred\"" when I click on the link to grade.  Is this a glitch or my computer?"""
Can someone help? 
"So, what if quizzes gave diagnostic feedback, and tests are graded?"
Hello !
"I hope that getting a class to do \Number Talks\"" will work on this issue.  In talking with a senior teacher in my school, she was concerned about getting kids to open up without fear. Any tips on how to gain that cooperative and supportive atmosphere?"""
I too am only seeing 65% completion for session 1 and I believe I have completed everything.
Me too i don't know maybe is a platform bug
I have the same problem. It shows as nothing completed for session 1 even though I have completed all of the assignments.
hello. no student has passed to another level? and students know what level are you? because then as discussed in the course is affecting them is precisely this situation
"BUT ... if we don't ability group to some extent, the lowest kids and the highest kids are BOTH getting short changed.  I actually had a principal try to eliminate ALL grouping in middle school.  So students at the 4th grade level in math would be in the same class with those kids taking Pre-Algebra, and needing to get ready for Algebra the net year.  Her thinking?  Well, the advanced kids can just tutor the low kids, and that way they'll be challenged.  And the lower kids need to see what it's like to be successful at math. I'm so tired of the advanced kids being misunderstood and shortchanged by this kind of narrow thinking.  They need just as much specialized instruction as those kids several years behind. They are just at the opposite end of the bell curve.   And the lower ability kids in this set up?  They just shut down because they don't understand what's going on, and are intimidated by the knowledge the advanced kids have.  There's no easy answer!"
"So I'm wondering if you had all five teachers in each class, or if one teacher was responsible for each class. In my district, class sizes are ballooning due to budget issues, and I always feel more and more constrained on what I'm able to do in the class because of this. I'd love to learn more about the class size effect on this type of learning."
"Not to be too picky, but of the two examples of \good\"" math problems we've been shown, this is the 2nd one involving sports.  I realize that they were both for older students than my daughter (age 9) and that most students in this country are better versed in athletics than my daughter (understatement), but still.  If you have never had any experience with mini-golf (or a track/field hurdle event) you are going to struggle more and the attempt at making this \""real world\"" will have failed.  If you've never made or seen a bank shot (or maybe never even golfed) then it is just as abstract as a question about triangles with no golf reference.  OK - so solution -- take everyone out on a bunch of sports fieldtrips before the math class?"""
I can't seem to access session 5 & 6 at all.
"yes, it is funny no one has pointed this out earlier. Thanks for doing that. Prof. Boaler should take notice of this."
"I'm guessing that the Progress page is still not updated because my score for Session 1 is still at 62%. I notice that others are also finding this to be a problem. Nothing has been recorded for Session 2 on the Progress page yet it says \done\"" when I check my responses. Thank you for all that you are doing to correct these problems."""
Jo just posted a comment that there can be opportunity for reflections/comments/ideas submitted after the course to an email address.  Will there be any way to have access to these further remarks?
"For the past few years, my school has been very heavily using the ability grouping model. The rationale for this has been to help the resource personnel at the school make sure that they can service all of the students they are responsible for. However, I have seen overall drops in student achievement because of this ability grouping. Teachers will either teach to the middle ground, or, believing that they have low achieving students, think they need to be told how to do something and then given drill-based work in order to \practice.\"""
The videos' volume is also very low for me. I had to hook up a small speaker to my laptop to be able to hear them!
"These videos and experiences actually show how to change the **approach** to algebra. And that is great. They haven't (to me) addressed the problem of how to integrate this excellent (again to me) approach to very traditional tests in Math, where most probably a student faces a one-route-to-solution task."
"I had the same thing happen, I completed all of 5 and some of 6.  Most of 6 had lots of problems and I could not watch half the videos.  I logged in today to see if that was fixed and both sessions are just gone.  Let's hope it saved the work!"
"I agree, I would to see a sample for K -3 lesson."
Can someone tell me again where the Japanese lesson Dr. Boeler is referring to in this clip where the teacher gave different options? I only recall the one with the dividing fraction lesson. They seem to all be blurring together at this point. Thanks.
"Hi, I'm hoping the lack of captions is just down to me watching the videos before you have had a chance to add them, and that I am just too keen."
I am unsure wht my session 2 is only marked at 85% complete. I did all the assessments & I can still them but a few are not marked as being done.
Can All the videos be put in one place to downloaded form as downloading each is very tides and also due to slow internet connection not able to view it a pace manner.
"Hi,"
"I'm not meaning to be argumentative, I am really quite curious:"
"I'm unable to get to the session (4.4 etc.) to give feedback. I've gone back to the session, clicked on it - e.g. 5.5 - and I can't find where to enter the forum. But now it's a bit late."
"While dealing with the question 1.3A, I mistakenly pressed the \submit\"" button before having the file of the mind map loaded, and now it seems I can't send it again. I wrote to the Standford online tech support but I haven't received any feedback yet. Moreover, I'm a little bit disapponted that there is no way to contact the staff members directly."""
"Yes, I too have completed all of session 1 but my \progress\"" indicates that I have only completed 62%.  What's going on?"""
"\When are we going to use this?\"" is a question many students ask and for the longest time an acceptable teacher response would be \""for the next course\"" or \""in college\"" or \""probably never, but it will make you be a better thinker\"".  Unfortunately, I don't feel I have better answers than these, except when I am teaching statistics.  Examples of statistics are EVERYWHERE.  Examples of how math might be used by people in careers and how they apply to the current content that is being taught is hard for teachers to know, especially if those teachers have only had careers as teachers themselves.  Does anyone have resources for showing the practical applicability of mathematics?"""
Formatting in submission boxes.
Am I the only one who can't find three ways to solve the question? I've been staring at it for a while and I'm out of ideas.
"Ms Jo,"
"These negative math messages come from many places as seen in this discussion.  A student can overcome these messages when they work hard and succeed, they can \see\"" that they can accomplish the concepts.  But what about those students who continually try hard to understand math concepts and can't seem to get it?  How do we help them with their self-esteem and become believers in themselves that they can do what is expected of them?"""
"Hi all,"
Dear Prof. Boaler:
Checking if my answers are saved is depressing. ;-)  Nothing there...
"I have learned so much in this course, but find myself having difficulty developing appropriate lessons for my elementary students. We have done a number talk with some success, but I need resources for inquiry based elementary lessons.  How much of the elementary skill work still needs direct teach? I want to move forward, but now that school has started I find myself fighting to meld what I have learned with our prescribed scope and sequence."
I am in the same boat.  I have tried Chrome and Firefox (working on MacBook) and the surveys for Sessions 1 and 3 will not show as completed although I have completed them both many times.
I'm having a lot of trouble with the survey - the page is too big for the screen and it won't scroll to allow me to fill in all the answers or navigate to the next page of questions. I am using Google Chrome as my browser.
I am unable to write in the dialog box can I get helped please. 
It's kind of difficult to give feedback to students to help encourage them because I teach in a science museum and students come and go. There's really no foundation to build connection and what to feedback from... 
"My question is about the set up of the class. I will have 2 math track lesson per week and one (4 week/5days/2hours) block for the introduction for new ideas. For the track lessons, should I just stick to these math talks and open ended puzzle type questions? Forget the practice problems all together? My thought is to send home the \problem\"" on Monday for them to digest one their own, have them bring it back Wednesday for group work, due Friday for final presentation. Each of these track lessons is 45 minutes."""
"I'm sorry if this is a repeat.  I thought I posted this question yesterday, but I just looked for it and couldn't find it.  I don't want my teachers to use timed tests for math facts anymore.  We are a K-3 school and we are trying to measure their progress toward fluency with the addition and subtraction facts, as required by CCSS.  Do you have a suggestion how to measure and report fluency without timing the students?"
"Yes I would like more help on this. We sort students into tracks based on testing and other criteria, and these tracks as early as 6th grade become part of what a student thinks they can or can not do."
Anyone tried MIND Research Institute_s ST Math instructional software program? Views on it in terms of mathematical thinking versus skills development?
"I teach at a small high school.  The students are grouped by math ability in that most freshman take Algebra, unless they were \tracked\"" into algebra in middle school and then they take Geometry as a Freshman. Co-op students (with IEPs or 504s) are also with the general population. There is no other (lower)  math choices, all students take Algebra. I think that eliminates traditional tracking at the high school. The groups are varied by skill but not so much by age. I think this style is common. The benefit is that the expectation is that everyone takes Algebra.  The downside can be the maturity level of classes sinks without upper-classmen role models.  Is the alternative \""integrated math?\"""""
"Thanks for your post. I'd like to hear a response to your last question.  My gut feeling is that with some gentle questioning or extended think time, the careless mistakes will be caught by the student who made it.  As a teacher, usually you can tell which type of mistake you are dealing with.  I have seen posters that say \Never make the same mistake twice.\""  This might serve as a discussion prompt if you are seeing recurring careless mistakes.  It leads right into the fact that mistakes are an opportunity to learn."""
I am wondering if anyone knows if these sessions will be available later in the school year.  I would love to have the rest of my staff view some of these sessions throughout the school year to help them with their math instruction.  I think the growing a growth mindset would be a fantastic on going discussion to have with faculty and view some of Jo's videos for reinforcement.
"I have been unsuccessful in submitting my peer assessment comments. The cursor won't appear in the text box for me to respond and the only way I can move on is to \submit\"" which takes me to the next question. When I try to return (as I do for the self assessment questions and then 'try again'), it won't let me. It shows that I haven't submitted my answers but it is really a case of it not letting me. Any suggestions would be most appreciated."""
I completed session 7 but none of it is showing up on my assessment panel.
I have completed the survey twice now but it still says I have not completed this survey.
"I completely agree that number sense is an issue for many students. They do not understand why it works, they just do it. However, number sense is so critically developed in earlier grades, what can you do once a student gets to middle school and still does not have number sense?"
"I would also be interested in seeing what number talk resources or ideas are available for high school, though I imagine that most high school students never had the opportunity to develop a flexible number sense and would benefit greatly from these simple exercises."
It took a while for the survey to be accepted.
I would like someone to share their resources with me as well.
It is down to the last hour and I can't grade my last couple of entries so it looks like I have not completed lesson 6. Is this going to be open tomorrow?
I very much appreciated that the students feel free to use the 'best' strategy. . . but also free enough to listen to other strategies and try to figure out how those will work in the solution process.
I think I've asked this before... How do we actually share with each other using the Forums?  I cannot see anyone else's responses unless they have also posted them in the discussion section under each video.  
"Now that you mention this, it is concerning. Why were only boys in the discussion about Nick's class?  Also in Cathy's class when they discussed division, 2 boys showed the correct answer and the confused student was a girl!"
I have a similar question but would modify to ask about any course beyond Algebra (1 or 2).
"I keep hearing that teachers should not accelerate their gifted and talented students but should  instead take them deeper into their grade level content standards.   So what does that mean?   Also,  I would love to see examples of what that looks like for elementary students.   Thanks so much,  this class was amazing."
I could read part of it and not the rest. I just looked it up and found it online.
I joined this course very late and doubt whether I will achieve much in the time left. May I join the student course which follows?
"I have anwesered all the assignments in session 1, but 1.3B and 1.4 does not show (They have dissapered)."
"Can you explain \dynamic grouping\"" a little more?"""
"I have often been told that, and passed on that information, but in my actual teaching experience, it is often not true.  Or rather, they may remember the problem, but it doesn't mean they necessarily remember the solution or the conclusions we found from the solution any better.  Has anyone else had that experience?"
Why is my ETA still 3 days in the Open problems (problems I have submitted) - They are not getting graded - Why ?
I noticed that the students were all on task and engage during the collaboration.  What methods does she use to make certain that they are all participating?
Sections 5 & 6 do not come up when I go to coursework either. Is there another way to get there?
"I am having the same problem. Looking over this forum, it seems many people are waiting a long time for reviews to come back. I have been waiting several weeks myself, although I have graded others."
"I have completed this twice, but it doesn't show as completed.  Am I doing something wrong?"
Yeah where the heck is the check button!!!
"Hi,"
I see my own learning reflected in your ideas!  Would you be willing to elaborate on your clearer understanding of kids who were 'fighting' you in the classroom?
I loved this course until the last week when trying to submit work and all i get is the stupid try again coming up. Have written in the discussion that this is happening.
"I, too, have the same problem! Still poking around.....  ;-)"
"It's so ironic that this is how I came to feel incapable of appreciating music. I was told that because I couldn't carry a tune, I was not musical. Perhaps that's why I turned toward mathematics, which was presented to me as the \opposite\"" of music."""
"Will the course lectures, references, etc, continue to be available after the formal class completion date?  It would be most helpful to be able to refer to this course and all the materials as I attempt to implement the concepts and techniques presented in this course.  It would also be helpful to have a document (similar to the research summary document) that outlines the major topics of each session a la survey 8.4."
me too. thought i was finished the course and today i look to see that there are peer submissions to grade! yesterday they said none? How does peer grading fit into the deadline?
"Just want to note that the transcription of the video is calling the new math content standards \Common Call\""  rather than \""Common Core\"" as is correct. Can this be fixed?"""
"I had similar issues yesterday.  Not sure what happened so I just redid things.  Also, I am finding it a bit tricky navigating this course - I think I have finally realized how to get to peer review."
"When asked to respond to a bit of video, such as question 3.2, it would be helpful to be able to save your progress on the response and go back to view sections of the video or text of the video.  When I typed a response to question 3.2 and then returned to the video for a reference and returned to the response, everything that I had typed was gone."
"I have definitely heard that boys are generally better in math than girls. I think I always accepted this instead of trying to challenge it. Even though I like to do well in everything I do, I think I too have used this as an excuse for the struggles I had in math."
I hear from my students;
"Perhaps my colors are a bit off on my laptop...but when I look at the graph presented, it appears that the experimental group scores continue to go down while the control group's go up after the intervention."
ops...actually I am using Safari. Will I have to start again?
"I taught my second grade students to do fingermath (ones on right hand, tens on left) this past year. I thought it helped my students, as it is a terrific tool to use in addition and subtraction. But is it a good idea as far as growth mindset is concerned?"
How long does it take to receive the peer feedback? I haven't gotten any yet but worked on them a week or more ago :(
I'd like to be able to get my responses as well.
"I am able to watch the videos in Session 7, but cannot enter responses into the text box for the \quizzes\""."""
"You are fortunate to live in a community and disrict that values math practices and experiences. Is it a community that thrives in expecting high achievement scores in testing? I understand high expectations, but I often hit the wall when test scores are the \end\""!"""
"I, too, have this issue.  Also, I have been waiting for peer feedbAck for 6 days when the estimated wait time was 3 days.  Should I be concerned?"
"the video link isn't working for me, but the download link worked fine"
"I made the whole session 1, but error appears 1.3 and 1.6 and will not let me edit. Any advice please? There says waiting to be graded"
**<nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>**In the peer feedback section on session 4.5 it says I have only graded 2 peers. When I go to grade more it tells me I am finished and wont let me do more. What do I do?
Where can I find that article?
"I did the math ok with this problem, but I am still not sure WHY you multiply the 8/15 by 15/8.  Confused on that part, even though that's what I remember about solving the problem!!"
The survey will not allow me to submit because it says I have to enter a number into the hours section - I repeatedly put in numbers and it repeatedly gets booted back to me with the same prompt. Help
"As a parent, I speak with enthusiasm about math.  I notice a subtle type of stereotype in the air in my affluent and politically correct community -- that is, that certain boys are just so much BETTER than bright girls.  Thus it isn't that the girls can't do math, it is just that they are not on the same level.  This is really the same thing dressed up a bit.  I find it very hard going to take this on in one-on-one conversations with children I guide.  But I try to point it out and to encourage.  "
I too am having the same problems hopefully it will be fixed soon because I don't know if you can move on to the next section.
"I am a teacher in Los Gatos, California and our middle school tracks in math. Are there any similarly affluent middle schools in our area or elsewhere who are in the process of adopting the CCSS without tracking? We need to study schools where this is happening and learn what works, what doesn't work etc. in order to consider making this important change ourselves."
Does anyone know if there's a place that has an assessment to help identify the mindset of students? I think it would be helpful to have some questions around this to discuss with the students.
I got that same message on one of my responses - my response is there although it is shown as partially submitted - so there's still a glitch there.
I'm an NZ teacher. Did you have 4 groups of kids with differing abilities in each group? What strand or strategies were you working on?
Do you think the pretest and post test we saw in our previous assignment on the map.mathshell.org website will help to do this? As long as we know before the lesson where the issues are we can address them.
"Thank you for doing these. I tried to watch video # 5, but I find that video #4 plays for both #4 and #5 on the list of links. "
"Same problem here.  Session one shows no progress, session two complete."
"I was not surprised to learn the percent of community college students who needed to enroll in remedial math courses.  I was surprised, however, to learn how many students do not complete their AA, and that math is the primary roadblock.   I teach Algebra to eighth graders, and am worried that many of them are headed toward serious difficulty in achieving their educational goals because of their struggles with my course.  I do not want to be their \Mrs. Glass\"".  "
"How are we going to receive our \certificate of completion\""?  Just wondering!"""
Please add to resources page or advise us where to find them.  
Yes I would like to have these resources accessible after 27 Sep. Is that possible?
Would not load in the open screen.  Can someone tell me why?
"I agree. I'd signed up for the class a week ago, didn't bookmark it and was temporarily flummoxed when I got the e-mail but no link back to the course."
Also having the same problem.
"I found your classroom homepage..very nice. But, which tab is the concept map under?"
"I think that it's great that they can be so \free\"" in 3rd grade. It's only going to help them as they grow older."""
How can I erase an answer I have already submitted and make changes when I realize I made an error?
I can find no recognition that I completed session 1.  Does this mean I have to start over?  
I'm trying to find the fireside chat video that was supposed to be available by now on the course site according to Jo's last post.  Where can I find it?
"Your comment really catches my attention, because I share the question of what to do with students who miss more than half of the school year?"
"I am having the same difficulties with question 2.6D, I reloaded the page, logged off and back on, waited several hours and tried again."
"I may sound cynical, but, it is easier said then done.  Some of the English speaking students don't understand English.  How can they understand model? Can some one share wht do you do in such case? Some students are visual, some students will understand if some one shows them once and some students have a pure abstract thinking brain.  My question: Is this method prescribed for ll (one size fits all) or it has to be customized?"
Today I did all of lesson 5. It was listed on the bottom of the progress sheet. Now it's gone.
"I have completed sessions I-III, but I have not received full credit for session I.  When I look back through the questions, I did answer all 8 that were in the session, but my progress shows that 3 questions were not completed.  Why?"
I prefer teaching mixed ability classes as the interactions are more interesting and real wow moments are where weaker students are able to explain a concept to the higher ability students.  I do however find it hard work as it requires more planning and I struggle with assessments - do all students get the same assessment task?
"Algebra is a form of high thinking.  It is the use of symbols, geometry, and variables which make the human mind stretch and grow."
"Just to say, the problem is still there - 0/1 for 2.7, even though I've done it."
Are there other resources that you can share to help teachers and parents further develop skills in nurturing a growth mindset in our students?
This course certainly presents a different perspective. Can you get them to take a look at some of the videos with you?
"Perseverance, resilience, self-efficacy - how do we build this in math students/in ourselves?"
"me too...5.5 doesn't show on my grading waiting list at all....Plus I still cannot go into grading area, so I cannot give others a grading...."
This is one of those that is going to require a lot of thinking....on my part. I think I have to first do a little addition and subtraction to get to the algebra part but if I take my time I know I can do it.
"I answered the question: \slightly irritated: I have to redo the problem again\"" as the closest one to how I tended and tend to feel when I made a mistake in math -- but this doesn't quite tell the whole story. I think how I felt about my math blunders, of which there were and are many - depended on the context in which it happened. I felt very differently about mistakes when it was in the context of tests and exams, than when it was in the context of studying with my friends and practicing examples in the more supportive and social setting of my study groups. So it is hard to answer that question in general terms - except that because in math class it felt - more often than not - that it was a test or an evaluation of how well we understood the material - or how good of a student one was - I did say that slightly irritated is the best answer in my case from the options in the survey."""
I have also checked the progress sheet a number of times and it's not completed. Probably some bugs to work out in the system or I am not using the courseware correctly.
Thank you for this fix! I have been reviewing my previous submissions and was able to make some fixes to add in the credit 1. But...I have found that several of my responses from before have disappeared! I have come up with new answers and have submitted them...but I keep finding more that when I go to that question (like in the first section...but I'm on section 6 now) it's blank as if I never submitted anything. And when I resubmit I have to go through the whole practicing to grade my peers and grade 3 more peers...
"This session helped confirm in my mind what math teaching should be. It seems with the implementation of so much district-wide and state testing, the joy of teaching math has been on the wane the last few years. I SO wish the administrators in my district were taking this course!!!!!"
It sounds so simple. But to get a class going to do some mistakes I would try to get a interessting task like building a double-swing I saw in the garden of a ozeanograph. It showed a certain way of waves influencing each other. 
"I still struggle to understand in elementary school, how much of the 'basics' need to be 'taught', before or alongside engaging in the more open-ended approach to mathematics pointed at in this course?"
"Craig, I do not believe there is an answer key.  These would be great problems to ask about in office hours, though."
"I believe the office hours will be accessible to remote students. At least, that's the impression I got from reading <redacted> <redacted> email yesterday. There were no specifics. In a previous class the TAs used Google Hangout."
I think normal distribution since n is more than 30
"Yes, we <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> have remote OH starting next week.  Monday 5-7 and Thursday 6-8. Details about how to participate TBA."
"As the course about to start I would like to suggest between 80 to 90 to get distinction and 90+ to get high distinction, I hope guys you have your say about this so the staff can work this out before its too late to do so."
Yeah I'd like to know more about that
"Hello everyone! My name is Chris <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>, I am a cycling and running coach in Houston, TX. I am taking the class to earn CEUs for my certifications as well as to help me understand what I can do in my own racing and training to perform better in competition."
Hey all!
"Hi,"
It wasn't clear to me where to find the Check for Understanding sections.  I did find it after this section by accident.  It would be helpful to label the buttons appropriately.  I'm really enjoying the format and materials so far.  Great job!
Howdy!
The desire to undress when core temperature drops - makes me curious about any research on the hypothalmus and hot flashes - of course related to lack of estrogen but not a universal response to lack of estrogen - Appears the behavior is the same in some menopausal women as in some people experiencing severe hypothermia - a similar response despite the vastly different circumstances - any ideas?
"Hi, I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Scotland. I am embarking on a long held desire to learn about sports physiology and thought this course would be a great place to start. Really looking forward to it and great to meet you all."
"Form the physical point of view, how those avacore devices can be beter than a bucket of hot water with some mustard powder dissolved? That's how we warm up in Siberia anyway :-)"
"I think some of the other online classes in here do have this function, but I do not think this class offers it.  lets look forward for their improvement :)  good luck on the class!!"
"Hi, my name's <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>. I'm from Vietnam. I studied Human and Animal Physiology when I was an undergraduate student. Then I studied Public Health at Hanoi school of Public Health in Vietnam. Now, I am working as a translator in Public Health. I participate in this course because I'd love to learn how human beings adapt to the world. I hope you (lecturers and learners from all parts of the world) will help me to understand what I feel confused about. Thank you all."
"I'm halfway through the first week, and I love this course. I was wondering if there is an age limit to participate. Two of my children are in sixth grade and straight A students. With my supervision, could I sign them up for the course."
"Just retired as a family physician here in San Diego.  But I grew up in Montana and still shiver just thinking about being cold.  Seems like our mind-set can make us more susceptible to the cold, too."
"Hi, my name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> and I live next door to Stanford.  I am thrilled to be able to take this class.  I have experienced the sensation of shivering a few times after I finished swimming in the bay. Watching the way Corey's hands did not work correctly reminded me of mine.  I sometimes could not take off my wetsuit because I was shaking so much and my hands did not open and close easily.  Through this Cold Module I will be able to understand why.  Thanks.  Nice to meet all of you!"
I feel that it had to do with the air around him and the evaporation of the water on his skin. It was strange though since I thought the body loses heat faster in water than in air of the same temp.
Talking about getting cold --
I am curious to learn more about Hunters Response.  I've don't recall ever experiencing this response.  Has anyone?
Hi! Does anybody know is it possbile to download the videos?
I think that it is important to inhale the air through the nose in order to warm the air you are inhaling before it reach the lungs. And maybe put some scarf over mouth and nose...
I don't know the water temperature but all I can say is the bay is frozen over so a hole was cut and the air temperature was about -15 degrees celcius.
"I think that it varies depending on how quickly the temperatures change. As an example, living here in Maine, most of last week was sub-zero for the daytime highs. The past few days have been in the upper 30s to low 40s. To me,its comfortable in a long sleeved tshirt or maybe a light fleece. I didn't feel that way in the middle of November when we had similar temperatures."
"Interesting discussion. Not being a triathlete myself, I'm curious to see where it goes. After doing a quick literature search, I didn't come up on any swimming to bike afterdrop research in triathlon. However, I've attached a link to Dr Nuckton's (Expert Interview) Alcatraz afterdrop study on swimmers in the San Francisco Bay because it may be of interest. "
Using version 6.1.3 I haven't had this problem with an iPad. Could it be a software specific issue?
well maybe it's simple misunderstanding - did you mean 50 degrees Fahrenheit? I though about Celsius degrees.
"ok, now I see, thanks. Maybe it's worth indicating the scale in the quiz."
"Ryan,"
"I remember Allen Lim having Garmin cyclists wear cooling vests during their \warm-up\"" before some TdF stages. So this is in line with the theory that slighty cooler core will result in higher V02 output, while also possibly tricking the mind into activating the muscles to work harder?"""
Just finished the section on Cold.  Great presentation.  It stimulated  a number of queries on google.  
"Recenly, a tv program on extremes showed a man from Holland, who demonstrated an ability to stand in a tub filled with ice water up to his neck (wearing only his trunks) for an hour w/o loss of core temp. His temp. was measured every minute by an Austrian cold rescue unit (who commented that normally hypothermia occurs within 15 mins). Per the broadcast, he succeeded and only once did his core drop momentarily, at which time he raised it back to normal by the next reading. He claims to have developed the ability to redirect his venous blood flow and trains a small class of students his techniques. Are adaptive results, or this type of hypothermia training understood?"
Anyone know the stats as to the causes of drowning in cold water immersion cases?
Any advice on available information regarding inter / intra individual variation pertaining the after drop?
"His physical ht. and wt. not given, but he appeared to be an average size man, not particularly muscular, but athletic proportions and healthy appearance. Age est. in the 40 something. His class showed  students, male and female genders, working on acquiring these skills in cold water (beach?)."
"I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> from Chennai, India. I enjoyed watching the first video  and the mini lecture that followed. It's good to know how we cope with extremes though over here it is more extremes of humidity and heat rather than cold. I enjoyed listening to how the body responds to extreme cold and the metabolism involved.I am basically from the humanities with my knowledge of physiology limited to what I learned in High School. "
I also found this a bit of a problem. Lab videos are quite loud and regular interviews are very quiet. I do not want to miss anything so I hope this gets resolved.
"Hello, "
As Youtube is blocked in my country I cannot access the videos easily. How can I download them?
"Ah, got it!  I misread the question - it's about what is *protective*, not what is a risk factor, so the order from the slide is reversed. Sigh..."
"When doing high power/strength work in the cold (e.g. lifting heavy object, kicking a ball etc), does the temperature of the muscle and tendon affect the risk of an acute injury, such as a muscle/tendon tear?"
The course is very interesting so far. I am finding that the information is adding my basic knowledge of anatomy and physiology. One question - I thought that we lost heat through our heads and also feet?
"Hi everyone! I'm <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>. I'm a general practitioner from Iran. I was always interested in physiology and also always wondered how to make it practical in life. I am a little afraid of doig things which may be dangerous like  mountain climbing, swimming in the ocean, etc. When I saw this course I was so excited because it seemed to be the answer to my question."
I love the course. I think it is great that you used story-telling as a method to get the messages across. I have a question: I know that Coursera has a link so that you can add your achievements to your Linkedin profile:
Could be. I recently updated to iOS7 and there have been some issues. I think this new version is a step backward. I hate the new interface.
"Thank you for that information. I recently had shoulder surgery and experienced extreme shivering in the recovery room. It freaked out my wife. I didn't even remember shivering, but she told me about it. The nurse told her it was a fairly common occurrence and not to worry about it. My wife not worry?"
"Good day everyone!  First of all, thank you for this amazing course.  I usually find it difficult to follow online courses but this one has me hooked and I found myself completing the first part in one sitting.  I would have kept going!"
Do the Avacore devices mentioned in the start of the video cause any pain? Due to the vacuum after the intense vasoconstriction?
"Hi,  "
"I exercise a lot in the cold. I HATE being cold, so watching the video wasn't much fun when seeing how cold he was getting...I've been so cold after a workout someone else had to release my pack clip...my hands were too cold and wouldn't work."
"Interesting video, I had not heard the term brown adipose tissue (BAT) before."
"My name is <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>> & I live in coastal North Carolina.  I'm a great-grandmother of five who is leaving for the Galapagos & Machu Picchu next month. The altitude in Peru concerns me as I've lived at sea level for many years & experienced altitude sickness in Bogota, Colombia in the early 90's. I write a blog on travel & other goals at any age, BucketListing101."
"Like MAST(compression) trousers to prevent shock, I wonder if heated gauntlet gloves and socks with leggings could be developed using a smaller pack than what is used in a sporting goods hand warmer.  The pack would be at the wrist area and ankle area but would give off heat slower."
"PBS replayed a BBC show last August (no, don't recall the name) which stated very strongly that ***some*** people can change their VO2 max through exercise, but ***others*** can't.  Further, it stated that there was a genetic test that could tell where the individual fell on the continuum of ability to increase VO2 max through exercise.  I have never seen that repeated anywhere and would like to know more."
"NancyJo, I work with a paratriathlete who has Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which has led to deterioration of the myelin sheaths in her extremities particularly. She would NOT be up for any cold weather adventure as her nervous responses are already so impaired. 40 degrees Fahrenheit can bring her to a stop, and we are always looking for better ways to keep her extremities warm on cooler days.  Of course, what I'm learning here is that overall body heat is a key component in that equation, and I have some other ideas as well based on information that is new to me."
"I've wanted to start doing this in order to simulate the effect of blood flow going from your skin/tissue back into the core, and then letting it reverse by changing the temperature of the water. I've heard that is an old remedy for helping your body's metabolism and in some cases practiced by people who have lived very long lives (not sure about statistics). "
"Hello, just a California girl who is wanting to learn more about the many extreme conditions covered in this amazing class.  Dr. Freidlander said that babies do not shiver. I once gave my 1.5  month old niece a bath and she looked like she was shivering. What in fact was this response? She trembled like she was cold. Was it a fear response?    It was a quick bath and she was happy as a clam after we were done. Good luck to all."
"I was a swim teacher for several years, specially teaching little kids, and it was amazing to understand better about hypothermia! I had to deal with it almost every class during winter time, and I usually got hypothermia stage much before the children did! Never could understand that, but now I guess it_s about the BAT, am I right?"
Hi Marc!
"I started a daily does of Corgard in November, and find that I am struggling more with my endurance levels and my ability to keep my hands warm in the cold. I have had some success with eating more before and during, and I also think that I am adjusting as time goes by.  However, I'm curious what is different in the overall process because of the beta blocker."
"I was surprised to hear how the body temperature drops with exercise.  I understand, now, in relation to this experiment, but how does it work after running a marathon? If the person is running for 26.2 miles, I would expect all the arteries to be dilated by the end of the race already. Usually in \cold\"" regions they will give a blanket or something to prevent hypothermia after the race."
"The topic of brown adipose was very interesting to me. I'm curious about the fact that it tends to be found in leaner adults. I wonder if this has to do with genetics. For instance, if a person is genetically inclined to have a faster metabolic rate or to be leaner are they more likely to possess brown adipose than a person who has lost weight and is at the same body mass index as the former individual. Is the theory of making yourself cold via cold showers or running around in the snow a viable one? Or are these people just looking for another way to get out of exercise ;)"
How is a dog's physiology different from a human's? They can stand in cold water without lowering their core temperature.
"Hi, everyone. Greetings from Portugal. "
"Hey everyone, I am a young active lady who has had hypothyroidism for the last 10 years...as a result I take a synthetic thyroid hormone since mine no longer functions.  I have noticed over time that I have less and less tolerance for cold, and my hands and feet are generally freezing in any cool weather.  I fortunately live in Houston, so our cold days are few and far between.  Am I right to assume from the lectures that because of my thyroid no longer functioning on its own, my body does not produce all the hormones needed to adjust to cold?"
"This is a hot issue for me.  A 40 km run will not be at VO2 max.  So what difference if you change VO2 max?   I don't think it matters.  Now, what does matter is the pace you can maintain for 40 km.  And working on that may involve very different activity than increasing VO2 max.  It is just different."
How american survived in -52 in this winter
Is their a way I can get hold of the dataset referred to the in the examples. I want to try out the following scenarios and see the effect on variables.
So far I really enjoyed the material. I do open water swimming and Olympic length triathlons and one of the hardest things for me is when the water is cold I just can¡¯t get my stroke down and fall into a rhythm like I can in a heated pool. So I¡¯m going to try and acclimatize myself this summer by taking cold showers and practicing in some lakes instead of the pool.
"You also may have Raynaud's syndrome. It's actually really common.  Women have it more than men, and there are varying degrees.  I've known some women who have it, and sometimes I think I have it, too.  I use hand warmers on cold days to keep it from happening.  You know, I've known about this for quite some time, though I don't know the physiology behind it... now I'm curious!"
"I find that when my feet are cold, there's absolutely no way for the rest of me to be warm.  The only way I can alleviate this is with socks; an electric blanket on my feet doesn't work.  It's something I don't understand."
"In this case, why is it that I don't ever need to breath through my mouth even when I'm on a treadmill taking a stress test?  The test requires that my pulse rate reach a certain level and I always reach it in 9-10 minutes. I can do very, very fast dancing for a whole evening with almost no breaks without opening my mouth.  Any ideas?"
Does anyone know why contact with water affects temperature more than air?  Is it the density of molecules that make for more efficient transfer of energy?  Just curious...

"I am 53. I began HIIT about 10 years ago and as an experiment in performance optimization, I did only nose breathing during my workouts. It was a difficult practice, however, once it became habit, I was able to exercise for longer periods of high-intensity where my heart rate was 230. Several people have suggested that this is a dangerous heart level \for a woman your age\"", although the only consequence I have seen is my age 50 routine EKG reported \""abnormal bradycardia\"". "
"I was wondering why the cold affects our joints/bones. As a kid I remember my mom always telling me to bundle up lest I end up with rheumatic joint pain. A friend of mine broke his leg badly a long time ago, but whenever it is really cold out his leg hurts and affects his mobility. What exactly is the cause of this/what effect does cold have on the joints? Is it really just a lack of blood/using different muscles that is affecting it?"

"I sometimes experience swollen fingers when exercising in the heat, much more when I'm hiking for several hours than when I'm running.  After the discussion on hyponatremia, I'm wondering if this has to do with the fact that I drink water more consistently during a hike than I do when I'm running; maybe I am taking in too much water than the exertion level requires?  Our rule of 'thumb' :) on our hikes is 'salt your sausages', meaning that we need to take in more salty food, which also seems to fit with this conclusion.  Once I have stopped hiking, the fingers go back to their normal size within half an hour or so and I am not in any danger of hyponatremia (I don't believe), but it would be nice to find a way to avoid the swelling altogether with my hike diet.  I haven't been able to get the balance right on most of the warmer hikes."
I would be interested in knowing why BAT in babies is located in these areas as well.  
"Many years ago in the winter I was in Finland at a sauna with temperature readings in the rooms of 130+F. When some got too hot then would run out into the snow and jump into open water. The air temperature was well below freezing and the water temperature was about 45-50F. Then they came back in to heat up and repeat the process.Intuitively this seems very dangerous, even for a trained athlete and some of the men  in the sauna were older and appeared way over weight."
Are children better or worse at heat tolerance?  I help coach cross country to 4th - 8th graders in the afternoon when the temperature can sometimes be in the 80's.  Should they be running then?  We haven't lost anyone yet!
"Was going to ask the same question.  My fingers always seem to swell when I'm warm, but I find if I put them in cool water the swelling seems to go down faster than not having them in water.  Now wondering if the reaction it has is similar to the reaction the water/fingers had in the cold section."
"My personal experience is that wool is amazing stuff for cold to cool weather.  It can even be ok in medium temp/pleasant weather...  I'm not a scientist... Just going on my lack of sweat and comfort.  In hot weather, it would certainly be a bad idea... Plus you might ruin the material as moisture relaxes the wool.  Still if its very thin anything is worth trying to prevent sunburns and reflect some heat?  No?"
"Sure 0.05 at each side, but why at each dimension? The definition says **not for every** j x_j is in [0; 1], but **for at least one** j. So there are a lot (2^p - 1) of boundary variants."

"I LIVE for ice baths after workouts to deal with a plethora of aches/pains/injuries associated with hips/knee/lower back .... swear they work.  Now Ice Bath means Vermont cold well water, or when in Florida adding several bags of ice to the tap water run into the bath; think it's around 50-55 degrees.  I can see how doing something like finishing with cold in the shower can be equally theraputic; maybe something to do with vascular constriction and reduction of inflammation?"

"Due to my fair skin complexion I often wear sun protective clothing (arm sleeves, leg sleeves) while cycling.  I wonder about anyone's thoughts and experiences using these and how it affects their performance and perception of heat ?  One advantage I see is that by wetting the sleeves with cool water it can increase rate of evaporation and create a source of moisture beyond sweat.  Although in the hottest of temperatures I feel coolest with bare skin. So for the hard climbing efforts I roll down and then roll back up for descents. Any others using sleeves during rides or runs ?"

When Cory was in the cold, his head remained very red (compared to other areas of the body). I'm just trying to think this through. Do you lose more heat because heat is concentrated in your head (and torso) first (and that's where the heat is to lose), or is it mostly the answer posted by ygs above?"

This is what stood out to me also. It is not only wrong but it is malicious that the U.S. would deny women this right.

"Karen, I agree with you when you say \all tactics and methods of warfare are unacceptable and should be illegal.\""  There's a common tendency, though, to think (or hope) that women would advocate against war if they were in positions of power, but I worry that that hope paints a picture of women as naturally nurturing and non-agressive-- a picture that is reflective of traditional, stifling gender roles.  I also think that the concept of women in positions of political power as peace makers has been falsified by the majority of women themselves who have held (or currently hold) positions of power.  Some of them may be talented diplomats and politicians, but I have yet to hear any of them suggest anything as radical as calling the legitimacy of war itself into question.  My sense is that radical action (or speech) is difficult at that level of power-- maybe working toward raising the number of women in decision-making positions is useful in some ways but can be paired with more grassroots attempts at cultural change (e.g. changing people's everyday concepts of right and wrong) on the ground?  Easier said than done..."""

One of the questions that I have is how much we can characterize or define conflict or warfare by the violence it perpetuates against women.

"CEDAW is something I am aware of and absolutely support - but as an Australian, how you do you think I can conribute in this area and support what CEDAW stands for?"
The United States has not ratified CEDAW. But to be honest I didn't even know about CEDAW until I started taking this class. I wonder if that is the case for many women in the States? I also wonder how many women in countries that have ratified CEDAW know about it and benefit from it?
"Asserting their sovereignty, I think."
"The concept of the feminization of poverty is not new to me; however, it is important to note the differences between poverty in the United States and poverty in developing countries. Despite the vast differences between the two, it is interesting that whether it is in the first world or the third world, women constitute the largest portion of the poor. I have long thought that women's education was critical to improving equality and equity for women both in the U.S. and abroad. But now, I think this is a naive perspective. Education can only do so much -- it is the iron cycle of poverty that must be broken I do believe that improved access to education is strong enough to bring about the radical change necessary to de-feminize poverty."
"In section 3.4 Professor Hastie gives a brief description of variable selection methods such as forward and backward selection using a variety of measures of model quality.  I was under the impression that these methods have serious problems and should be avoided.  In his book \Regression Modeling Strategies\"", Professor Frank Harrell gives harsh criticism of variable selection,  due to the effects on the estimation bias of model coefficients and variances. Also, in the introduction to his method on the lasso [Tibshirani, R. (1996). Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Methodological), 267-288],  Professor Tibshirani mentions the negative effects of these methods on prediction accuracy. "
"I can see that my nation Kenya is a signatory of CEDAW, however, I am not sure whether my country has ratified the treaty. If not, could there be likelihood that my nation is not serious with human rights? My question is as a result of 2007/2008 post-election violence which left many women and girls raped and others lost their lives. Similarly, the proceeding at the ICC seems to loose grip, thus making me to be afraid that, the victims of the Kenya's 2007/2008 post-election violence may not receive the expected justice.In fact, what is the role of CEDAW in this particular case? Has it accomplished it or not?"
I was very surprised to hear that the united States still had not signed on with CEDAW and the CRC. But a question that I had was about sovereignty and why this is the case. Who is running our nation and how can we find out?
"I disagree.  If you have the right to vote but cannot feed yourself or access appropriate healthcare when you are sick, do you really have any rights?  Your right to vote doesn't mean anything if it doesn't bring about fundamental change and your most fundamental rights, those that are necessary for your survival, are not present (thus do not exist for you), which can result in your death and a termination of a claim for any rights."
"I agree with both of you on this matter - I hadn't heard of CEDAW until now. I too was taken aback about how many reservations the UK had, but at the same time are you really that surprised about them bringing the monarchy/armed forces into it? Definitely an eye-opening exercise."
"In the last recent years we hear about break throughs in genetic research, such that different manipulations of the genetic code of different organisms can be done. Clearly, such abilities raise ethical concerns. I am wondering what kind of concerns we are going to see when different anti-aging treatments become available."
In the interview with Helen Stacy she crearly sais the US hasn't signed the CEDAW or the CRC treaty at all! Strange because it does day so on the UNTC website..

"What I appreciated about the interviews was that they reinforced the need to bring these human rights issues to the forefront, to make it commonplace to talk about it and to educate leaders that these are true and pressing concerns for the injustices that still plague our society today. They are making strides to promote worldwide awareness to change these policies, but how do we enforce following through on these treaties/laws? As more and more women take power, and become leaders, the more we can expose, educate and lead the charge in changing the laws on what should be equal and not acceptable in societies. President Obama for instance discussed last night in the State of the Union address equal pay for equal work for women in the workforce. He is also requiring access to affordable healthcare for all. As more and more women become involved in government, the more changes can be made to archaic laws. "

"The statistics from \The World's Women and Girls 2011 Data Sheet\"" are pretty alarming. Especially in regards to women believing more than men that they should be beaten. What confused me is the origin of this belief. Why is it that more women believe this than men? Is it more of a social oppression? Do men not actually believe it, but it is too good of a form of psychological control to make a change? This form of mental un-health can definitely explain the high levels of suicide in women in rural areas. This psychological oppression is incredibly unhealthy! "

"I am very surprised at some of the statistics related to the health of women in the United States as compared to those of \less developed\"" countries-- particularly when it comes to the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and the relatively low number of women in parliament. It is striking, especially when I compare our numbers to those of our to our neighbor to the north, Canada. What might these numbers suggest about the roles that women in American society are expected to take on? Perhaps, there is insufficient access to high quality prenatal care for American mothers-to-be. The rate of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births may also be related to the high rate of obesity and diabetes in this country. The poor in our country experience malnutrition of a completely different form. I used to work in South Boston, and many of the children in the community (while they were not going hungry) grow up habitually snacking on foods that are laden with unhealthy fat, salt, and sugars and lack nutrition."

Imagine the lifespan of a community where the childbearers and the new generations are so stunted by ill health and malnutrition? there would end up being a few very old and lonely men left after a while... It makes me think that perhaps the men are suffering from something psychological of their own? would it not, then be worthwhile to attend to the psychological needs of the men in order to protect and resolve the needs of the women and children?"

"A curiosity has been present for some time regarding humans that practice bodybuilding and rely upon fats as a fuel source. While many endurance event oriented persons have varying ratios of macronutrients, often with higher proportions of carbohydrates, some bodybuilders have relied upon high protein (usually at least 1 g per lb of bodyweight) and high fat programs to gain muscle and lose fat. The specific associated training I am thinking of is not heavy weight with one minute or more rest periods between sets, but rather pumping for multiple sets (often 8-15 per bodypart)  with low rest periods (15-30 seconds) for 8-12 repetitions per set as Vince Gironda promoted. This has some cardiovascular benefit as well. "

"Professor Stacy is an eloquent and informative speaker; the video was very much worth watching. I had never heard anyone describe the human rights as ideas rather than something concrete. Of course they are ideas, as they only exist in the minds of those who are aware of them and chose to acknowledge them. It is such a sad state of affairs that the U.S. has not ratified CEDAW. The fact that a small group of ultra-conservatives can hold up something like this is so hard to imagine, unless you look at how this country was founded, which began with colonization by ultra conservatives from Europe. We have never been able to shake that, and it goes along with the development of the Constitution, again written by these white, privileged, conservative males. How does one change or undo what was done so long ago? Getting more women into politics is a tactic, and I think there are some gains being made here, (such as Wendy Davis with her filibuster to try to stop the conservatives from shutting down abortion clinics and severely restricting abortion in Texas) but it is slow going."

"Hi,"
"These are really good points.  Thank you.  I would like to add that it can be not only literal physical survival (though it can be that), but also survival in the community, in the family, in the marriage.  And an interesting thing about culture is that it can work to make what is clearly (in our minds from the outside) unethical seem like an appropriate action."
I have a lot of questions about this.  The first chapter of Outrage to Courage was full.  So many important points made.  A few that really caught my attention included:
"I really like how this interview manages to cover a lot of topics without losing much if any detail within, but there was a point made early on that struck me. It was about human rights mainstreaming feminism, and I don't think I quite got clarity on it. I feel as if (from a standpoint of affecting feminism) the human rights movement is largely neutral because it is oftentimes so broad that it highlights that women are human (obvi) but doesn't really do a good job of articulating the degree to which human rights tragedies disproportionately affect women. So I think that it brings awareness to women's issues, but I don't think I'd agree with the idea that it is mainstreaming feminism. It is (I feel) rather publicizing feminism to a larger base that would be otherwise completely unaware."

All of the Millennium Goals depend either directly or indirectly on improved education of girls and young women:

"The UN's Millennium Goals has one goal that directly pertain to educating women: goal 3.  The goal of this one is to \promote gender equality and empower women\"" and to hope to do so by getting more women educated.  Goal 2 indirectly also pertains to women's education by promoting bother girls and boy's education at primary level.  There are other girls that pertain to maternal/child health such as goals 4 and 5 which have to do with child mortality and and maternal health.  The readings for this week's class suggest that improving women's education will help these goals too therefore they are dependent on goal 3.  Some readings from these past 2 weeks suggest that educating women would also help goal 6, in reducing incidence of HIV/AIDS but Anne has suggested that this may not be the case."

"Hello everyone,"
Goals 2 and 3 relate directly to the education of girls and I do agree with a lot of people here in this group that education for girls is need for their fulfillment; but I'd like to add some words about education in general.
"I fully agree that education is important and crucial to the improvement of the lives of women, but how does education alone help women who are forced into marriage or abusive relationships at a young age. Even with they have the education and resources, they may not be able to get out of that kind of a situation. I suppose, it would be easier for them to leave if they could provide a life from themselves outside of the marriage because of their education. What do others think?"
"Yup, the infographic is an incredibly effective way of presenting key facts and figures to make a point.  It would be interesting to have more infographics on the impact of increased girls' education in different countries.  A problem with the infographics is that they are, purposefully, very simple, which means that we are not able to get a fuller picture of the situation, e.g. what is the quality and content of the education received?  If this is revised to be more gender sensitive, what impact does that have?  I suppose that much of this data has not yet been collected and should be another priority for those working in this sector."

A rouge in the study. Not quite as trackable.  Could they be some fantastic setting where girls ARE learning those marketable skills that the author says are missing from traditional school curricula? Let us not forget that school can totally SUCK! Look at public schooling in the USA. Plenty of healthy, wealthy, white girls think their school days are a drag and would much rather spend their school hours learning a hands on skill than memorizing historical events. A rich, seductive curricula for these adolescent girls is what the key is. Something brilliant that keeps them captivated and clawing through any obstacles to come back for more each day, each year."""

If a government has signed on to CEDAW,  shouldn't there be a form of compensation or income for these groups of women from their husbands or government?"
"Dear Anne,"
"Of course goals #2 and #3 directly relate to girls education as it ensures that boys and girls complete a full course of primary education and promotes gender equality by eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education. While goals # 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment and realization, because they require some level of literacy and basic education to be attained. How can you eradicate poverty, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV, improve sanitation and environmental polices for example if women and girls are not empowered to read and write, participate in leadership decisions, with financial power to make an income and take care of their health? It is wonderful to see all these depend on educating girls and women."

"Hi JamaJack,"
"It certainly is difficult to read about! I have seen patients who have had this procedure. Clinicians who take care of these women must walk gingerly through their care. On the one hand, you want to provide acceptance of them as patients and women, on the other, you want to educate them about what was done and what it means for their reproductive future. I had one patient from Sierra Leone who came to me with the complaint of not feeling pleasure with her partner. On exam I noted that she had been circumcised and most of her labia was sewn together. She had no idea what this \rite\"" had done to her. I felt helpless, as there was very little I could offer her except acceptance. I am horrified to know that this happens to anyone. It can only be stopped as girls/women/communities are educated, and men- how do we make men value women?...I think by putting value on ourselves."""

I think the things that stood out to me the most in this chapter were: 
"Although each one of the eight goals have an impact on or are impacted from a girl's education, I believe that goals 2 - 8 relate directly to a girl's education. Goals 1 - 8 are dependent on educating girls for their fulfillment."
"From my own perspective, if someone doesn't see something as being wrong, there is no way they will welcome change. If the women here  don't see anything wrong in sexual abuse, which is what it is, then chances are there is nothing any international organization or advocacy group can do to make things better. I strongly believe in the shift of mindset through education for the women. In some parts of Africa, many of us women have been thought to see our worth through the eyes of a man. In Nigeria, there is this crazy need to be married by young women, regardless of what the man is about. This marriage frenzy is what has kept many women in abusive relationships simply because they want to be called Mrs. I strongly think that if the mindset of women is worked on, they will then decide for themselves whether a situation is right or wrong, and make more informed decisions simply because they have been empowered. Culture is huge and is integral but we can't tell people their culture is wrong because they will instantly resent you. But we should be looking at empowering women especially in a shift of mindset while respecting their culture. That woman will then be empowered to know that it's best to walk out of an abusive marriage and be alone, than be in it and die either through domestic violence or sexual abuse that may lead to her contracting HIV. Does that mean that her culture won't frown at her decision? Of course they will. But because she is empowered to see herself more than a piece of cloth to be toyed with, it will be easier for her to make informed decisions."
"The problem is posed as, \If we have n data points, what is the probability that a given data point does not appear in *a* bootstrap sample?\"".  I took this to mean in a single bootstrap sample."
"Well, I was not aware that Cyprus signed the treaty and then expressed some objections. After reading the article and the objection of my country I can't say I fully understand the reason behind it. I am not sure whether it's due to the national issues of my country or if ther's a political agenda behind it."
"Female Genital Mutilation takes away so much from a girl, especially any feeling or desire that a woman could have during intercourse. It's what makes her desire a man.  This procedure is done to show the man that she will marry that she is a virgin, waited for the husband, did not stray.  But, this procedure leaves her cold and without excitement or desire.  So, does the husband get multiple partners because she wife is not excitable?"

"The infographics were very helpful in presenting a visual picture to work through all the information. The varying degree of success through out the world is interesting to see. Being a United States citizen, it is very easy to become self absorbed. Most of the information presented was disheartening. I live in the Midwest, where the quality of education is very good and we are sheltered from the reality of many of the problems which are shown by the statistics. How can countries with much less be able to solve the problems and meet the Millennium Goals?  It is a huge challenge."
"Thank you for providing numerous opportunities for deeper thought about the quality of education that girls (and boys) are receiving in the developing world.  I honestly did not give much thought to this piece of the puzzle - assuming that all children going to school were learning to at least basic literacy and numeracy. It concerns me that after breaking down a massive barrier such as even allowing girls to go to school or eradicating tuition, that the outcomes would be so low."
"The idea that one would face discrimination and be denied school is horrible enough...the notion that sending your daughter to school could mean physical or sexual violence or death/harm to your daughter or family is ghastly.  As a mother I would greatly struggle with sending my child to school if I knew this was a risk to my child and family.  I think the fact that people are willing to send their children, in particular daughters to school in these situations speaks volumes to how the citizens value education and education of girls.  Further, how they view education as the tool to stop violent oppression.  I am wondering what the statistics are of parents in the developing world who are afraid or unwilling to send their daughters to primary or secondary school because of fear of violence towards their child or family.  Are their statistics on this? Did I miss this in the readings somewhere?"

The pictorial element of the poster draws the eye and helps in the retention of the information.  I visited the website as well and was dully impressed with the creative and impactful methods leveraged to inform.  I wonder if this type of display of information is a solid global tool - does it pretty much work everywhere and can it communicate in low literacy areas effectively?
This report left me feeling melacholy. On the one hand I was left without any doubt that the key to progress is through girls education. But then the figures on literacy and access to education made me realise just how far we have to go to offer education to girls. I am wondering why there is no research on exactly what ¨¦ducation_is  being received? Is a form of education no matter how colonial better than none at all?

"It unnerves me that the US as the supposed leader of the free world is unable to set a true legitimate example on women's and children's human rights by ratifying the international human rights treaties. What is really the main reason that the US doesn't wish to ratify? Until true incorporation of these treaties becomes a priority in this country, women here will never achieve a true empowerment. It is the recognition of women's power that will open the door to change."
Great Question! I'd also like to know what the most contentious issues were and how that inhibited their efforts.
"I'm a machine learning player in Kaggle platforms. As i do practical problems and use cross validation(CV), my procedure is as follows:"

As I began to ask questions and learn more or grow older in age.For many homes suffer divorce, most husbands forget about their children and move on with their life. As a young African lady, who can relate to communities if this bad treatments are not dealt with properly,and by enlighten girls and women in our community, in school on knowing what their right is the bad treatment will continue. But with giving more knowledge to women and girls it will less the abuse of women and we get gender balance, equal treatment."

"Over the past few years I have found myself doing quite a bit of reading and research around the practice of FGM/cutting and it never ceases to sadden me to the point of tears. The fact that women perpetrate this against girls - usually their own children is awful, but not the most unbelievable part of the practice I have found. The fact that it is mainly done in response to male society - to stop pre-marital sex or for asthetic reasons is mind boggling - surely there are other ways to reach this goal, maybe educating men and boys for example?"

"Whilst I applaud at this attempt to spread the information taking in account the local culture and taboos I, nevertheless, wonder if such \transfer\"" approach is sufficient.

"Reading about this topic was very upsetting for me, and in particular the video that had different women talking about their experience and what they are doing to stop it. Even 30 years after the event you could see that the incident was upsetting the women interviewed and that is was affecting their lives. I assume it is the same for all women that have been cut, so how can they do that to their own children? I was so happy to hear that little Ruth would be safe, and that her mother had such strong opinion on keeping her daughter safe."

"How about this argument: while the distance for LDA may increase, the absolute distance is not so important. Since LDA is based on Normal density functions, the main concern is a new observation's z score. The assumption is that the sigma if the distribution increases as the dimensions increase, so the z score remains the same. Thus, LDA would not suffer as much as KNN from higher dimensionality.     "
"MDGs two and three relate directly to girls education for they seem to promote gender balance (sex balance?)in access, enrollment and completion of certain critical education levels. However, these can only effectively be achieved if the socioeconomic changes suggested by the other six goals are being met. For instance, a study conducted by my organization in one of the regions in Uganda indicated that scarcity of water affected school attendance of boys and girls (but most especially the girls) - promoted by MDG 7. Likewise, studies have indicated that one of the most significant challenge to my country's Universal Primary Education is the high prevalence of poverty (MDG 1), especially in the rural areas. Some parents cannot afford to buy books or pencils for their children to use at school. The same goes for the other MDGs. I would conclude by saying, there is likely to be no single MDG that can be achieved in isolation."
I can't see it either.
I must admit I am a bit behind and am just finishing up the education week.  But in Lloyd's reading I get the impression that a lot of pressure is being put on teacher's and curriculum to enhance the opportunities for women.  It seems to me that teachers are considered primary change agents in this sector.  What does this pressure mean to them? What are practical methods for them to work with parents and community leaders?  I know this is variable to each communities customs and resources available but considering the current divide and hostility between teachers and parents in my country - the USA - it seems like an important question to ask.  How to allow and protect teachers and educational leaders in the process of updating and making relevant both subjects taught and treatment of girls and boys at school?

"I hope I can get some theoretical as well as practical feedback on this. I am trying to use cross-validation to select the best value for a linear regression parameter. The particular linear regression I'm doing is Local L.R. , and the parameter I am trying to \optimize\"" is called the bandwidth parameter (or smoothing parameter). What I do is to run the experiment many times and each run I randomly change the fold assignment of the available measurement (using 5 folds). Number of measurements varies in my experiment between 25-50 measurement of the unknown function I'm trying to recover using local L.R. So, here's what I found so far: if I run this experiment M times, (100-1000), I find that most run give an optimal parameter value that are in a very small interval (they agree on the optimal value), however, a significant portion (about 5% I think) agree on a very different value for that parameter. So one can immediately say that you can't just randomly assign folds to the measurements ONE TIME and go since it appears that there is a dependence on the fold assignment that needs to be \""averaged out\""."

It's also possible that since this is using logistic regression rather than (linear?) regression, the issue lies there - though I don't think so."
"A few years ago, my uncle flew from sea level, the altitude at which he normally lives, up to around 5,000 ft for a business trip. He normally wears contacts for his myopia (nearsightedness), but the following morning, after sleeping overnight at altitude, his sight was significantly improved. The contacts actually made his vision worse. His sight returned to its original state after returning home. I have a feeling that vision change caused by change in altitude is rather uncommon and occurs on a case-to-case basis. I guess it is possible that as interocular pressure equalizes, the shape of the lens changes.  I am unsure whether the pressure in the aqueous humor, vitreous humor, or both would be responsible for such a change."

I suppose it is kind of arbitrary and depends on the context; 20% chance may be small enough to have confidence he or she is in the special-skill group to trust with an investment.

To help athletes prepare for competition in a warmer climate I often prescribe an increase in clothing worn when exercising.

Should we pick the **mtry** parameter using **cross-validation** or **OOB error estimate**? I think cross-validation estimate will be more reliable because OOB error uses only 1/3 of the trees for each observation. [fewer trees => more variance => worse estimate]

Also, the formula for beta above is not quite right."

So many countries value their sons above their girls, and yet a child whose mother can read is 50% more likely to live past the age of 5? When will governments, culture, religious orders, etc. see that, although men and women are of two different sexes, their health are inextricably linked?

"The theory looks clean but the practice is messy. I spent a lifetime doing product development in the food industry.  What we could supply depended on a lot of things; so also what people would buy.  Our objective was always to create products that gave us exclusivity such as by branding, advertising but especially by product attractiveness.  Since capital and lead time was always involved we had a problem of prediction and courage.  How do we apply this nice clean model to the messiness of reality?  Things can get a little tense if your livelihood is involved. What makes it work is that your failures cost you once; your successes can pay for for a lifetime. I see products in the market still making money that I worked on fifty years years ago. The reason for the last two sentences is that risk/reward is a critical factor in the real world.  How do you fit this into a model?"

"How common (and clear to the public) is it that some economic analyses appear to be biased?  You would think economists would fear losing their sense of credibility and legitimacy by taking sides and distorting data in a way that favors their views.

"Are all of you basing your discussion on only the linked article?  Are any of you using the full set of articles or or as The Economist refers to it \report\""?"""
"Hello,"
"The article provides enough detail to use a supply/demand model. However the predictions indicate shifts that require many separate graphs to analyse the relationships for supply/demand, price/quantity. There seems to be little information regarding movements on the curve - or i don't understand movement vs shift."
"In deriving the demand curve from the marginal benefit, the first point is when the price drops to 5, where the consumer buys 1 unit. However, it is stated that the consumer won't buy 2 units until the price drops to 3, which is the marginal benefit of 2 units compared with 1 unit. But it is also stated that the consumer is willing to buy 2 units for $8 so it would seem that if the price dropped to $4 per unit, the consumer would then buy 2 units. Similarly, 3 units would be bought when the price fell to 9.50/3 = $3.17 (rather than 1.50) and so on."
"Though inequality sounds inherently undemocratic (just as Rousseau argued in the Discourse on Inequality that inequality is a form of enslavement), the article shows that inequality itself is not the ultimate problem to be fixed. It can both serve as the incentive for low income people to work harder and increase social mobility (and hence to realize the \American Dream\""). On the other hand, it also prevents many economic and social resources from flowing to the ones who most urgently need them, such as poor people and minority. This seem to me very paradoxical. It can be argued that the more inequality there is, the more incentive people have to work hard and change their fate. Also, more inequality means that it is harder for those unprivileged to succeed, which reduces their incentive to struggle to make a better life."
I think it makes sense that the supply decrease when the price decrease and conversely  the demand increase... however I do not know why this relationship corresponds to a curve and not to a line....
"As one who spent a lifetime developing food products I find these lectures a little strange. They do not conform to my experience of real life. I assume this is because we are discussing models.  A model, of course, is a simplified version of reality. I hope you will get into the issue of fixed costs, which can really warp the behavior of the seller.  Then there are the effects of product quality which can go from no effect as long a minimum standards are met to immense effects if it hits the target of customer preference.  I might add that without a suitable model, numbers become words and thus express opinions; with good models, numbers can be used to forecast the future and become pearls beyond price. Anyhow, I continue to find your class very interesting in that it makes me think."
"This lecture (and the previous one) relies on the underlying assumption that the marginal returns on labour diminish, but it doesn't actually explain why. Great explanation of how the numbers in the table are illustrated by the chart, but no explanation of where the numbers in the table came from in the first place. "
"To build on anishsingh's question below, and oliver's response which I am unsure about."
"Surely the increasing marginal cost is the reason the supply curve's slope gradually tails off (rather than sloping up in a straight line) - not the reason that it trends upwards? The reason it slopes upwards is because of increasing production, no?"
"I too was misled by this question. Sugar is not used in the production of tea, as far as I know. Some consumers may like sugar in their tea so if the price of sugar decreases then they may choose to drink more tea and hence the demand for tea may increase. This seems to represent a external factor in the demand curve for tea, analogous to the change in weather affecting demand for bikes."

"I think there are opportunity costs on both sides - the players and the team owners.

"Hi, "
"Well, I just read the summary of the lecture and saw that it emphasizes the difference between correlation and causality.  I guess I didn't get that from listening to the lecture.  Prof. Taylor referred to disagreements among economists, but didn't provide an example.  Examples are powerful, and I believe that showing the controversy, rather than telling about it, would have been helpful."
"In Nepal, Many industries are shut down due to the cause of politics and trade union. How to explain these phenomenon????"
"In addition to the changes in the education policy, the article recommends a reform agenda that attacks cronyism and invests in the young. I am not sure whether these would give us the outcome that we are aspiring for."
Equilibrium price considered too high. So price ceiling below it.
"You are right about the first and second answers. But the question about the breakeven **price** and the shutdown **price** is different. Think about what was said about what happens to the quantity produced (i.e., the supply) when the price changes ... What does the price equal (or approximate)? Does the quantity stay the same?"
"That makes total sense when we talk about very large scales - I'm quite prepared to believe that when you've already hired the best 2500 people in Cambridge, you're going to start getting less productive programmers if you try to grow further (or, equivalently, you're going to have to invest in training them). But the production curves we have been seeing in the lectures start to rise almost immediately. Going from 4 crates of pumpkins to 5 crates shouldn't have exhausted the town's supply of people strong enough to lift a pumpkin..."
Utility can be used to rank alternative consumption combinations. But can utility also be used to rank an alternative consumption combinations.
I think utility values are arbitrary to a large extent - it is just the relative higher / lower value ratio that matters in determining choice.
I agree this seems like a major omission in the utility table.  Also I am not clear why we are using two fruits to get the demand curve for grapes.  Why do we only need grapes + another fruit? Why not include ice cream?  Maybe bananas + ice cream is much nicer than grapes or grapes + ice cream?
Economics 101
"As what we have learnt in the class, price in a competitive market is set by the equilibrium of marginal benefit(MB) and maginal cost(MC), that is, Price=MB=MC. While for a monopolized market, price is decided by the quantity (intersection of MR and MC), then pointing to the demand curve. What is the logic behind this? Why not the firms in a competive market make decision based on their maginal revevue? If the profit is zero, why do they have to work hard and produce? A further question would be: Why is the price of a house more expensive than that of a bicycle regardless of the demand and supply change?"
Hello Mohamed!
"What if the apples were made freely available? I believe that this would make apples have non-rivalry in consumption. And since the good is free, wouldn't non-excludability be vacuously satisfied as well? (since no one pays for the good, those that don't pay cannot be prevented)."
Thank you! I feel the same way and follow the same logic. That's why it confused me as well. To me the answer just seems to be who is willing to pay the most. (Come to think of it which is not so far from reality as we like to think..)
"What I understood from the video is that we need to add inventory investment, which is the increase in the goods in shelves - the things that were produced, but haven't been sold yet - to calculate GDP."
I have taken all the quiz of the first chapter. However it shows the quiz results of the first quiz only.
I can understand how in a competitive market the price is the result of equal demand and supply (MC).
The website is not letting me access the article and the quiz for this section comes up blank. Will try tomorrow
So can we assume that the firm's short term profitability is achieved when production level surpasses where the MC and ATV curves cross.
Put a small dip on the left-hand side of the marginal cost curve before the upward slope begins. This allows for the possibility of decreasing marginal cost at very low levels of production.What if the marginal cost curve is after the upward slope begins what will happen.

it is the wording not the math that is tricky here..wish that an example was given which used the idea that a positive test is a non response etc...the double negative thing is getting to me.
"My instinct was that something is not right, but I did not feel equipped to determine what it is. It is the first time I have seen such a small CI (usually I see a wide range of values, not so close around the 1 like this). What you say about the CI makes sense ... so it is the fact that 1 is within the CI that is rather odd."
"The last question ( q12 ) in homework 2 asks  **the best way for the authors to interpret the odds ratio of 57.7** (comparing the1.0 mg tesofensine group with the placebo group for the outcome of a weight loss of 10kg or more) for their readers .  Here both options 2 ( The drug increases a person¡¯s odds of losing at least 10kg by 57.7-fold ) & option 3 ( The odds ratio here is highly misleading; thus, **the authors should only** report the odds ratio if they additionally give the readers the unadjusted or adjusted risk ratio ) are correct . Which one chooses is a matter of subjective opinion . Arguments can be given both way . Such questions ( at least in present form ) should best be left for subjective type reasoning & not included in MCQ which is for objective questions . Use of word 'only' ( **..authors should only.. ÿ if ...** ) is the weakest link in whole argument & perhaps sufficient too to weigh the scale in favour of option 2 . **Medical literature is meant to cater to a whole range of readership. All readers of a whole range of Medical Journals can not be bracketed together** . Hence my humble request is to Prof. Kristin<redacted> that for this question also, tolerances be adjusted so that both answers are allowed ."
Thank you;  I am not grasping why the 1st answer is wrong.
"Actually when I read the question, it says "
"I agree, the rounding errors can become quite significant. Being a physicist I find the rounding off in this course quite radical, given that the rounding errors are not taken into consideration. (From the little I have seen, this is unfortunately a usual practice in medical reearch.) I am actually half through the homework, W3, and I cannot decide how to proceed. I know how to give a correct answer, but I am not sure this answer will be regarded as correct."
"With all due respect, I think this question is poorly written. I think we cannot actually know the probability that the hemophiliac would *contract* HIV from a single infusion. I believe we are being asked to determine the probability that the hemophiliac would be *exposed* to HIV from a single infusion. Please let me know if I am misunderstanding."
"Well I can only speak for myself....I read the questions carefully and read the questions again and half my problem when it comes to solving is with the rounding of the answer. I also found the example rounding \x.xx\"" or \""xx.x\"" has not always been accurate. I even ran a few of my answers in my computer program to check my work against the answer given by coursera and 5 out of 10 the coursera answer and the computer answer is off by a degree, so with that said, if a computer program can be off, why is it a complaint if there are a few of us who need more clarification. "

Same thing here:
"For skewed sample data, such as the Vitamin D levels example here, would it ever make sense to measure the median in a number of random samples and then average those? We talked about how the median can be a better representation of the middle of your dataset for skewed distributions in an earlier unit. It doesn't seem like the average median would be the true median in most cases though (although it may be in the ballpark)."

"In module 2 of section 6, the professor discusses how in large studies significant P-values may mask rather small effect sizes. I was wondering if in some cases, especially in the exercise and weight loss study that was described in the module,that even studies with small effect sizes may demonstrate significant population level benefits. A small effect size when applied to millions in the population may prove important.  For example, in the exercise/weight loss study,a small difference in weight gain may represent improved health status for tens of thousands at the population level.  On the other hand, in a study conducted among hospital patients a significant P-value, but small effect size may not translate to any benefits at the population level.  Thus, maybe in some cases a study with a significant P-value but small effect size may have important population level results."

"I am stuck too, my answer for p seems impossible because it is so large."
I'm confused. 
"I have a mundane question. In the videos, she usually states p-values as percentages. Do we use percentages or probability (decimals) for the answers? I hunted around the site and can't find a reference. If we use percentages, do we use the % sign? The instruction that we give our answer to 3 decimal places, thousandths, suggests to me, that we use decimals. Otherwise, it seems excessive compared to the answer to 11.

On Homework Q11 and Q12 from Unit 5 I entered the answer in a percentage format (I multiplied with 100). I did that because during the lecture you presented the p-value as a percentage numerous times. Is it possible to get credit for my answers on these two questions since I believe my answers were correct? Thank you!
"I already submit the homework, and I saw the correct answer in this question in which a z-score of 2.2 was got, but when I look for the area under the curve (in the Z-score table) I don't get the p value you put in the correct answer, the value I got is 0.4821 by using the table in this website: http://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution-table.html"
I've got correct answers.
"Thanks but means that I didn't understand at all this part. If you look at example in the module. When you want to know if vitamin D level is less than 100, you state null hypo = 100 and then try to reject it or not.Then if you reject you accept alternative hypo that says <100."
"This is the first module that made me confused. We need to be told how, exactly, simulation software works? The other thing is that it appears to me that we are telling the software to build date in a way that different means average to the actual mean and then we consider that as an interesting output of the software!"
"I think it talks about how many people were involved. In the simulation the sample size is <zipRedac>0000 + <zipRedac>0000. While in the actual HIV trial, ~8200 + ~8200. No?"

Unit 5 Module 5 Quiz: 
"Just a note that, I feel like this week many of the concepts were illustrated with simulations, but we're expected to answer questions using mathematical formulas, most of which were just barely touched on. I wish that the formulas were focused on more and maybe that can be done for future versions of this course."
I know the excess infection should be Norm distributed with mean 0 for the Null hypothesis. But how to calculate the STE ?std)?
Wondering if this is where you are supposed to count the number of cases (the total is 1000 I think) that fall outside the +/- 3 (2.7) range. Wish this one was multiple choice.
"Can we predict it, since it should be normal distribution. Does it equal to sqrt(p*(1-p)*n)?"
So the null hypothesis is greater than 20% And the alternative hypothesis is less than or equal to 20%. Then how do you compute the p-value assuming the null hypothesis. Cannot use normal or T distribution since they are characterized by mean= value and not mean> value(20% in this case).
"I, too, have a similar question to Simplitia and Lunatique.  How does the software perform this simulation exactly???"
Cause it's not like it's picking purely random numbers and possibly saying in one simulation that all 100 men had d levels above 200 nmol/L.  And how would it know to make its d level results for these virtual men come out right skewed if we only tell the program the mean and SD of d levels???
"Parkinson's law having kicked in, I'm way behind on this course and I don't think I can catch up. Part of the problem is that I can't really take notes while I'm watching the videos because I do it on moving trains and buses using my laptop. Can't write down formulas using the laptop and can't do quick outlines, either. Holding a notebook next to the laptop just doesn't work - my lap's not big enough and neighbors get crowded."
"My dear and polite Teachers - <redacted> and <redacted>, thanks for your answers. You can not imagine how is academically speaking, agreable to read your notes and classes. I have two more questions. Are there in R any packages for doing simulations or it_s neccessary always to write a program? Is there free tutorials about simulations on wwweb?"
"How are you getting 27, and not 2.7= (9 - 6.3)?"
"There were 10,000 studies in the group, but infections are given by 1000 studies. So you get 9-6.3=2.7 infections per 1000, which is 27 by 10,000."

"Cool, thanks for that. But if clinical trials continue to produce the same results over and over again, would it be valid (or is there a method) to combine all the trial data to see if there is any statistical significance?

"Well, although active voice is easier to understand, passive voice may seem more objective isn't it? esp when it is unnecessary to mention the logical subject.

"This leads me to think, and to ask, as far as active and passive voice is concerned, whether it is advisable to vary the style or levels of usage (i.e., formal or informal/ conversational) used in different scientific and technical writings, based on their intended readers or audience. In short, is it correct to say that writings with higher level of formality ( such as those found in peer reviewed journals), should use more passive voice sentences? And conversely, that popular scientific and technical magazines ( with more informal style) should use more active voice sentences?"
I lost a point because I didn't capitalize the first letter of an answer! Isn't that a bit over the top strict? I know the grading system can easily understand such exceptions.
"My question is about 1.4B, but I don't want to start a new thread (I have no error to report).<br/>"

"In Questions 2.3 and 2.4 I answered with strong verbs that are synonyms to the verbs to discuss and to recommend, but both were marked as wrong. Is it possible to change it and make the answers correct."
"I notice in the example of passive and active you changed the noun to verb \activation to actives\"" is that okay to make changes."""
"There may be some cultural difference between the US and UK in the use of the passive voice in spoken, or even conversational, use. As I said in my opening post, I regularly (rather than occasionally) use the passive in conversation and it is not uncommon (apologies for the negative) to hear others do the same. From idle curiosity, I made a rough tally this morning during a one hour news and discussion programme on BBC Radio 4 and around 10% of sentences were in the passive voice (yes, I have too much time on my hands)."
I can understand the principle of using an active voice and writing in the first person but to do so on the basis that readers will otherwise be unwilling or unable to tackle the material seems rather condescending. 
"I've had a quick look at the literature (Berger et al 2007,Nature 447:407-412) and it seems that in response to DNA damage, Sin3/HDAC complex binds H3K4me3 through the PHD domain of the Ing2 protein (So there is physical contact between all the proteins). This recruitment stabilizes the nucleosomes and signals transcriptional repression in the end. The thing is that it seems by the original sentence to be a sequential process which ends up in the recruitment of sin3/HDAC, which is the crucial step to associate H3K4me3 with transcriptional repression instead of gene activation. This subtle nuance is lost in the corrected sentence. But if the author approves the re-write, I guess it will be accurate."
"I echo your views Amy. People may not be interested in (or turned off by) reading highly technically-worded articles because they may say, \It's too technical for me\""; and thus, find the information exclusive only to the experts in the field.

Hi Nuria!!
"As I said above, for native speaker with a strong background in medicine/biology might be easy to re-write/edit a sentence without understanding it.

(a pitfall in the experimental methods or in the interpretation of the data, for example). Should you submit it as an \""original paper\"" even if you are not communicating an original research?"""
"For writing assignment 2 I am planning on re-writing an introduction from one of my earlier publications. I would like to remain relatively anonymous, and I can't do that if I include the citations."
so do we need to use first person to refer to the authors when rewriting?
"Should we use our real names in Essay 2, or should the reviews, letters, etc. be written using fictional names?"
Are peer reviews intended to be double-blind (as in Essay 1) or are they intended to be single-blind?
"Hello everyone,"
"O do have such a question as Karin - if I had to \include the original introduction and then add my revised introduction so the peer reviewer can see what changes I have made\"" "
"My answer to above mentioned quiz was not b& c but I first answered (c) which was marked wrong then in II attempt I answered (b) which is a whole number, which was again marked wrong. Both are correct according to content matter of the video."

Hello!

"Today as I was checking peer reviews, I came across 'ageing', I looked it up in a dictionary to see if this could be correct. What is the standard for using British or American English spelling and some prepositions? I live abroad and teach more British English but what about publishing, is it dependant on the journal?"
Dear Teacher
"Thanks for your reply, Dr. <redacted>. I went through the Unit 6, lecture 1 where you talk about systematic reviews and I found that pretty helpful. The 'Background and Unknown' bits of the introduction are easy to write, but what I find challenging was the last paragraph where I have to explain what I am really doing in the article. Would you recommend writing the last paragraph in a way that gives a short outline of the article and the information that each section contains? I saw some reviews from this journal and they seem to have pretty varied style of introduction. "
"Dear Colleagues,"
Hi Kristin
"Thank you all for reviewing my essays. I've always found your comments very useful. However, my essay for the writing assignment 2 seems to have an incorrect grading. One of the graders has listed the essay as \incomplete 0/3\"". I would like to know if this was inadvertent, or if my essay really lacked clarity."
"One of my reviewers nabbed me for plagiarism - but it was my own paper, with the introduction rewritten - except for final two sentences - both of which were very clear and needed no revision. "

"I was considering the advice that a string of seven to ten words should be unique in the Googleverse to be unplagiarised, in the light of my recent discovery that some organisations, such as the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) have actually got officially defined glossary, the terms from which you are recommended to use in IPCC-relevant papers.  This is clearly necessary for such an international audience, which borders with politics and the public.  However, some of these are 4 words long, and you might need more than one in a phrase. Surely this increases the probability of false plagiarism flagging?"
Hi Tia
"So, in my research area - software computing - the papers have a feature or characterstic that the last paragraph in the introduction section looks something like this: \This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews [content]. Section 3 presents [contet]. [content] is introduced in Section 4, followed by a discussion in Section 5. The paper is concluded in Section 6 with a brief statement on proposed future directions."
"I sent my first assignment as assignment 3, so of course there are similarities in the text, I just edited it. I'm very curious about the reason for the flagging... Thank you for answering!"
"This is a very good qustion. I hope we could have some thoughts from Dr. <redacted>. Personally, I think judged by the guidance of the courses, many titles are not good, such as \the role of protein A in regulating process B\"", what does it actually say? Nothing..."""
Question 2.3:
<zipRedac>5 per <zipRedac>0000 / year is not informative and sounds to me that it is not a lot. Like you said only a few women will benefit form taking that drug. But saying that there is a risk that 30 women / <zipRedac>0000 / year may develop cancer. To reduce this risk by 50% you might want to / should take that drug. That is something more concrete.

Dear JOsh
It seems that others are asking a related question:
to be honest I think the way they presented the data is a bit confusing.
"I think it should be 6 as you have 6 discordant pairs. Again, not sure if that is the correct way so waiting for Josh to chip in."
I'm equally confused now as you Lido.I watched this video over and over again. In fact I'm late for work cos of that! I don't want to spill out the formula just like this but just to make everybody on the same page. I calculate the probability for X=5 and X=1 so 6C5 and 6C1  (they are essentially the same) and add them together to get a two sided p value.

"The new fad in our district (as others) is to group and re-group based on who is struggling with what ideas at the time... the assumption being that flexible and non-permanent grouping avoids the negatives of tracking.

One question I would like to know what's everybody's idea is that do you believe that in high school we should place students in the right level math class?

To register for each math class depends student & their parents, there is no qualification requested. Therefore a lot time in my grade 9/10 academic/university level course students only have grade 5/6 level of basic math skill. I find that it is very difficult for me to engage them, they feel bad and lost most of the time. I often to suggest them to take one level lower to start then later to come back to high level mat class. I am not sure if I am doing the right thing or there will have some other ways I can teach them better....Looking forward to hearing your thoughts."

"My first impression? I don't get it. I don't have a conceptual understanding of math as I was taught procedurally. I was taught to manipulate formulas and to use algorithms with little explanation, and there little understanding on my part, of math conceptually. That's what I lack. So this idea that all math comes down to number sense seems logical to me but I don't see how that works. I can believe it's so but I don't understand how it's so."
I made a mistake on mine.  I submitted it and then realized my mistake.  Can't get it to reset so I can fix it.  I know mistakes are supposed to be good and my brain grew..But it doesn't feel real great.  I kind of feel stupid that I am the teacher and messed it up.
"I really like the idea of mixed grouping. However, I struggled when the mixed grouping is rather a mixed of kids from different economic backgrounds. I am still trying to work this out in my classroom, but it is clear that kids from high economical status have so much more access to different learning experiences outside school. These experiences can make such an impact in the way kids interact with each other. Teachers need to teach students to share their own learning experiences in a way that is beneficial for all without putting down others. There is a lot of work in the beginning of the year around teaching healthy interactions among students I think, especially in the middle school ages. This teaching is key for building a healthy environment for all students to feel safe to express themselves and their experiences and learn from each another. Do you have any strategies that work for teaching social skills to students to interact to one another?"
"As I sit here thinking about a mixed group that Jo refers to (not tracking) - I hear the message that ones withing the class are assigned different assignments, etc. That seems to be \tracking\"" within the classroom similar to reading groups so often in elementary.  Are the groups already mixed in ability - yet why assignments are different?  Won;t the students till feel like they are not doing as well in the \""extra assessments?\"""

yes you make sense! This was not the best demonstration of number talk but the enthusiasm of the teacher was great.
"As a First Grade Teacher, children love to write the teacher notes. I would use this love for writing to create a Big Book (also loved by First Graders) of little Mistakes.  The students (and myself) will write the mistakes we have made and the thinking process of how we took that mistake and created something new. I'll introduce it as ART.  Sometimes we are painting or drawing a picture and we 'think' we made a mistake.  However, once we stop and look at the mistake, it gives us a new and better idea. Suddenly, we celebrate that the 'mistake' happened because it took us to a better place."
"At the beginning of the year, to show my students just how important mistakes are to the learning process, I am considering filming myself trying something new. With each take, I hope to get better (though sometimes I will probably not). I may also do this live in class on the first day. I may try to build something in class or I may ask the students to build something that cannot possibly be built correctly on the first try. It is the challenge of learning from each mistake and persistence that will allow the students and myself to eventually succeed and learn a great deal about ourselves and the project in the course of this activity. Anyone have any ideas for what I could try or what they might build?"
"Our brain is a muscle that gets stronger when we think, struggle, and reflect on our mistakes."

Where I teach the system of assessment is school based. There are no required subjects so students of mixed abilities are together in many classes especially non-mathematics classes. In mathematics the students (still choose it even though not required) self select into the levels that junior high school (other schools attended before they reach mine) has determined they have reached. Those who select upwards fail ; this is principally because they have not got the background to succeed even with the will to try and extra help as assessment is high stakes for each semester of the two years of senior high school. Suggestions for working within this system?
Why do we even have teachers who are not competent in the material they are teaching? Is there something wrong in the way we hire teachers?
"I am not a teacher yet-- I am one semester away from student teaching. I have been shadowing my cooperating teacher, who is a 5th grade teacher. There are 2 other 5th grade teachers with whom she meets with to plan, collaborate, and discuss classroom lessons and issues. The meeting that they had this past week was about using test data to group students on math abilities in order to really help those kids. These ability grouping sessions would take place for about an hour, 3 times a week. They emphasized that these groups would be flexible-- students will be able to move throughout the groups. Do you still think this kind of attention would be detrimental? I definitely understand that students may pick up on the groupings and feel the stigma of their group, but other than these three hours of the week, the students are constantly working in heterogeneous groups, which I agree is so beneficial. I was just wondering if it is ever okay to use *some* *flexible* ability grouping or if it really should be avoided at all costs?"
"Ok so in session 6, I couldn't do any of the first 3 problems (turkey slices- i couldn't come up with an answer because i didn't draw/ration cards-i did not even understand that one- and the painted house i divided the time they each spent painting by 2 and added that thinking that their effort would just be split in two but got it wrong)."
"Still having problems with peer assessment.  I go to the Assessment Panel, it tells me I have peer assessments I need to complete, but for three days I keep getting the same message: server problem, module not available.  Also, when checking my progress, I have responded to several of my peers who have \graded\"" my submissions.  Those responses were \""submitted\"" but they do not show at all. I tried writing them again, and resubmitting, but they still disappear. I know this is a work in progress, but this is frustrating.  I appreciate any help/advice you can give."""

"Do you have any intervention strategies, maybe an additional period of support class, for those lower kids?  We've found it very helpful, for a quarter of the year, to have a pre-teaching and re-teaching class and along with that, some instruction on filling in gaps the kids bring with them."
"I, too, am struggling with this.  At grade 6, recently moved back to elementary in our district, math teachers get pressure from parents of high performing mathematicians to push them into pre-algebra (which had been provided at middle school for those who qualified in gr. 6).  I am just not sure I can do this as effectively if I do not split my two math classes into two groups.  I need to ponder this, as I have run different reading groupings (leveled reading materials - same standards & high level discussions) when I taught gr. 4.  Any suggestions?"

"Hi I have done question 2.3 twice already. The second time I made sure I submitted and did the peer review, my wife watched me do it. Is there anyone else who has had that problem? Can you please tell me if I should do it again or is it just not registering as done?"
I went through and completed all of my tasks and watched all of the videos for entry 1 yet it shows that I made no progress on the course progress page.  Also I am not sure why it says that I can not grade other peoples work and when I try to click to do that it says I can't.

**TWO QUESTIONS: 
"Speaking of bugs, I can not get session 8 to play.  I did session 7 on Saturday, Sept. 14, but that evenin g I could not see any videos for session 8.  Not today, the 15th either.  So I have been doing the rest of my peer grading.  But I am frustrated that all I get for session is videos is a blank black screen.  My guess is that, since it is the weekend, and getting toward the end of the time for the course, the server or system is too over crowded and will not respond.  Hope it resolves soon.  the weekend is the best time for me to do the class, as for all teachers."
"Session I assignments, still aren't being recorded accurately, several 0's given."
"I really didn't understand a portion of the video when the instructor said, \And, in fact some, of the students who completed all 50 questions correctly were those who indicated the most severe anxiety. Talking about being scared, when they were asked to take the test.\"""
"I was surprised that Cathy accepted an incorrect response and recorded it for all to see on the board. One of the students correctly identified the distributive property but when asked how to write it, she accepted 25(29+1) which is used if multiplying 25x30. I believe it should have been 25(30-1) which is for 25x29, the original problem."
"Does anyone understand how we are supposed to review our peer submissions to question 1.3b (What are similar other messages that you think students hear? Or maybe you heard as a learner?). I've read a number of responses, but it doesn't seem to be registered by the system. I've read the scoring instructions, but what I am supposed to do is unclear."
I am confused.  I completed session one.  The Assessment Panel has a yellow exclamation mark that says I have more work to do.  I am not sure what to do?  Can someone help?
"Is that what happened?  Very discouraging.  Who can reverse this? In one place, it says this course ends tonight and in another, it says the 28th.   Please fix it so we can get our credit this evening."
"I am really enjoying this course, and the only real problem I have with it is the peer grading. I am doing my part but it appears hardly anyone else is. I still have a question from the first session I did weeks ago that has not been graded. As a result, even though I have completed all the work, my progress is low. And I really want to complete the course. It is unfair that this is holding things up. There are 4 to 5 thousand submissions that have not been peer graded on a couple of questions. What can you do to resolve this?"
I found the second problem confusing!
"I have graded over 70, there are still 1000's to grade. I am sure others are grading too. How come there appears to be about 600 or so in class, yet over 3000 responses in each category. Why so many? Also one day one of mine said being graded currently, then says needs to be graded. Has anyone actually received any feedback yet?"
Completed session1 (2 hours) and there is NO work saved. Progress says 0/8. Assessment panel says I have NO work submitted. Scrolled through bar under the course and there is none of my writing saved!! HELP :) I am using CHROME. Do i need to do session 1 over again?
I still have five items that are marked as 0/1 (ungraded) which are NOT peer review problems.

I can get back to it if I return to that Session - I did submit it, but I don't seem able to resubmit it and it's not showing up in my progress list nor in the Peer Feedback section.

My guess as to why there was no control in his legs and fingers was decreased blood flow. I had no idea it had to do with different muscle types being used. I'm wondering if supplementing with CoQ10 has an effect on the Q10 effect.
"I am just wondering for a person lost in the mountains of snow which one would be better to increase the survival time: To walk at a low pace to increase the muscle activities and produce more internal heat or to stay in the best possible, least cold / windy-snowy area to reserve the remaining core body heat and energy?"
I have always wondered why is it that when I am cool and sedentary then i get up and do something i get colder. I am also curious on why something like eating a bowl of cereal when you're cool can sometimes make one's self colder? Is it because of warmer blood going to other internal parts of your body? but if it is why would you get colder if it is still circulating in your core?
"Very interesting about the Raynaud's. I have had Raynaud's for about 35 years.

I wonder Why the head is the main source of heat loss?
Have you recently begun taking any different blood pressure medications or blood circulation medications?

"people who were near freezing, report feeling sleepy, cozy and warm."
"This triggers the question... how long will it take for an average person to get used to colder temperatures? Are we looking at years, or rather at a couple of weeks or months?"
"while riding the bicycle (or doing any other endurance activity) during winter months people are inhaling a lot of cold air (VO2 for keeping up acitivity). probably it is reducing core temperature and irritating mucosal layers (vasoconstriction). what role does this play regarding performance and are there any options to decrease negative influences (wearing masks, ...)?"
"\An appropriate training stimulus of high enough intensity will increase your VO2 max. For a given sub-maximum work load after training you will still need about the same amount of oxygen. The difference will be that you will be able to do more work and consume more total oxygen at maximum capacity.\"" "

"One if the videos suggested directing heat to specific areas, face, armpits and hands I think."
"skipped past the mini-lecture questions for the first few videos without even knowing it, only realized when I went to the progress screen.  UI is very non-intuitive that there's a second screen hiding there.  The icons at the top make it look like you'd be changing the layout of the video screen, not going to new ccontent."
"By using a treadmill after the cold water soak, wouldn't those leg muscle fibers tear easier?"
Would there be a reason why there is no sound from the video?
It shows that there is a video 3 and so forth.  How do I get to these videos?
"How come the progress doesn't equal to the actual participation? I watched all videos, passes all tests but the progress bar doesn't reflect?"
I totally agree. I had no idea the number of risk factors for hyperthermia.
"I didn't know about Fick's principle until now. It is so fascinating to find a mathematical equation describing, even if only in numerical terms, such a complex physiological process!"
I will be going to Tibet next year and currently live in Australia.  A question that came to me while going through the module is are we more likely to get hypothermia when going to higher altitudes especially if the body is not used it and how can you prefer your body for this without going to higher altitude locations?  I know that there is going to be a model on this but just am curious in relations to hypothermia.  
I found it interesting that the onset of hypothermia and temperature reduction is 25 or more times quicker in water than air and yet it seemed from the initial video that Corey's core temperature seemed to remain a lot higher during his time in the bath than it did on the treadmill. Did anyone else find that odd? Perhaps I just need to watch the next couple of videos to find out why.
"I am loving this course! As a health science student and personal trainer I'm finding the information very relevant and explained at a level that builds upon my current knowledge of anatomy and physiology, but I can not seem to start the videos from different places in the lecture. I wanted to review and study the Fick equation more because it went by pretty quickly in the lecture, but each time I cued the video to the slide where  Dr. Friedlander explains how the equation works, the video restarted from the beginning when I hit play. Is there a trick so I can re-watch sections of the lecture without starting from the beginning?"
Hi! I made the same mistake and had lost the opportunity to respond to some questions ; D
What specific nonoxidative sources does the body use to do work when a given individual reaches their VO2 max?
I was really surprised when I saw the Story video. I thought Corey would get warm soon after he got on the treadmill but it's actually exactly the opposite! I think this may due to circulation?
"Corey, this may sound like a simpleton question. From the time I was a keiki (kid in Hawaiian), my mom told me to cool down and cover up after exercise or fitness activities. Is it true that you can still be at risk for hypothermia if your body temperature drops drastically & quickly even if the temperature is really warm or even hot around you? For instance after working out, I know an improper cool-down risks the pooling of blood. However, does not doing a proper cool-down and covering up the sweaty body make you more susceptible to hypothermia?"
"Secondary to Q1, the video mentioned that there doesn't seem to be any proof of a material benefit of this response, so why do we habituate this way?"
"When you feel \dead-tired\"" your muscles are not actually at their limits. It's just that your brain tells you that you are dead-tired probably as a means of self protection from the possible effects of overexertion."
"They are quite possibly efficient uncouplers... which makes for an inefficient metabolism, right?"
"So, if i have it right women are more vulnerable to heat loss than men due to their larger surface-area/mass ratio, but less vulnerable in some cases do to a better (more uniform?) distribution of subcutaneous fat. How does that play out in extreme conditions? Old experiments are said to have shown that women can withstand freezing conditions longer than men. Is that likely to be a psychological difference?"
I am wondering if their is a positive role for hyperbaric oxygenation in the immediate post-hypothermia period to the benefit of recovery time. 
"I was reading this on Silbernagl & Despopulous Atlas of Physiology and Guyton's Medical Physiology. Well, Guyton says it takes a few weeks to adapt to cold, and Silbernagl says it takes years to adapt to hot tropical places. Yet professor said there are more resources to adapt to hot than to cold weather, since we're tropical animals. "
"There was no discussion of the use of ice baths for muscle recovery.  The theory, I think, is that the blood constriction induced by the cold helps the muscles clear lactate, in a somewhat similar way to massage.  I know little about the science, but it is clearly used by athletes and I have tried it and seen benefits.  What is going on?"

"Hello colleagues, the brown adipose tissue is very interesting.  I had no knowledge that we could have brown adipose tissue."
"Thanks for trying to clarify! I agree with you that the quantity described by the Fick equation - VO2 - is impacted by training and health. I know this by own experience ... But as it is written it seems to me a question about the validity of the Fick equation for untrained and trained people. I mean VO2 is impacted by training and health, but not the Fick equation. The equation is valid independent of your fitness and health. But maybe the question refers to VO2. H, this was my doubt."
"I am not sure that I understand what the benefit of increasing BAT would be for a normal performance.  As you said, energy pathways are less efficient and not good for exercise, so what would be the purpose to try to increase BAT performance wise.  Would it to just be able to tolerate the cold better and not become hypothermic as soon?"

I'm also very prone to heat exhaustions/heat strokes and have ended up in the medics' tent more than once at a race. Obviously, my excessive sweating leads to dehydration which causes the heat exhaustion. But what I'm somewhat confused about is that the sweating seems to decrease somewhat when I'm fitter. This seems to contradict some (folklore?) statements that I've heard that one sweats more with increased fitness. "

"I wonder whether the VO2 output is affected by old age, say, above, 60 ,even without being affected by extreme cold."
The temperature to evaporate water is about 100 ¡ãC.
"Hello,"
I think the key to understand this is to think about the expected test MSE E(MSEtest). 
Section 2.1.2 of the book seems to suggest that the level of fit on a flexible model is determined by the degree of smoothness.  No mention is made about the effect of sample size on fit (other than a large amount of data is needed).  The 'shown answer' seems like something that cannot be determined from Chapter 2.
Hello.
"Most athletic events involve competition against others.  As such, knowing, for example, that sprinters do better in warmer temperatures is not particularly valuable.  What would be valuable is a method to determine your improvement is more relative to the competition.  I suspect that I perform better relative to competition in cooler weather.  Are there any studies on what provides an advantage in one individual over another in adverse environments?"

I couldn't agree more. Education is a strong factor. As the book talks about most women living in underdeveloped areas lack education. Some are completely illiterate. If they can't read well then there is a good chance that they do not know their human rights as women. Especially in certain countries that regulate what can be seen or even read in their own countries...example North Korea. This makes it very frustrating because how can we educate these women where the country is so corrupt?
"I'm left thinking about the implications of a shift from a \development\"" lens to \""human rights\"" lens. Is this shift largely academic/intellectual, or logistical? In a practical sense, are there any goals emphasized by a development frame that take a back-seat from the HR POV?

"The confusion comes from the slide 7 of the lecture, where it is stated that \with 95% probability, the range will contain the true unknown value of the parameter\"". This can be understood as the value belongs to the range with that probability since the range is computed by the specific formula. I think it is not stressed enough during the lecture the real meaning of the confidence interval. Moreover, professor Tibshirani said: \""if you want a confidence interval of 95%, we take the estimate of our slope plus or minus twice the estimate of the standard error.

Firstly I think in many developing countries girls are allowed to attend school until there is something more important (or what is considered more important by the family) for her to do be that marriage or working in the fields. And that is why she drops out. And it is because families (natal and in law) do not see the value of education past basic literacy that they drop out. She can read ...what else does she need. Also in places like India where there is dowry, the younger a girl is at marriage the less dowry the family has to pay, so some girls are married off at 4-5 years of age, usually when her older sister or cousin is also marrying. Then she stays with her family until her menses (12-14 years) arrive after which she is sent to live as a real wife. So yes, dropping our and early marriage and childbearing are related, but it is a bit of a chicken and egg business (which comes first) driven by the lack of value of the girl and of education itself. "
"Hi Andreia. I completely agree with your first point. Early marriage and girls dropout of school is a kind of vicious circle and it_s difficult to see what it_s first. My point is that maybe statistics don_t take into account the full complexity of this problem and they are just taking into account what it_s happening first. If you ask a girl \what was first? dropping out school of getting married?\"", this kind of question is not completely meaningful if you don_t find out other factors, the familiar context, etc..."

And what can we do about it? The problem is the culture and what is seen as \good\"" or \""bad\"" as well as what makes a child rewarding and beneficial to the family.

"This is a comment on the section on stress.  I could not find another place to put it- Would anyone else have appreciated a Glossary on this section, like there was on the last one?"
"Are some people genetically more predisposed to stress? I used to live in South India, where life is still at a much slower pace than it is in North India, where I live now. I find that people are very stressed out here, road rage is common, people get attacked & killed for parking in the wrong place...on the whole it is a much more stressed out place than South India."
"same here, I can see piazza but nothing on week 3 coursework, would have been nice to have access on Friday to allow me to work on the course on the weekend."
"I've heard & read so much about relaxation, but I never really knew what went on in our body during stress & during relaxation."
"Hi all. I'm very glad to participate this course. I saw that we can download de full video of each class. Is it possible to release also the captions? If is, how?"
On the courseware tab I can only access Chapters 1 - 4. No Chapter 5 onwards?
"Since LDA/QDA require multivariate normality among the predictors, I am wondering how often this is useable in practice.  My work is in biostatistics where predictor variables are more often than not categorical.  So in my field, is this ever are viable option?"
"same here, it's not there :("
"Don't think so, can't see it neither..."
"Hi! Week 3 is not available for me.... please, would you be so kind to check it out? Many thanks"
"I don't really understand how MSE would be used to predict categorical variables. For the binomial case for instance, all our outcomes are 0 and 1 - not the probability of a 0 or a 1 (unless we repeat the experiment with exactly the same inputs several times), but just 0 or 1, for each combination of inputs. It makes all the sense to try to predict the probability of the outcome, and to minimise the discrepancy from observations given by a particular model - which is exactly what the ML function is. This is what makes intuitive sense to me, at least."
How are the grading points allocated across questions and subquestions in HW 2?
"AlanX, I think you're right, I think it has to do with the contrasts you are interested in."
"I really enjoyed the theme for week 2. Education can really change women's lives, specially in developing countries."
Do you have just one data point for each country?
"In the simplified LOOCV formula for linear and polynomial regression using leverages hi topic(Lec 5.2), is there a simplified formula for classification problems?"
"I've heard that part of the fight or flight response is to reduce body weight be evacuating solid and liquid waste. Conversely, distance runners know that the physical stress of a long run suppresses kidney function. Apart from the fact of not needing the loo during a long run, distance runners in hard training tend to develop dark shadows under their eyes and this has been attributed to reduced waste excretion."
"We try so hard to manage negative stressors in our lives.  But, should we think about managing positive stressors as well?  Is stress just stress?"
Does it mean : will include purely the interaction unless the main effects are already included in the . ?
"I wonder how much public speaking stress has to do with our preparation or venue? I too have done some public speaking. Both as a person delivering a topic, or just asking a question during a public governmental meeting.  It's interesting to note that many times I will \feel fine\"", but as soon as the microphone gets to me to ask the question, I find myself breaking out in a sweat and turning red.  Or while delivering a topic, I'll be nervous until I start, then it seems all down hill (easy.)"""
"anonymous, I don't know how this is done - but how would you do it, if you had to invent your own method?"
"For parts d,e,f - I am just using a formula to calculate the probability. Is there any catch, since the same question is being asked with different values?"
"Due to life priorities and conflicts, I have found that I am already falling a little behind in the coursework.   I am very interested in taking this course fully and doing all the quizes and learning checks at the end of the modules and have been plugging along at my own pace as I can fit it in.   I am wondering, since there is a start and end date to the class, does that means that you need to have completed all of the coursework (quizzes and learning checks) by the \End\"" of the course to receive \""With Distinction\"" or \""statement of accomplishment\"" or can we finish up at our own pace?   Please let me know."""
This report was wonderful.  I think this should be a handout for girl's in school.
"Hi,"
How can someone combat bad decisions when facing moderate hypothermia? In the case of someone being on their own that is. 
"I just finished the Module on Bone Density loss. It was mentioned that lower estrogen will increase the rate of bone loss. It so happens during breast feeding, estrogen levels are lowered. Does anyone know if this impacts the bone density of the mother permanently and if the duration of breastfeeding play an important factor. I believe the age of the Mother may also have an impact? Is an older mother more at risk of bone density loss than someone who is younger if she practice breast feeding?"
"Yes, I'd also be interested to know. In addition, I have trouble logging into piazza."
I am trying to find week 3 because my information is stuck at week 2 . I have located my group but have no information to move forward...smile
"> Is it just me, or do the questions in a lot of these quizzes bear very little relationship with the course lectures and/or text?"
"It seems to me that well-trained martial artists show signs of arousal of both the SNS and the PNS when they're confronted.  They have a loss of appetite, pain, etc.; increased arousal; and **probably** an increased blood supply to the limbs and CNS (SNS). They also exhibit increased focus, reduced breathing, and relaxation (PNS)."
Shouldn't it be page 9 rather than 8?
"Dear All,"
"This question is for Corey. What is the name of the probe and feedback application used in the stress relaxation video? I would really like to check that out. Thanks, Corey. Disregard. I found it. For anyone else interested, eh link is below."

I have the same question.
I just finished the quiz for week 3 - FGM. 
"I have always heard that you can't use the ordinary diving chart to calculate diving times, decompresion stops and surface times when diving at high altitude. It makes sense but until today I haven't thought about why."
"In the Altitude Module 5 there seems to be a slide missing (or perhaps just miss numbered?) concerning Chronic Adaption (Week/Months) it jumps from 1. Blood changes continue, to 3. Minimize diffusion distance in tissues. Best, <nameRedac_<anon_screen_name_redacted>>"
I'm not getting the data to appear either.
For some reason I can't post on the piazza for Week 3?
"Susanj, I got that question wrong (I think right) and have posted a request for clarification. "
Same problems
I have trouble assessing the discussion.
when and where are the office hours?
same problem with accessing Piazza. We were not given accounts and when I try to log in with my email address and the password I usually use for the course it does not recognize me at all. That is making commenting on the two readings quite difficult for the SoA....thanks in advance!

"From all the about blood changes and how over time in a high altitude, it raises your hematocrit. Low hematocrit can be a key factor in anemia. Have there been any experiments putting people with stubborn or genetic anemia n high altitudes for extended period of time to see if it might help them?"
"Hello,"
same. I tried to log into Piazza but it requires a Stanford email...not sure if someone is addressing this.
One of the things I thought about as I was going through the R exercises for using LDA to predict Smarkets direction is that one does not have to trade every day.  If you could understand which days represent situations that are really set up for up days (or down days) then you could keep your powder dry until one of those days happened to come by and then pounce on the opportunity.
"Ok, I have to ask because I don't see it anywhere. What are the little blue alarm clocks on the sides of the lectures each week?"

I had the same problem so I contacted Piazza. You need a class access code from the instructor. Another thread says they are working on the issue

"Perhaps this will be answered in later lectures, but I can't help but wonder to what extent we can train ourselves to interpret stimuli in a favorable way.  I would love to have seen the heart rate and skin conductivity data for the jumper strapped to Dr. Friedlander.  Can repeatedly subjecting ourselves to a stimulus that may innately induce a stress response (like falling out of an airplane), cause an adaptation that allows us to interpret the stimulus in a different and perhaps more beneficial way?"

"This course has mainly been focusing on short term adaptations but I'm curious, what about people who spend months, years, even their whole lives in extremely cold/hot or high altitude places?  How far does adaptation go?  I feel like there are 2 levels of adaptation: behavioral (putting on warm clothes), physiological (increased heart rate).  Is there a third level, the cellular level where genetics come in to the mix?  Are there certain genes that allow you to adjust to or live at high altitudes?"

The article would have never drawn my attention had I not been taking this course... :) I certainly am not knowledgeable enough to make any sensible comment, but putting aside the latter part of article about \p-hacking\"", while the article focuses on p-value, if I am not mistaken, wouldn't it be possibly due to more of adequacy of designing statistical models, including things such as constructing adequate hypotheses, possible overfitting, wide gap between training MSE and test MSE, etc., because p-value appears an outcome out of those...? Or is it indeed the validity or \""misuse\"" of p-value as mentioend in the article..? It would be great to have some comments from the professors and/or TAs."""
Anne talked about the people she brought to Pike's Peak and the fact that she expected AMS to hit them after they'd been up there awhile.  Does anyone know why it doesn't occur immediately?  Thanks!

"Hi.. I fly aerobatics in competition, and we regularly do +9 or 10G, and -5 or 6 (some very good pilots do even more).  But we only hold these for a very short time (we don't wear G suits).  Also, we train for this, starting at lower Gs and steadily increasing.  My question is:  we've all experienced grey-outs, but once I lost my hearing first.  In fact, I thought my engine had failed as everything went quiet.  But then I realized that the plane was fine, and I was holding the stick back in a tight bank.  As soon as I released the stick my hearing returned.  Why did this happen (I've never had it since)?"

Firstly Thank you to the team I really enjoyed this course and it has encouraged me to take other on line courses and further my knowledge.
How long will it take to have the certificates sent out?
Thank you for the NCSS document. I continue to be curious why this method is called Ridge Regression. Also curious why Lasso is called as such. Only a curiosity on my part. 
The models presented in chapter 6 use least squares fit either directly or with constraint. Least squares fit assumes the error in the data are independent and identically distributed as Gaussian. It also assumes the X variables are fixed and do not vary. I think we have held to these assumptions so far in our studies. Am I correct in thinking this?

For example, LDA is more stable than Logistic Regression when classes are well separated and if n is small and the distribution of the predictors are approximately normal for each class (pg.138).

Regression Splines are more stable than Polynomial Regression as it reduces the need for high degree transformations of X by increasing the number of knots (pg.276)"

A little over three years ago, my friend and I went up to the mountains somewhere near the Sonora area. It was relatively high altitude (compared to where I live) and it was freezing cold. My friend got our snowmobile stuck in a snow embankment along one of the trails and we were not too close to help. Seeing that using our hands wouldn't do much of a good job removing the huge amounts of snow around the snowmobile, I decided to walk and look for help. Fortunately, I found some individuals who were at their vacation home and they had a strong snowmobile that was able to pull ours out of the snow easily. Because we had not returned to the snowmobile rental place, they had a relatively decent idea where we would be and were going to send help. Just then, we returned.

"I still have not seen a quiz for Week 5.  Additionally, I do not see any record of discussions or reflections that I have posted in piazza.  I have not seen responses to this from the team so likely will not be able to receive a statement of accomplishment, which is disappointing.  However, I am enjoying the class."

I did the same but I still have the wrong answer. I changed the seed to avoid generating similar random points.

"I got within 10% of the correct response on question 10.R.2, but I did not get the exact same numbers. Would it be possible to briefly sketch (in the answer explanation) the path used to get to the official answer ?"
no... that did not work...

"I have a similar issue: Win 7, Firefox: I would stretch my browser across my two monitors then hit the double-box icon to enlarge the video. By stretching like this, the enlarged video would center align far enough to the left that the closed caption had plenty of black margin space to the right of the video to display without blocking the video.

"How long, after the end of the session, will these lectures and the labs remain accessible? I'd like to revisit a few when I have a bit more time..."
It was a great course for introduction to a lot of modern techniques to statistical learning.  Will there be a more in-depth class that follow the Elements of Statistical Learning book?

Are we provided with the certificate after completion of course
"Related thought. I'm thinking that a diver swimming downwards doesn't get that upside down feeling either. The diver is supported by the water buoyancy acting in the opposite direction from gravity.

"Let me add my thanks.  A couple of suggestions.  I'd love another course. Specifically, I envision a survey of methods (logistics, random forests, knn, etc) and illustrations of the kinds of problems best and worst suited for each.  I imagine several data sets and each method is applied (if vaguely appropriate) so the results can be compared.  "

"How do you participate in group meetings? I checked course info tab, courseware sections, and discussion forums, but I do not see any group meeting listings. Are these group meetings something you would have to form on your own with your classmates?"
Hello! I have a question:
Hi!
"I had no problem with the SVM, in theory, but then, after simulating for as many experiments as suggested here (1000), I expected to nail the correct percentages down to within 10%, as required.  But no, the first answer I gave was graded wrong.  I tried computing the averages using two different methods, by averaging the hits or by summing the hits and then dividing by the total number of instances and, in each case, by subtracting the end result from 1, yielding the same, presumably wrong, answers both times."
"Hi All,"
Why does all the sentences clump into one big paragraph after you submit the essay assignment in paragraph format?
"The group meeting will cover human rights and to include issues like female status, negative rights, positive rights, human rights norms, and CEDAW treaty. Would you like me to submit a group meeting report to secure score points for the course to satisfy the group meeting component?"
is there some reason you don't use the `rfe` function in `caret`?
My progress says 99% done (I got some incorrect answers).
"And I too agree with the general sentiment here. Navigating the forum is almost terrible. Very difficult to see the list of forum topics. For example, if I need to look into discussions from week 1, it may take me forever to keep going down (loading more ) and at some point, I am going to give up. Not very user friendly at all. And I personally feel that for MOOCs, discussion forum is its best benefit. "
I know there was a discount for ESL Book.
"I have participated in 3 group meetings, but only 1 of them is shown on my progress chart.. What should I do about that?"

I did click in R Studio but the page came up with stuff about \""Frisbee Sailing\"" - for some reason R Studio doesn't have a really good view of everything when you open a workspace - not least it doesn't fill my screen.  I should have looked under Type in Windows to see R Workspace as the type.  "

It is. I can't submit any answers

"me too.... Price Ceiling -> Shortage, Price Flooring -> Surplus."
I have same kind of feeling! Answers are wrong! Not logic!
"Another aspect of this is, how much education do college basketball players actually receive?"
Answers to QUIZ: PRICE CEILINGS AND FLOORS are wrong. The explanation disagrees with the marked answers. Please check!
I had the same problem for questions 5 to 8! I just added a post
You're right! Official answers for questions 1 and 3 are wrong.
In my opinion these answers are not correct and they influence the percentage of right-answered questions by students.
I have the same problem. The grading is clearly wrong. It is of course also inconsistent with respect to surplus/shortage. 
"Also, when you changed the Q3 second question from .38 to .34, you should have reset all the submission.  When I posted my answer both were .38!"

But I can access the first week lecture on 27 June in Thailand because of slow connection in Myanmar. Is that illegible for my late study?
I think the influence of consumption  on PPC is the same as on GDP because the conception of GDP is total gross domestic production. What do you say?
Does anyone know if there is a formula to calculate the EQ price and quantity?
The grading is *obviously* wrong. But it doesn't look like anyone is listening ...
I hope any course staff member can help us to solve this confusion asap!!!
"As a determinant of supply curve, cost is decided by the input goods price and technology. If the price for input goods goes down, supply will be up. If better technologies are adopted,supply will also go up."
"Thinks about this a bit more, some of your analysis is correct but you are missing the supply side. Can this really be efficient in equilibrium? What happens if the price of housing is restricted? There will be a shortage (as is happening now.) Is this really good for consumers?"
rent control isn't economically efficient for landlords but efficient for renters.  Economy doesn't have to be always one sided point of view from the prospective of capital.high rents helps in increasing inequality and bad distribution by directing more money towards landlords and real estate market. Rent control is still used as public policy tool for two main reasons as far as I can see: in ideal situation I'd say that it is used to help the low and middle income people get proper living place and protect them from the greed of landlords but we don't have this ideal situation because the poll boxes are every where. 
"I wonder if economists can predict based on an idea, service, or product what the price elasticity of demand and supply will be. If so how does this determine where the price point is set? For some products, the market will be volatile based on external factors; however, no matter what the weather, season, time of day, etc. gas prices will always be stable. For that reason, should a businessperson concern themselves with what the predicted price elasticity is before entering a market?"
how to use supply and demand model to investigate while outside influence occurs such as weather changes?
"I agree with your approach to make that distinction. However, my question is why price changes when all other variables are keeping stable?"
Problem needs to be fixed.
"Very much agree, and I think the question should be rephrased to address this ambiguity. The difference between \tons of tea leaves shipped around the world\"" vs \""cups of a prepared beverage\"" is the difference between sugar being a complementary good vs a cost to the supplier, so it definitely changes the way you would think about the question."""
Hi. I believe I am entering the right answer to the Equilibrium price but I get an X. I am sure something is incorrect with the verification system.
The Financial Times article requires registration. Can the course staff provide login credentials or supply the text of the article?
Hello: I'd like to know if there is a due date for quizzes. Should they be completed on a weekly base?
This is also my question! I think that a individual firm can not affect a specific market !!!
"Would Wikipedia be an example of negative elasticity of supply? It's price has remained zero, but it's supply of articles has grown, and it appears that the fact that it is free is actually an incentive to add to the supply."
I can't see the article because I do not have a subscription.. anything I can do to get it?
Me too.. I am facing the same problem as you
I agree with Arisa but I would request course staff to confirm about this.
The Economist requires a subsciption to access article. How may I get article without cost?
I cannot fidn any economic explanations in the article for the increase in inequality in the 80s and 90s.
The article requires a subscription.. Kindly upload a copy of the same along with the course material.
"Thanks, I appreciate your reply. I did but the article linked is only the overview of a series of articles in a report.  With out buying a subscription to The Economist you can not read the full series and I was wondering if any one had was basing their response on more than the over view."
"Well, can the term opportunity be referred to as a loss due to the alternate choice we decide to choose? "

What can be different ways to express utility in number?
"Hey there, cant access the article."
"I'm in the group of people that thinks sugar is not used to make Tea, but rather sugar is an uncharged extra and is used by people who want to sweeten their Tea before drinking it. From this view, a reduction in sugar price will reduce the firm's (coffee/Tea house owners) costs and therefore increase the firm's profits. I don't see the firm changing the price of a cup of tea to the consumer."
Cant access the article
Yeah that makes sense. I'm wondering how we can put numbers inside the utility box as well. Where do the numbers come from?
"I agree, can the lecturer clear this up."
I just got a mail saying that this quiz question had a wrong answer and everyone will get full marks for this quiz. 
"For statement: ¡°The price of bicycles rose, and therefore the demand for bicycles went down.¡±"
i have some questions about this lecture 
"The article does not mention anything about the consumer's quantities and his willingness to pay for that particular quantity. What I can conclude from the information is that google is trying to gain a competitive edge by cutting down its prices, but I am not being able to derive a demand curve. Moreover, the article shows that the marginal benefit to google is increasing as it increased its storage quantity from 15GB to 1TB."
I think the answer is the following. 
I agree that this is highly counterintuitive. Shouldn't efficiency even increase with higher production levels thus progressively decreasing marginal cost?
Can somebody explain the scoring on the quiz as expressed in the progress section. I may be missing something but they don't jive with the points in the quiz itself. Thanks
So shall I do this course work alone and submit it or is there anyone interested to join for fun?

"I don't get the point of this graph re: combinations at all.  Given that you have already stated having more of a good never makes one worse off (quite an assumption, but okay) naturally we will have a higher level of utility in the upper right quadrant and a lower utility in the lower left quadrant- by definition. Note that in this example, the utility of 3 lbs of bananas and 1 lbs. of grapes is the same as 2 lbs. of each."
"If marginal cost equals price, why produce at all if the goal is to maximize profit? No profit is made as long as MC=P. Should the price be higher than what it costs to produce one more unit?"

"No explanation is given regarding the Amusement Park after you submit your answer.  I think the correct answer is that the Amusement Park is not an example of price discrimination as everyone is charged the same fee.  The stated correct answer of the golf clubs I view as price discrimination as there is likely a difference consumer who shops at Sports Authority than Amazon.  The Amazon shopper must have a computer and internet access and is also going to see on line many different prices for the same goods from both Amazon and third party vendors who utilize Amazon's services. The Sports Authority shopper will be going to a bricks and mortar store, to see the clubs, and may be willing to pay more for the customer service there, with less price sensitivity."

"I got the question wrong, too.  I guess the quiz was quizzing whether we understood the definition of histogram.  I since looked it up.  Apparently a histogram, by definition, means continuous data is shown.  If the continuous data had been changed into ordinal data (6 hrs, 7 hrs, 8 hrs, etc), then it would have been called a bar chart, not histogram.  That's my guess as to what's going on."
So is it safe to assume that if the data does not follow a standard distribution then we can go the Mann-Whitney test? Or is there some sort of pre-test that can be done to determine which test is best? thanks.

"I am trying to do question 3 in Homework 2 and have a question about rate ratios.  I teach math and in math we always teach students to save all rounding until the end.  If I compute the incidence rates (and keep all decimals in my calculator display) and then divide and only round at the end, I get a different answer (correct to 1 dp) than if I round each answer to 1 dp first and then divide.  I know which procedure (the first) is the most mathematically correct but I am not sure which procedure I am expected to follow in this course and the issue seems to be glossed over in the videos.  In Unit 2, Module 4 part 1, the video shows a calculation (at about 6:37) in which 7.3/1.7=4.2 but actually if you do 7.3/1.7, it is 4.29 (or 4.3 correct to 1 dp).  This has added to my confusion as to the procedure to follow in this course. It will make a difference as to the correctness of my homework."

The example was clear but some reason I just don't understand why not considering order would have the same probability since intuitively wouldn't a decrease in stringency increase the chance of it occurring?
It seem that authors have calculated adjusted OR using logistic regression and they got different OR?
it is still not clear to me.  why you multiply the the prevalence by the RR?

This question has been subjectively evaluated. I understand that odds ratio is highly misleading but it is statistically correct.

But it is marked as false and the solution shown \""xy.z\"" as the correct answer!!"
I was surprised that a predictive value was the answer because I didn't see a population prevalence in the question.  The situation the question presented  didn't make clear that the group of patients was sufficient to derive a prevalence.  It seemed to contradict the HIV and mammography example.  Any help or advice you can give to clarify my thinking process would be appreciated.  In other words (as I am seeing it) you can make up a prevalence in one situation but not in another.  So - when can you make it up rather than ensure the prevalence is a proper number?  Thank you
"I have needed in the past to review articles which report ORs, and I had gotten the *gist* of what they are before I started this course. This course has helped me to understand more precisely what they are now, and that has helped brilliantly. However, these days we need to be very careful when reviewing data submitted in artciles and checking that conclusions made from the analysis are logical and supported by the data themselves. All too often we get articles which draw conclusions which are not supported by the analysis, or in which half of the blatently obvious implications are overlooked/ignored/manipulated in phraseology (similar to the Vioxx study). My chief seems to have forgotten his statistical knowledge, e.g. when I point out columns in chart data with very overlapping SD bars which are marked as significant, he is not always as concerned as I am.

In HIV case, I believe we need a known value from database such as incidence rate or prevalence, then taking specific sample sizes (like <zipRedac>0000) computer every time calculates diseased of that <zipRedac>0k and the difference between groups. But could simulation be generated for example for ages of population? We actually need some virtual database of ages, computer cannot take randomly age of 200 years"

"I submitted HW4 and was marked wrong for Q10.  I believe the value given as an answer shows the probability of 113 or more (instead of 112 or more).  The cumulative probability should not be calculated up to 112 as shown in the answer because when you subtract that from 1, you end up with the probability of 113 or more (since this is count data and there can be no x values between 111 and 112, or between 112 and 113).  I believe the correct approach is to calculate the cumulative probability up to and including 111 (not 112), then subtract that result from 1 to get the probability of 112 or more.  Please advise."

I worked the question correct up through calculating the Z score and got 1.6970 (solution shows 1.7). The last step shows that the answer should be 0.045 whereas using the table I had thought it should have been 0.4554. Am I misinterpreting something?
"In the example in part 2 of module1, at 1.50, p(x<2)=1-e raised to power negative 2 is equals .135, what's the value of e? How's e raised to power negative 2 equal to .135?"
I tried blowing up the portion of the histogram for the heterozygote portion and putting it on top of the histogram for the homozygote wild type portion. They kind of look like the same distribution to me when I do that. It looks like the variability is similar at least. Is it valid to scale histograms like this to do a visual comparison of distributions/variability? I held down shift (in photoshop) when doing the scaling which I think should preserve the proportions.  ![The image with the smaller histogram overlaid on the larger is here][1]. 
"The lecturer states: \Essentially, conceptually, p values give you the probability that the observed effect could have arisen by chance\"".  This can be confusing.  She might have said more accurately \""conceptually, p values give you the probability that the observed effect could have arisen if the null hypothesis were true\"" which is what she did say in the sentence before. There should be an underlying assumption that the result (and any result) is chance and the p value measures the probability of that chance finding if the null hypothesis were true, ie what are the chances of getting that finding if the null hypothesis is true not what is the chance the finding arose by chance.  The p value can't measure the probability of it being a chance finding but rather the chance of the finding given the null hypothesis. If the value seems too extreme then you either 1)reject the null hypothesis or 2)conjecture that you have witnessed a very low probability event. This is a very important distinction.  Or am I misunderstanding something?"""
"Hi there,"
Is there any standard R function for calculation of a variance of probability distribution (like var() for sample variance)? Thanks in advance.
"Hi. Thank you for this lecture, very thought-provoking."
"this is really helpful thanx a lot <redacted>, but why the confidence interval is usually set at 95% by researches, and you rarely see someone using the 99 or 99.9% is it of no significant effect if we use more than 95% as Z value?"
Is there a difference between N and n in the formula for the variance of a sample S^2 (around 4:51 in the video)?
"Can't we say that the Standard Error always refers to the variance of a statistic, unlike the Standard Deviation which is a variance of a characteristic?"
"In unit 4 modules, it is mentioned that the corresponding value of z is calculated using the z-chart. However, the in the unit 4 homework, the values used are very different from the chart and coincide only then the online statistical Calcultor is used. Please explain the reason for this."
Did anyone try this with an exact binomial prob calculator?
Oh I was going to ask about this.
"Tarek & Huik, thank you this makes it much clearer.  I'm still a bit baffle since central limit theorem (CLT) seem to be able to coerce most data (given n is great enough) into a bell shape - so does this implies that if n is great enough then tests for normality eg Kolmogorov-Smirnov) are not necessary? Or are there limitation as to CLT? thanks."
"For question 11, how can I estimate the standard deviation from the histogram? Or should we calculate the probability of getting 63 heads and 90 tails in 153 coin tosses to calculate the p value?"
"The \p\"" value used in the formula ?_ = np(1-p) is the probability of success for X or, in other words, the actual proportion for the POPULATION. But here we only have the proportion for the SAMPLE (n = 1064), so p ? 0.59 unless we somehow know that the proportion found in the sample is *exactly* the proportion in the population.

I think this completely changes the answer in Q2."""
Why in statistics when something comes to negative numbers always squares are used? It is not very precise when larger numbers increase more because of squaring. In computer code it's really easy to type root of square of a number (taking absolute value).
In the example we are trying to determine sample size for 2 groups of 30 doctors. I assume that is an error (the reference to 30 should be removed) and we are asking how many doctors we need in each group. Is there another interpretation?

"Hi, Confused again. Sorry. The trial was for <zipRedac>000 times of simulation and the actual difference between vaccine group and placebo group is just 2.7. Located it to the chart, the p value is quite big. How can the question <zipRedac>4 mention that the p value is smaller than the 2009 HIV vaccine trial which is showed in the video as 0.04 based on the effect size of 23 (differences of vaccine and placebo) on a group of over 8000. Should we expand the difference to <zipRedac>0000 group size, like 2.7--->27?"
I would appreciate some hints. The p values I got in these questions were very different which may suggest I am missing the point. Do we use Z in 12 and do we double it for 2 tails?
I am still stuck..can someone help me a bit more? I really am trying.
I am not sure how to interpret the 2x2 table
"I am curious, from somebody who has submitted the HW and been correct, or if somebody knows specifically. do we give our answers for #11 and 12 as percentages or as probability (decimals) ? In the lectures she gives p-values as percentages, but #12 makes more sense relative to #11 if I give a decimal (she says to give answer to thousandths). Also, if we should give percentage, do we use the % sign? I hunted around the site and the wiki for clarification and found none."
"Hi Raj, thanks for your helpful comments.  "
Why do we assume the type I error rate is 5%? Is this an arbitrary selection such as p- value .05 or has this rate been measured consistently in studies?
"Just watched the video on this topic.  With regards to the end of the video, it is stated that with large enough sample sizes we should focus our attention on clinical significance rather than statistical significance."
"1. \The real trial used an intention to treat analysis\"" Does this imply that  the analysis for the real trial used less than 2.8 fewer infections per 1000 vaccinated ?"

Hi - Could Dr. <redacted> or one of the TAs help clarify a few questions I have on the questions on breast cancer and coffee/tea consumption:
My first question is whether the central limit theorem only valid for the distribution of sample means or has been shown true for other statistics?
"In the example, the expected SD is 10, however lets say we want to calculate the power for a difference in weight gain in two fish species, each of the species baseline weight has different standard deviation (lets say species A mean is 5 grams, and .2 sd and species B mean is 6 and .5 sd) if we wanted to calculate the power, whic SD do we use? thanks."
But what is not clear to me: do they compared the side effects beween placebo/treatment in the same person? or they just get compared the global result plecebo vs treatmet ? This changes the experimental unit...
"Is there a general tendency in p-value (say, generally too optimistic, or too pesimistic) when someone, instead of testing for normality, directly uses \alternate\"" tests (such as wilcoxon rank-sum) instead of the right statistical test (e.g. ttest)?"
"Hi Dr. <redacted> - Thanks for the response. (1) the n I saw in the question for Homework 6 are the n's mentioned in the tables. Table 2 was the adjusted odds ratios for premenonpausal women (n=878) then in Table 3, the n = 2949. Then further down the question the author mentioned looking at ductal (1008 cases) vs. lobular CA (181 cases). It appeared to me that the count in the study described referred to the cancer cases and not the person. So, the cases are not totally independent since a person can also have more than one cancer at the same time. Is that the right reasoning? (2) I am also having a hard time figuring out the unit of observation, since it is an association of two different factors: caffeine consumption and breast cancer. Should I look at it as the caffeine is the exposure and the breast cancer is the effect? Thanks again for the help and the wonderful course."
"In this lecture, I learned that the correlation coefficient zero doesn't necessarily means there is no  correlation. It just means there are no linear correlation."

"I'm with some of you on this one too!  While there is no relationship between the individuals, the people who drink a lot of caffeinated coffee might be the same ones who drink a lot of black tea, so if the authors tried to draw conclusions (e.g. one or the other is better at preventing cancer) then there would be correlation between the groups, right?  Another example: what if the beneficial effect of black tea were negated by decaf coffee?  There could be lots of interactions, so wouldn't correlation exist in the data unless they found individuals who drank one and only one of the three beverages?"

"I posted this a bit ago, but no one answered.  I'm guessing my post got buried in all the other posts.  So I was hoping a new thread would bring my question into a spotlight so that it may get answered.  I'm just really curious about this.  I'll copy my prior post here:"
"Drinking coffee doesn't make you a women, and drinking coffee doesn't cause menopause (although it may very well effect the onset). Coffee drinking is not dependent on gender, and I think this why the variables are independent. If I am wrong, please someone correct me as this question puzzled me too."
"Dr. <redacted>, Given your response \(2) No, these variables may be correlated.\"", I don't understand why the response to question 6, True or False -- \""The observations in this study are correlated\"" was 'False'. "
It means independent variables can have quadratic relationship?
Could someone elaborate how to get standard error here?
"Imagine we have ~10 people, each performing the same task a few dozens of times. So we record their performance each time, and want to tell whether the difference is statistically significant or not."

"Hi,"
wilcox rank-sum test assumes the observations are independent whereas wilcox sign-rank test is used when the observations are correlated. The observations in the said randomized trials were correlated. So according to the table and stated in the early part of the lecture the sign-rank test should be used. So is the table wrong ? If so then the sign-rank test is meaningless since generally we are interested in the between group effects. That's my confusion
"If I follow the logic of the sunscreen case, the null hypothesis would be there is no association between exposure to PERC and Parkinson's disease.

"I think one of the most frustrating things regarding this course involves the homework. In my mind, quizzes would prepare one for the homework, but this is very rarely the case. The homework questions are often far advanced compared to the very easy quiz questions. Additionally, having fill-in-the-blank questions is frustrating because, when doing very complicated calculations by hand, one tiny mistake could throw off the answer drastically. If there were multiple choice questions, I think that would be a better test of true understanding...I have often completely understood the material and the concepts presented but lost points on homework due to math mistakes. "

"Hi Marabout,"
I have a question that has bothered me for a while and I would appreciate if anyone could help. It is related to hypothesis testing.
"In first example null is p(a) = 0 , alternate that p(a) is not = 0 , P-value = 0.01 so **we reject the null & conclude that alternate is true . Its a positive study & at 0.01 'observed significance level' we conclude that 'a' is a feasibility & p (a) is positive** . ( **note**: p(a) < 0 doesn't make any sense & to that extent the alternate is flawed & the correct alternate should be p(a) > 0 , that means a one sided one . Another point is p(a) notation should better be p(A) as 'events' are usually dented by capital alphabets . ) However in second case the null is p(b) = 0 , the alternate p(b) > 0 ( see my note above ) & p-value 0.99 . So given the data **we fail to reject the null . So the study fails to conclude that p( b ) > zero & is a null study  . But it doesn't automatically proves the null for which we need altogether different study called non-inferiorty trial or equivalence trial . However extreme p-value of 0.99 you chose , does call for expert comment here** . I recommend that you go through  unit 6 , module 5 which is devoted precisely to answer this very question or rather entire topic in good detail ."
So there are 2 betas - It is simply missing (by mistake?) in one of the slides?

"If you had a woman who dropped out at 6 months, you can't ignore the fact that she was at risk of developing the outcome in question during the 6-month period she was in the study. She could have developed the outcome, but didn't. That means that her data contribute something to the study. If you keep her data in, the overall likelihood of any patient developing the outcome up until the point she dropped out will be lower than if you took her data out (because her contribution make the denominator higher by 1 person). If the study had planned to end at 6 months, you would have been OK with including her data - so it should be no different if she later drops out because her inclusion affects only the data up to 6 months. You can't do clinical studies without patients dropping out, so you have to accommodate that fact rather than ignore it."

I have learned from other advices for scientific writing that the most important part must always be put at the beginning of the sentence even if it is used the passive voice. For example ¡°The first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star was taken in 2010 by NASA¡¯s Hubble Space Telescope¡± clearly sets the order of importance: the first picture>2010>NASA> the telescope. If we write the sentence in active voice:¡± NASA¡¯s Hubble Space Telescope has taken in 2012 the first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star¡± we relegate the most interesting part of the sentence/paper.

"I have a question about optimism as a quantitative variable , optimism is an ordinal variable because the way it was measured on a scale from 0 -100 so I can say that scale 10 is higher than scale 5 but does it have a meaning to say that I'm higher by 5 points or that I'm twice optimistic ?? "

"I think it it similar to mean and standard deviation. If within 3 standard deviation from mean, we have 99% data. So here is median, and 3 quantile(1 for 3/4 quantile and 1/4 quantile plus Q3 + 1.5 * IQR and Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) from median."
"I agree. My understanding is that these are Categorical (Ordinal) data as a score of 50 does not mean that that the person is half as optimistic as someone with a score of 100. You can't add, subtract, multiply or divide these data and they only denote a \order\"", i.e., a person with a score of 50 is considered more optimistic than one with a score of 25- and hence classed as Ordinal."

"The question about using n or n-1 frequently comes up in biology research.  In some experiments (eg. clinical trials, some types of cell culture experiments), n may be large and dividing by n versus n-1 may make very little difference.  However, most research experiments have a much smaller n, almost always less than 10 and often less than 5.  In this case, dividing by n-1 may make a huge difference.  "

"Oh, good to see I'm not the only one to struggle with this question! I've managed to do the 2x2 table (5+1=6 discordant pairs, the example from Module 4 mislead me too) but, when I check my p value using a stats website I get a veeeeryyy different p value that is non significant. I guess I'll stick to the one I got using the binomial approach."
"Looks like we got the same one : I did 6 choose 0 too. Intuitively I'd say it's correct to find a significant p value, since there are 4 excess cases in the exposed group."
"In the ttest example based on math SAT scores, a two-sample ttest is selected because the data is uncorrelated. However, from the info provided on the actual study, I understood the female group to have been matched with a random sample of males, to account for socioeconomic status, level of education and so on. If this is correct, then I am confused about why this data would be classed as uncorrelated. Can anyone explain this to me please?"
Hi!
I tried two on line calculators and got p values a little higher than my math; I think we agree that the p value is between .1 and .2 yes?
"OK, I do not think we are supposed to calculate 3 scenarios, so we can pick either discordant pair, 5 or 1 and solve, e.g., 6C5 and then the more extreme is what if NONE of them occurred?  6C0 and then add those 2 probabilities together?"
"What?  Yes, Josh, I have watched it over and over again, she only did two calculations. She chose one of the pairs and then chose an extreme.  She had N = 7 and X=0 and then she did if X=7; in our case the N = 6 and we have a 5 and a 1, not a 7 and 0.  So our N=6 and I thought we could choose to do either x=5 or x=1 (the two discordant pairs); then I thought the extreme was either 6C6 or 6C0 which in my math is the same probability.  So I did 6C5*.5^5*.5^1 and added that probability to 6C6*.5^6*.5^0; for a p above .05 but less than the p values we get from an online calculator.  I think I have given substantial effort to trying to find the missing piece, but I just don't know what else to do.  I wonder if my classmates have had better luck?"

"As a new teacher who was a career-switcher from engineering, I stepped into the classroom thinking that if I am given a class of \honors\"" high school students then they should have all the basic math skills, a firm grasp of algebra, and be up for challenges.  Boy was I wrong.  It is my biggest frustration.  How do you overcome this?  How do you get students who have been told their whole lives that they are gifted in math to dig in, persevere, accept a challenge, and be willing to go back and work on concepts that they previously \""learned\""?  They are so procedural that they can't apply to a different scenario.  And my colleagues don't want to collaborate to come up with better solutions.  Their solution is to give them more worksheets and work out more example problems.  But this just makes it worse because the students memorize the examples and then wonder why they fail quizzes.  Anyway.  Sorry for venting a bit here.  I am really hoping for some good suggestions to change their mindset.  Thanks."""

"Our school first assigns students in classes with SPED and gifted together (because they get extra support/time away from the homeroom) and then fill in slots to form their version of heterogeneous classes of about 32 students.  Our administrators do not believe in retaining students so at the fourth grade level you receive students that read first grade thru seventh grade level.  So we have such a broad range with some students that can't read/comprehend questions while others breeze through everything.  We are made to teach in timed blocks...1 1/2 hr. reading, 1 hr. math, 40 mins. for SS, 40 mins. for Science, and 30 mins. for writing.  We receive negative comments on evals if we go over 5 mins. We have an assistant occasionally (1/2 rdg, 1/2 hr math).  Teaching to the middle would leave the majority of the class lost or bored.  Trying to do guided math with 6 at a time is impossible with so many students and the limited time.  The past 2 years, the school's solution was to rotate and create homogeneous groups for math so that teaching to the middle would be more effective and as much intervention/guided math as possible would compliment.  My philosophy differs....Maybe we should not focus on grades (promote/retain) as much as on skill/concept achievement or have transitional classes.  The 'first grade level' students often become frustrated and become behavior problems because they need so many learning experiences and there is not adequate time due to pacing and benchmark testing.   I think we need more instructional support/smaller class sizes and they should be heterogeneous.  The jump that doubles the class size and 75% of the students did not master third grade is tough!   Ideas????"
"I truly wish I knew the actual answer.  It took me quite sometime to really wrap my head around the question and took the better of 2 hours to figure it out.  I felt the task which first asked \How do you see the shapes growing?\"" gave me an entry point.  I experimented with different paths and strategies, and I knew or at least I think I knew exactly what you were asking for."

The results show <zipRedac> of those variables were significant. I then ran the regression again using only those five significant variables.    I was surprised that only <zipRedac> of the <zipRedac> were significant.  I would have thought all five would have remained significant (and become more so).

In that regard, why ignore the enteric nervous system entirely?

Is there a thought on repetitive acute stress response for positive adaptation vs medium chronic stress that would be seen in elite athletics or military groups/populations?

"I understand that k-fold cross validation is used to get an estimate of test error, but I do not see how it helps in selecting the best model.

I tried this and got a wrong result (0.032)?
Is it legit to use K-fold cross-validation to select your tuning parameters **and** to estimate your test set error? I suspect some over fitting here.

Is there any formal selection procedure (akin to forward/backward selection) to select interaction terms, too?

I just want to clarify my thinking to make sure I get this: So, for question 4, the confidence interval would be wider if instead of sampling 100 women we sample 50 women and 50 men.

Then in question 5, the reason the confidence interval would be narrower when we increase the number of subject in the sampling is the higher the n the more accurate our data will be and therefore CI would be narrower.

In slide 59:  Does it matter that the numbers for the non-significant trend group are so small?  I guess I'm asking how do such small numbers (especially compared to the significant) affect the overall model.  Does it force the higher number to be even more significant than they are.  Maybe these questions will be more evident to me when I review again - but so far reviewing hasn't helped.  So I'm hoping you can see my confusion and clarify the thinking.

Bars in the histogram on sleep duration.<br>
I am so confused about the interpretation of the risk ratio for example 
Could you please explain it. For example if the study was less than 1 year - 7 months. In order to calculate incidence we need person-years of follow up - should we multiply 7 month by number of people in the study. For example it was 100 people. Will it be this way - (100*7/12)-cause in a year its a 12 month. I am very confused with this. And do wee need to calculate person-years of follow-up every time we calculate incidence. Cause i used to have another calculation for incidence = (new cases of the disease divided by population at risk to have this disease at some period of time) - i didn't use person-years of follow-up in this calculation. Please help.
Why do we have to substract the risk ration from 1 to get the %increase or decrease in the risk for an event? where did that 1 came from?

"In the lecture it is argued that there are two drawbacks of LOOCV in comparison to five- or tenfold cross validation. The first is computational burden, which I understand. But the second argument is that the variance of LOOCV is larger. This certainly is true for one particular instance. But to estimate the test error you average over all n 'leave one out' models. As I do the math, I see that the variance of the test error estimate using LOOCV is exactly equal to the variance of the test error estaimate using five- or tenfold averaging. Where do I go wrong?"

I am bit confused on this question to find the coefficients of x (to within 10%)?

"In the previous lectures about crossvalidation, we have been informed to do model selection (feature selection) within the crossvalidation step, but in the Chapter 6 lectures they select the most predictive variables for each model of dimension d, to later perform crossvalidation across dimensions. Isn't this contradictual?"
"After running lasso or ridge regression and using k-fold cross-validation, presumably one has k estimates of the model coefficients for each lambda.  After choosing a lambda, one is still left with the entire cross-validation set for that lambda.  And even when regularization is not being done the same is true -- there will be k sets of coefficients and standard errors."
Say you have a large number of categorical predictors x and you fit a model using lasso that picks the best components of x that influence the dependent variable y. As discussed in the lecture lasso will tend to throw out correlated dimensions of x. 
I am looking at this problem and I am not sure where to even start. I mean I can guess that it should be somewhere in the order of 90-95% but I have no idea how to get an actual answer. How did other people start this off?

"Thanks for a great course, but in the section on the physiology of changes in pressure, I am wondering why nitrogen causes all the problems?  It diffuses into the tissue and then when decompressed, causes bubbles which leads to all kinds of problems, but why nitrogen and not oxygen.  Sure nitrogen is more plentiful, but at 21% oxygen is no slouch.  Also, sometimes they up the oxygen at the expense of the nitrogen, so I don't think that is it. Could it be that diatomic oxygen is more polar and stays dissolved longer?  If polarity had anything to do with it, then why do they put inert gases in there?  Neon for example is a noble gas which has no polarity, but maybe the inert gases don't even attract itself so perhaps ot won't coalesce into bubbles?  Just guessing here, but would really like to understand why nitrogen causes all the problems and not other gases.  Thanks again."

I thought the answer was B. However, apparently \""quantity demanded\"" and \""supply\"" are not at all the same - only the quantity demanded increases to meet the demands of the consumer, but the supply itself does not increase.

Now if you survive five more, you'll make it into the lucky 20, otherwise you'll be in the unlucky 40. I don't see how the conditional probability is the whole number (if 5, then 10)."
"Okay, feeling like a total idiot here.  s= 280/7=6.3  How does one arrive at the 280?  I thought I was far better at math than this, but anything I try is not coming up with 280.  Help, please I'm stuck and can't move on until I capture this."
"Hi,"
I am confused about below homework questions in unit1 question set 3
Thank you very much for your reply.
"When calculating the normal approximation for the binomial do we use half intervals e.g. 111.5 instead of 112 if we're looking for the area to the right in the curve; and can we use a different normal distribution applet than the ones recommended. If so, what are the answer tolerances. Can one be several tenths of a percentage point off. This ambiguity is killing me. Literally, I'm dying."
Thanks Sally! 
I cannot understand how the ORs have been calculated although those are not directly related to the correct answers.
This unit is way too hard. I haven't understood much from the videos. :'(
"for the h/w question about AK I want to say that unit of observation is half face. Can I do that even though they \use half-side comparison of side of the scalp and/or face?\"" "
I have a few questions.
So I'm attempting to clear up my own confusion here:
I don't fully understand how to plug numbers into the law of total probability formula. From the example given at 12:20 this is how I plug numbers into the formula: P(test+)=P(.991/.03)P(.03)+P(.991/.97)P(.97).
I understand how to work the problem. I don't understand the interpretation. Where did loss of 5 cents come from? Which is just under zero? What does that mean?
Hello!
"I have been trying these problems for 4 hours, have read the posts, and redone the videos...and I cannot figure out where to start. I do not understand which formulas to use, and I dont understand how to look at a histogram and determine an estimate for a p value. I have also been online and read many posts on this. Can someone help me, direct me to where this is clearly explained in the videos? Or just give me a hint. I have the rest of the homework done, I am just really stuck. Thank you..."
I am very confused by the range of answers available for this question. Perhaps someone can help me out.
I understand that we should compare the results for the adjusted and unadjusted $
Is it possible that somebody address the point of this question and others like it? Are we supposed to look at only composite results for both? Do we only look at DHA or DHA and AA? Do we look at both breastfeeding sets of scores? If I knew or could help I would. You won't be revealing anything crucial to the outcome. People will still need to make computations and then make a decision.
I think this is a kind of practical issue beyond the course.

"Is there a help file of some sort explaining how the quiz software works?  Sorry to be dense, but I can't figure out what it's doing.  Can I go to the end of a chapter and do all the quiz questions?  If I get an answer wrong, what should I do?  What does the given number of \submits\"" mean?  Do I have to \""Save\""?  What if I don't?"""

"Having exhausted my tries, I must concede defeat on 9.R.  If a correct worked solution could be sent to me by email, I would very appreciative.  I clearly had problems getting the data structure right.  I read earlier posts relating to this question and thought I saw where I was going wrong, but my final attempt was also wrong! I would be most interested in learning what I was doing wrong.  Frustratingly, I thought I understood what was required to answer the three components of the question, but clearly I did not."
I had this otest all wrong as I must have not understood anything.

"Quiz week 9 asks : what will be the percentage change in prices? Express your answer as a real number taken to the hundredth place. I do not understand how the answer has to be reported. IF the answer is say 5% then we are supposed to answer as 5.00 or as .05 ? I had used firt format of 5.00 but got answer wrong .. (I have changed the figure so as not to disclose the answer, just need clarification on format in which answer is to be submitted."
"Seriously, have you looked at those questions in light of the material in the lecture? You either need to do a helluva lot better job of explaining the difference between supervised or unsupervised learning, or you need to write questions that are decidable based on the information available in the lecture."
"I am all confused about this caloric thing. First, as pointed out, how much do you eat and how do you go about it : Do you actually measure the amount of calories you are taking now and arrive at a new calorific value as some percentage of that, fix it and keep a calculator permanently on your table? Second, what about the mental and physical effects - won't you get an ulcer, can you think about anything else except food when you are always hungry? Third, with such amazing coping mechanisms can the body be so wrong   in sending us hunger signals - doesn't it know when it has had enough?"
